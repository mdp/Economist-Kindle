    <h1>Deep trouble</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>America&#8217;s distorted energy markets, not just its coastline, need cleaning up</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE explosion that claimed 11 lives and sent the Deepwater Horizon, a billion-dollar oil rig, to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, was bad enough. But for the inhabitants of America&#8217;s Gulf coast, for BP, the huge British firm that owns the well, and for the oil industry as a whole, the bad news is flowing as relentlessly as the oil gushing from ruptured pipes a mile below the waves (see ). Efforts to close an emergency shut-off valve have failed. BP is trying to drop huge domes over the leaks and siphon off the oil they collect. But if that fails, it could be months before a second well is completed, reducing the pressure in the first and thus stemming the flow.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some two weeks after the initial accident, oil has begun to wash up on the frail marshes and rich oyster beds that line Louisiana&#8217;s shores. Pictures of basted seabirds and gasping turtles have engulfed the media. Commercial fishing has been suspended in the vicinity of the spill. There is talk that the slick could wash up on Florida&#8217;s west coast, smothering the lucrative local tourism industry, or even leach into the Atlantic and up America&#8217;s eastern seaboard, abetted by the Gulf Stream.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Investors, foreseeing vast bills for cleaning and compensation, have wiped some $30 billion off BP&#8217;s value. Other firms involved, including Anadarko, one of BP&#8217;s partners in the ill-fated well, Transocean, which was in charge of the drilling, Halliburton, which fitted the cement cap that was supposed to have sealed the well, and Cameron, which made the failed backup system, have also been walloped. Congress has summoned executives from these firms for pillorying. Moves are afoot to lift the cap on oil firms&#8217; liability for the economic damage done by oil spills from $75m to $10 billion (they are already on the hook for unlimited clean-up costs).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The oil industry&#8217;s hope that more American waters would be opened to drilling is receding as fast as the slick advances. Barack Obama, who had briefly supported the idea, has put all drilling on hold while the causes of the disaster are investigated. The governors of Florida and California have retracted their support too. &#8220;Why&#8221;, asks California&#8217;s Arnold Schwarzenegger, &#8220;would we want to take on that kind of risk?&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Slick salesmen</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Because that is where the oil is, oilmen retort. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for almost a third of America&#8217;s oil production and the lion&#8217;s share of new discoveries. Most dry land has been picked over, and better technology allows exploration in ever deeper waters. Elsewhere too, Western oil firms are being forced offshore as nationalist governments curtail their involvement in big, easily tapped fields on land. The Gulf of Mexico and the waters off Africa and Brazil are among the most enticing prospects to which they still have access. If Americans do not want to hand even more money and clout to the likes of Iran, Russia and Venezuela, the argument runs, they should not curb offshore drilling. Even if they do, rising oil powers such as Angola and Brazil are not going to follow suit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Moreover, in America at least, oil firms have been reasonable stewards of the seas. Before Deepwater Horizon foundered there had not been a big leak from an offshore oil well for 40 years. Average annual spills from underwater pipelines declined from 2.5m gallons in 1980-84 to just 12,000 gallons in 2000-04, according to the Congressional Research Service. America&#8217;s National Research Council reckons that offshore drilling accounts for 1% of the oil floating in the country&#8217;s waters, and tankers and pipelines only a further 4%, compared with 33% from other shipping and 62% from natural seepage (though the industry&#8217;s spills are more concentrated, and so more harmful). As the fleet of 200 ships battling the slick shows, oil firms have elaborate plans to mop up leaks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In this instance the oil spilled is quite volatile, so much of it should disperse or evaporate before reaching the coast, where it will do the most damage. The warmth of the air and water in the Gulf should also help. Since the well is 40 miles offshore and the weather has been relatively clement, there has been time to test dispersal techniques and prepare coastal defences.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Rigged result</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For all these reasons, the long-term repercussions of the spill may not be so grave. BP, its subcontractors, federal and state governments, environmental activists, injured businesses and their insurers will all spend decades suing one another. The Supreme Court, after all, took almost 20 years to settle the punitive damages arising from the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> spill off Alaska in 1989. But Exxon&#8217;s share price quickly recovered from that accident (followed, more slowly, by the local environment); it went on to become the world&#8217;s biggest listed firm. BP, which made profits of $5.6 billion in the first quarter of this year, will not be crippled by the spill (see ), even if its costs run into billions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Congress will stiffen oversight of offshore drilling and boost the penalties for lapses. Fewer states will open their waters to oilmen&#8212;although the governor of Virginia, for one, says he is still willing. But there will not, sadly, be any more comprehensive effort to account for the noxious side-effects of oil. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For spills are hardly the most baleful consequence of America&#8217;s oil addiction: global warming and the funding of foreign despots surely come higher up the list. Perversely, this spill is likely to set back efforts to get a bill on climate change through Congress, and to increase the flow of dollars to despots (see ). However you measure the full cost of a gallon of gas, pollution and all, Americans are nowhere close to paying it. Indeed, their whole energy industry&#8212;from subsidies for corn ethanol to limited liability for nuclear power&#8212;is a slick of preferences and restrictions, without peer. The tinkering that will follow this spill will merely further complicate it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Offshore drilling seems like a sensible way to obtain a very handy product. Extra safeguards may be needed. But if the politicians are really as committed to &#8220;cleaning up&#8221; the energy industry as they now claim, far more could be achieved by reducing the subsidies and introducing a carbon tax. That may seem a long way from the calamity in the Gulf; but in the long run those other murky waters also need to be cleaned up. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>The crisis in <strong>Greece</strong> turned violent as demonstrators took to the streets to protest against the latest austerity measures imposed by the government following the approval of a joint IMF-EU bail-out package. On May 5th, three people were killed in Athens after the bank in which they worked was set on fire by protesters. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After weeks of hesitation, <strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose government will provide the biggest chunk of EU funding to Greece, became the bail-out&#8217;s biggest cheerleader, declaring that the future of Europe was at stake. The German parliament was due to approve the deal only two days before a crucial election in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany&#8217;s biggest state. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s government, already beset by in-fighting, faced a further headache when Claudio Scajola, <strong>Italy&#8217;s</strong> minister for economic development, resigned to defend himself against allegations of corruption over a property deal. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Following a parliamentary vote, <strong>Belgium</strong> was poised to become the first European country to ban women from wearing Islamic veils that cover the face, such as the burqa or niqab. The French National Assembly is to debate a possible burqa ban shortly and legislation may follow.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The horse-trading goes on</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Iraq&#8217;s</strong> incumbent prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, whose Shia-dominated electoral alliance was narrowly defeated by a group led by a former prime minister, Iyad Allawi, made a deal with the third-placed group, the Iraqi National Alliance, a religiously oriented Shia group. But Iraq&#8217;s Sunni minority would be outraged if Mr Allawi, a secular Shia with strong Sunni support, were excluded from a government. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indirect talks between <strong>Israel </strong>and mainstream <strong>Palestinians </strong>were set to resume under American mediation after the 22-member Arab League endorsed the conditions. The Palestine Liberation Organisation, a national umbrella, was expected to follow suit. George Mitchell, Barack Obama&#8217;s envoy to the Middle East, went to the region to meet the leaders of both sides.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Umaru Yar&#8217;Adua, <strong>Nigeria&#8217;s</strong> president, who has not been seen in public for six months, died. His vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, has been sworn in as his replacement. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Mauritius</strong>, one of Africa&#8217;s most democratic and prosperous countries, held a general election. In a closely fought vote, the prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam, was up against Paul B\xE9renger, whom he defeated five years ago.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Russian forces have freed the crew of a Russian oil tanker captured by <strong>Somali pirates</strong> off the coast of Yemen.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Staying put</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a botched about-turn, Yukio Hatoyama, <strong>Japan&#8217;s</strong> prime minister, conceded that his plan to remove an American military base from the island of Okinawa was not feasible. The retreat provoked a storm of protest on the island but no expression of support from Washington. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In what is thought to be his first trip abroad since 2006, Kim Jong Il of <strong>North Korea</strong> was spotted in <strong>China</strong>, heading towards Beijing for talks. The visit was shrouded in official secrecy. Neither side would confirm it was happening. But Mr Kim wants aid for his country and China wants the north to return to the six-party talks about dismantling his nuclear programme. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Indonesia&#8217;s</strong> respected finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, resigned to become a managing director of the World Bank. She has been widely praised for her role in reforming the economy and steering it through the global crisis. She denies wrongdoing in a criminal investigation into a 2008 bank bail-out.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Thailand&#8217;s</strong> prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, offered to hold early elections in November as part of a deal to end the confrontation with red-shirt protesters who have paralysed the capital, Bangkok, for two months. In response the red shirts demanded a fixed date for the dissolution of parliament and said they would continue their protests.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Muhammad Ajmal Qasab, a Pakistani, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by an <strong>Indian</strong> court for his role in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, in which 174 people died.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>A new South American group</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>N\xE9stor Kirchner, <strong>Argentina&#8217;s</strong> former president and the husband of the current president, was chosen as the first secretary-general of Unasur, a new South American political bloc. <strong>Uruguay</strong> had previously vetoed his selection because of a border dispute, but Jos\xE9 Mujica, the country&#8217;s new president, allowed it to go ahead.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A truth commission began investigating the coup that toppled Manuel Zelaya, the former president of <strong>Honduras</strong>, last year. The commission&#8217;s legitimacy has been questioned by critics who argue its work cannot take place under the auspices of a government that was elected under the coup regime. Some of Mr Zelaya&#8217;s supporters claim the investigation will only serve to exonerate the coup&#8217;s leaders.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Bolivia</strong> nationalised four electricity companies, two of which had European owners or partners. The government promised it would lower tariffs by 20% after the expropriation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In what looks like a further attempt to centralise power, Ra\xFAl Castro, the president of <strong>Cuba</strong>, fired the country&#8217;s ministers of sugar and transport. His government&#8217;s official statement said they were removed for poor job performance.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Foiled again</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An improvised car-bomb, made from propane gas canisters and fireworks, failed to detonate at Times Square in <strong>New York</strong>. The law-enforcement agencies quickly identified a suspect, Faisal Shahzad, an American citizen of Pakistani extraction. They then lost track of him, but managed to arrest him on board a plane that was just about to take off for Dubai. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>America</strong> has announced how many active warheads it has in its nuclear arsenal. The figure&#8211;5,113&#8211;was in line with previous estimates, but Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of the disclosure as a show of transparency.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Powerful thunderstorms triggered flooding across the <strong>American south-east</strong>, leaving at least 29 people dead in Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi. Nashville was badly affected.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>Tony Hayward, the boss of BP, said the company would honour all &#8220;legitimate&#8221; claims for damages in the wake of the <strong>oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</strong>. Existing American law would cap BP&#8217;s liability at $75m, but there have been calls for a retrospective change that could see it rise to as much as $10 billion. The oil firm said it was hopeful that a 100-tonne containment box, being shipped to the site of the leak, will stem the flow of oil. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The euro hit a one-year low against the dollar as fears spread over <strong>Europe&#8217;s financial stability</strong>. Stockmarkets also tumbled, with nearly $1 trillion wiped off the value of shares worldwide. Bond markets in troubled southern European countries were also hit. Despite approval earlier this week of a &#8364;110 billion ($145 billion) bail-out of Greece by euro-zone countries and the International Monetary Fund, investors are worried that this will not prove sufficient, and that other European countries, notably Portugal and Spain, will get drawn into the crisis. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Financial reform in America</strong> moved closer. The Senate voted for an amendment that got rid of an upfront $50 billion levy on banks to cover the cost of liquidations, requiring instead that they pay the bill afterwards. A vote on the overall bill is expected shortly.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Mile high club</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>UAL, the parent company of <strong>United Airlines</strong>, and <strong>Continental Airlines</strong> announced that they are to merge in an all-share deal worth around $3 billion. Assuming it gets the go-ahead from competition regulators, the new company, to be called United Continental Holdings, will be the world&#8217;s largest airline by passenger numbers. Consolidation in the aviation industry is being driven by continued losses. Airlines lost a combined total of $9.4 billion in 2009 according to IATA, an industry association. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Flights over Scotland and Ireland were halted as carriers braced themselves for more <strong>disruption from volcanic eruptions</strong> in Iceland. Last month much of Europe&#8217;s airspace was shut down for six days due to ash clouds, stranding many thousands of passengers. Aer Lingus, Ireland&#8217;s national carrier, said it has lost &#8364;20m because of the volcano. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite fears of a sovereign debt contagion, <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>, <strong>UBS </strong>and <strong>Soci\xE9t\xE9 G\xE9n\xE9rale</strong> all reported healthy quarterly profits. BNP&#8217;s profits rose by 47% to &#8364;2.3 billion, while UBS, one of the biggest victims of the crisis, said that it had made a first-quarter profit of SFr2.2 billion ($1.8 billion), compared with a SFr2 billion loss in the same period last year. Another embattled bank, Soci\xE9t\xE9 G\xE9n\xE9rale, made &#8364;1.1 billion, compared with a &#8364;278m loss last year. Both BNP and SocGen also detailed manageable exposures to Greek government debt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Prudential </strong>was forced to delay the details of a rights issue after Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority raised concerns. The issue is meant to raise \xA314 billion ($21 billion) towards a takeover of AIA, an Asian competitor. But reports suggested the regulator was concerned that the deal would overstretch Prudential. Tidjane Thiam, the company&#8217;s chief executive, said that it was still committed to the transaction. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>What&#8217;s mine is yours</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Australian mining companies may have to dig deep after the government announced plans for a new <strong>40% tax on their profits</strong>. Shares in companies such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, both partly Australian-owned, slumped following the news. The country expects to raise A$9 billion ($8.1 billion) each year from the move. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Norsk Hydro</strong>, a Norwegian aluminium producer, has agreed to buy a majority stake in the aluminium operations of <strong>Vale</strong>, a Brazilian mining firm, boosting its production in the country by over 2,000 tons a year. Vale will receive $1.1 billion in cash and a 22% stake in Norsk Hydro in a deal valued at $4.9 billion. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Pearson</strong>, a media company which partly owns <em>The Economist</em>, is to sell its stake in <strong>Interactive Data Corporation</strong> to two private-equity firms in a deal worth $3.4 billion. The publisher plans to focus on its education business.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Manufacturing output</strong> in America grew in April, according to the Institute for Supply Management, in further evidence of a prolonged recovery in the sector. In Britain, a survey by Markit found that manufacturing output and exports are growing at their fastest rate in 15 years. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Good and bad Apple</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite being available only in America, and having been on sale just four weeks, <strong>Apple </strong>sold its millionth iPad. A 3G version of the device, released this week, has already sold 300,000 units. But it wasn&#8217;t all rosy news, as America&#8217;s competition authorities suggested they were preparing to look into whether the firm&#8217;s iPhone software breaks antitrust laws.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

But if the politicians are really as committed to &#8220;cleaning up&#8221; the energy industry as they now claim, far more could be achieved by reducing the subsidies and introducing a carbon tax. That may seem a long way from the calamity in the Gulf; but in the long run those other murky waters also need to be cleaned up. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>But can he govern?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>David Cameron seems set to become prime minister, but not in the way that he hoped</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 7th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BRITAIN has not had a general election quite like this one in living memory. There were shameful scenes at a number of polling stations, as voters tried&#8212;and in some cases failed&#8212;to vote. The results, when they arrived, seemed to follow few discernible patterns. And, as <em>The Economist </em>went to press at breakfast-time on May 7th, the country seemed set to return its first hung parliament since 1974, albeit one in which David Cameron&#8217;s Conservatives had accumulated considerably more votes and seats than Gordon Brown&#8217;s Labour Party.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Since counting was not due to begin in 22 seats until later in the morning, the final result will not be known until the evening of the 7th. But the Tories, although they were heading for a higher percentage of the vote than that which put Labour comfortably in government in 2005, seemed destined to fall short of the 326 parliamentary seats required for an overall majority in the House of Commons. Labour may have polled its lowest share of the popular vote since 1983. But the quirks of the electoral system, and regional variations in the party&#8217;s support&#8212;much stronger in Scotland and the north of England than the south&#8212;mean that its seat tally has not collapsed to the extent that once seemed possible. The biggest surprise of the night was the performance of the Liberal Democrats. After a strong showing by their leader, Nick Clegg, in the television debates that dominated the campaign, a big boost to the Lib Dem seat tally was expected. They held on to some the Tories had hoped to snatch, but lost more than they gained. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet while the new parliament will be hung, in a moral and practical sense the result is plain enough. The election has produced a clear loser: Mr Brown and Labour, who have lost their mandate and many of the votes that put and kept them in power for 13 years. The parliamentary arithmetic seems likely to make it hard for Mr Brown to cobble together a majority with other parties, should he be minded to try. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Britain also has a clear enough winner: Mr Cameron. Speaking at the count in his Witney constituency, he was circumspect, stopping short of claiming victory. But his party, more than any other, has earned the right to govern. The outstanding question is to what extent he will require the support of the Liberal Democrats or, conceivably, another party, such as the Democratic Unionists. That would probably consist of a loose parliamentary pact rather than a formal coalition. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>To the victor, the spoiled</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The instinctive response of many Britons&#8212;and the likely first reaction of financial markets&#8212;will be anxiety and confusion. Britain has only a limited experience of hung parliaments; of the wrangling and protracted period of transition that may now ensue; and of minority government, the probable outcome. The unfamiliar is always disconcerting; the prospect of a weak government is especially alarming now, because of the challenges that will confront the next prime minister. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The biggest of those, which received scandalously little attention during the campaign, is the need to shrink the perilous fiscal deficit. The Tories have promised to hold an emergency budget within 50 days of taking office. Coping with the backlash that is likely&#8212;from taxpayers and, especially, public-sector unions&#8212;would be tough for any government. For an administration boasting only a gossamer mandate it would be harder still. The prospect of serial defeats in Parliament, and thus of another general election in short order, might itself dissuade the Tories from attempting the unpopular measures that Britain&#8217;s dire public finances necessitate.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One option would be a formal coalition with the Lib Dems, with, say, Mr Clegg in the cabinet. Given the arithmetic, Mr Cameron is more likely to try to run a minority government. International experience suggests that this need be neither brief nor toothless. Canada has been run by a minority administration for several years. Sweden was governed by one in the mid-1990s, when it implemented a bold fiscal consolidation. That is partly because, while minority rule is difficult for incumbents, it will also pose problems for the opposition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If all of Mr Cameron&#8217;s opponents were to unite against him over, say, his finance measures or in a confidence motion, they could force another general election. But they would then have to answer to the electorate for their recalcitrance. That is one reason why an arrangement in which the Lib Dems back Mr Cameron over key votes could be in their interests, as well as Mr Cameron&#8217;s and the country&#8217;s. Mr Clegg has previously intimated that, in the event of a hung parliament, a party which secured the most votes and seats would be entitled to try to form a government. Mr Cameron&#8217;s has earned that right. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In other respects, governing as a large minority party might not be much trickier than governing with a small majority, which leaves prime ministers perpetually vulnerable to backbench rebellions. It will require Mr Cameron to cut deals and make compromises. As a natural pragmatist, he may be well suited to this task. A resounding victory eluded him in part because he never quite defined precisely what sort of Conservatism, and what sort of Britain, he was peddling. But, just as revolutionaries often make poor administrators, Mr Cameron&#8217;s flexibility may prove helpful to him in government. Many of his policies&#8212;reforming education, for example, or scrapping ID cards&#8212;overlap with the Lib Dems&#8217;.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Just get on with it</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Lib Dems may well try to extract a concession from Mr Cameron over electoral reform, which they favour. The existing electoral system&#8217;s main recommendation has been its tendency to produce strong governments with clear mandates. This time, it hasn&#8217;t. Mr Cameron and his party have traditionally been hostile to most forms of reform. It may be both wise and politic for them to reconsider.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For now, however, neither Britain nor Mr Cameron has much choice. This is not the mandate he had hoped for: the Tories were once expected to stroll to victory and a comfortable majority. But it is the mandate he has got. With wisdom and a sparing use of legislation, he can still govern effectively if he is canny enough, and his opponents behave responsibly.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Coming to a city near you?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>What has happened in Athens does not have to spread. But the euro zone still faces tough decisions</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF THERE was ever a week to be depressed about the euro, this was it. After an age of dithering, Europe&#8217;s politicians cobble together a colossal rescue package for Greece, worth some &#8364;110 billion ($145 billion), nearly three times the level discussed only three weeks ago&#8212;and behold the results: carnage on the streets of Athens, where three people lost their lives, and no respite in the markets. Not only have yields on short-term Greek bonds soared once again, but other euro members that the plan was supposed to wall off are under pressure, with Portugal and Ireland hit particularly hard. Stockmarkets around the world have slumped as investors fret about the financial stability of a region that makes up almost a quarter of the world economy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Many Europeans fear that they have seen a fragment of their future: contagion spreading from one indebted country to the next, the breakdown of social order as public-sector jobs are cut, years of political indecision and the inevitable ousting (or withdrawal) of countries from the euro. And why not? If a bail-out worth nearly half of Greek GDP fails to command support on the streets of Athens or in the markets, it is tempting to say that the game is up.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Tempting but wrong. Europe faces all sorts of social and political problems, which may or may not manifest themselves, but its current dilemma is rooted in basic economics. From this perspective, neither violence nor jitters in financial markets are proof that the Greek rescue and the Europeans&#8217; broader strategy for dealing with their debt crisis have failed. Lamentably, street riots, even violent ones, are an all-too-frequent part of Greek political life. And financial markets do sometimes react too sceptically to rescue strategies. In February 2009 they slumped when Tim Geithner, America&#8217;s treasury secretary, announced a plan to stress-test banks, fearing his proposals were inadequate for dealing with the banks&#8217; problems. With hindsight, the decision proved a psychological turning-point. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Three reasons to run for the hills</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> So nothing is set. But an awful lot depends on what Europe&#8217;s leaders do now. The new improved Greek rescue has less in common with the Geithner plan than with the first Greek rescue, whose inadequacy started the spiral downwards. There is the same shortage of political courage, not just in Greece and other weak euro-zone members, but also in Germany. And there is the same attempt to paper over contradictions. These need to be dealt with.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Despite its massive price tag, investors are unconvinced by the bail-out strategy for three separate (and hardly irrational) reasons. First, they fret that the promised &#8364;110 billion will not materialise because of continued political opposition in Germany or because the Greeks will not live up to the austerity promises they have made. Second, investors, like German voters, are nervous that, no matter how hard the Greeks try, their country will still be all but bust in three years&#8217; time: the debts are just too big and will have to be rescheduled. Third, and most important, they worry that others, especially Ireland, Portugal and Spain, are in uncomfortably similar boats, facing a future of economic stagnation and spiralling debt. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first worry is exaggerated&#8212;at least in the short term. There seems little doubt that Europe&#8217;s governments will cough up. Even in Germany, parliamentary approval of the rescue package now seems likely. Equally, the Greek government has more chance of passing its wage- and pension-cuts than the street protests might suggest (see ). It has a strong parliamentary majority and surprisingly high poll ratings. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But if you look beyond the next few weeks, the fear that something will go wrong later is all too realistic. The list of reforms that the Greeks have signed up to is brutal: the tax cuts and spending measures are worth some 11% of GDP in three years, and structural reforms, such as freeing up a rigid labour market and busting cartels, may prove even less popular. If sceptical Germans want an excuse to pull the plug on Greece&#8217;s rescue, they will surely find it. And the numbers for Greece are grim: even if one assumes three years of austerity, the country&#8217;s debt burden will have risen to 140% of GDP. Greece will still be perilously close to insolvency. It will surely need more help&#8212;either an open-ended rollover of the official loans or some kind of debt rescheduling. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is the contradiction in the rescue plan. EU governments and the IMF refuse to discuss the possibility of an eventual rescheduling of Greek debt for fear that it would spark uncontrolled contagion. In fact, the logic may increasingly be the opposite. By refusing to admit that Greece faces an obvious solvency problem, whereas Spain, Portugal and Ireland do not, Europe&#8217;s policymakers have made it harder to draw a clear distinction between Greece and the rest. As a result contagion has intensified (see ). </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Change this&#8212;and you change everything</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is the dynamic that must be changed. One priority is more zealous action by Portugal, Spain and others to prove that, although they suffer from some of the same ailments, they are not Greece. Portugal, which has a big deficit and low growth, needs to announce a stronger, bolder fiscal package. Both it and Spain need to speed up competitiveness-enhancing structural reforms, especially freeing up their labour markets. At the same time, the rest of the euro zone must do its part to ensure that this huge internal adjustment succeeds. The ECB must prevent an overall slide into deflation. Germany should cut taxes and do more to boost domestic demand. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Still more urgent, arguably, is a mechanism for supplying the zone&#8217;s weaker economies with cash if panic accelerates. One route would be for them to apply for precautionary funds from the IMF. Euro-zone governments could create inter-governmental credit lines. Or the European Central Bank could step in, buying government bonds in the secondary market. None of these solutions is exactly costless. But any is preferable to the implosion of the euro zone. The nightmare vision of Athens being repeated around the continent should not happen; but averting it will require more bravery and honesty than Europe&#8217;s leaders have shown so far.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Fools rush in</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A bill so bad that it may yet do good</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>YOU might think they would have learned their lesson by now. At the end of 2005 Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill that cracked down on illegal immigration, while doing nothing to regularise the position of the 12m or so people, mostly of Hispanic origin, who were living and working inside the United States without the proper papers, or to create a mechanism for allowing in people from Mexico and other southern neighbours to work with temporary permits. The bill never became law, but its one-sided nature helped stamp the Republicans (92% of whom voted for it in the House) as an anti-immigrant party. In April 2006 Latinos organised a day of protests in more than 100 cities; more than 500,000 people marched in Los Angeles alone. In the 2008 election 67% of Hispanics voted for Barack Obama.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now it is all happening again. Until now, the detection of illegal immigrants has invariably been a matter for the federal authorities. Republican-governed Arizona has just enacted a tough new law of its own: it requires state police to check the papers of anyone whose immigration status they have &#8220;reasonable&#8221; cause to doubt. Opponents say this is sure to lead to racial profiling. The bill is popular with angry white locals, so much so that the previously reform-minded John McCain, who is running for re-election to the Senate in Arizona, has not dared to oppose it. But in a country that is turning Hispanic at a rapid rate (by mid-century white Anglos will be another minority), the Republicans are once again hellbent on being on the wrong side of demography. The backlash will surely last longer than any bump in popularity gained by looking tough. The marches have begun again: on May 1st, up to a million people across the country took to the streets, by no means all of them Hispanic. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> For those who yearn for America to have a sensible immigration policy, the Arizona bill is a reason for both despair and hope. The first is easier to spell out. By any measure, Arizona&#8217;s offering is deeply illiberal. It would require all non-US citizens to carry documents proving their immigration status, and would require police to check those papers in any contact with anyone who might be illegal. The obvious danger is that it would lead to the systematic harassment of brown-skinned people, including legal immigrants. As for illegals, it would simply drive even more of them underground. It would also criminalise anyone who shelters or helps illegals. Even the plan&#8217;s fans acknowledge that this is the toughest such bill ever passed in America.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Make my day</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Paradoxically, the reason for hope is much the same. The bill is such a shocker that it is restarting the national debate. The Arizona law passed largely because the government is failing to do its job. The border is not secure; employers can and do hire people who have no legal right to be in America; and cross-border crime is on the rise. Better enforcement is needed. But on both political and moral grounds, better enforcement can only be part of a comprehensive immigration reform. The 12m illegals cannot be wished away, but must be given a chance to earn their citizenship; a guest-worker programme is needed to match the demands of employers with the desire of Mexicans and others to work. Mr Obama&#8217;s administration has talked a lot about an immigration bill. It is now long past time that they produced one. Otherwise, expect to see more Arizonas. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The charms of Canada</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Good policies, good behaviour and good fortune: if only others could be as lucky</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS THEY contemplate high unemployment, foreclosed homes, shrivelled house prices and the arrogant follies of their investment bankers, Americans may cast envious glances across their northern border. Despite its umbilical links with America, Canada&#8217;s economy suffered only a mild recession and is now well into a solid recovery. The Canadian dollar, having dipped sharply, is back up to rough parity with the greenback. The Bank of Canada has signalled that it may soon raise interest rates. When Stephen Harper, the prime minister, hosts the get-togethers of the G8 and G20 countries next month he will be able to boast to his visitors that his country&#8217;s economy is set to perform better than that of any other rich country this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How has Canada avoided the plagues that are afflicting everyone else? The short answer is a mixture of good policies and good luck (see ). The main reason for the country&#8217;s economic resilience is that neither its financial system nor its housing market magnified the recession. The banks remained in profit. House prices held up fairly well and are now rising. And for that regulators deserve a chunk of the credit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Canada&#8217;s banks face high capital requirements and a cap on their leverage, such that their assets cannot exceed 20 times their capital (a lot less than the corresponding figure for many Wall Street firms and European banks). Canadians who take out mortgages worth more than 80% of the value of the property must also take out insurance against default from a federal agency, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. The banks must insure the rest of their mortgage book with the corporation. It helped, too, that Canada has a single banking regulator. The big five banks snapped up the leading stockbroking firms in the 1990s, becoming universal banks. But, whether through luck or judgment, they never became too dependent on investment banking. And, <em>mirabile dictu</em>, their shareholders managed to ensure that bankers&#8217; bonuses were kept within modest bounds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many of these rules embody lessons learned the hard way from banking collapses in the mid-1980s. Something similar goes for the public finances. By 1995 Canada&#8217;s chronic fiscal deficits, towering public debt and stagnant economy prompted the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> to call it &#8220;an honorary member of the Third World&#8221;. Years of deficit cutting followed. The result was that Mr Harper&#8217;s government could easily afford the modest stimulus it applied in 2008. Government debt in Canada is still below 36% of GDP (and will soon fall), little more than half the (rising) ratio in the United States. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But there is also a large dollop of good fortune behind Canada&#8217;s resilience. If parts of eastern Canada resemble Europe in economic terms, the west looks more like Brazil. Its mines, oil and gas producers and farmers have benefited from the commodity boom brought about by China&#8217;s appetite for raw materials. This boom brings a problem: it is helping to drive up the Canadian dollar, which risks making life more difficult for manufacturers back east. And Canada&#8217;s fiscal health will soon come under strain from the treasured but expensive public health-care system and an ageing population. There is little sign that the country&#8217;s politicians are ready to deal with either.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The costs and benefits of conservative banking</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How much of the Canadian model can, or should, be exported? Critics of the Canadian banks reckon that their conservatism was the flip side of a cosy oligopoly. The big five were barred from merging and partly protected from foreign interlopers. They shared out a profitable domestic market and gave up competing on price. And keeping tabs on the banks is much easier when all are relatively small by international standards and are based within a few hundred yards of each other and of regulators in Toronto.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The result is that Canadians pay more for financial services than others and there is little innovation. Even so, as taxpayers elsewhere dig deep to pay for their bankers&#8217; wheezes they might think that Canadians got a bargain. Replicating Canadian banking elsewhere would be hard. But when Americans and Europeans press Mr Harper at the G20 meeting to accept a tax on banks to curb their riskiness, he has reason to retort that Canadian-style regulation does the job better. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A brilliant idea from the UN</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Why let only one despot endow and name a new prize when so many others deserve acclaim?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>HE IS no cannibal, whatever the scurrilous Western press and exiled opponents say. No court has convicted him, or his family, of pocketing state funds, whatever the American Senate and NGOs allege. And he wins regular elections, as free and fair as many in central Africa. Anyone who doubts his people&#8217;s love need only note the admirable 95% support for him in a presidential poll last November.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So why fret over a decision by UNESCO, the United Nations body responsible for education and science, to launch a prize for achievement in life sciences, paid for by and named after President Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea? Was not Alfred Nobel an arms maker before he became a prize-endower? </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many carp about Mr Nguema&#8217;s regime, perhaps because he snatched power in a coup 30 years ago and vies with Libya&#8217;s Muammar Qaddafi as Africa&#8217;s longest-serving leader. They should instead commend its impressive stability. Foreigners moan about the arrest and murder of opposition leaders, a clampdown on the press, or frittering of oil revenues on palaces and luxury cars. But pragmatists will agree with Mr Nguema that Human Rights Watch and others are clearly out to &#8220;blackmail&#8221; his country. Rumours of horrors in his jails, such as the notorious Black Beach prison, are clearly overblown. A UN special rapporteur who described &#8220;inhuman&#8221; conditions and &#8220;systematic torture&#8221; in Equatorial Guinea&#8217;s prisons was quite reasonably dismissed by Mr Nguema for discussing the issue with the country&#8217;s sole opposition MP.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Observers should focus instead on Mr Nguema&#8217;s generosity. The new UNESCO award is going to set him back some $3m (not including fees for the lobbyists and public-relations firms who swung this for him). Instead of cavilling, other organisations should follow UNESCO&#8217;s approach.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>All shall have prizes</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The World Food Programme, for starters, should ask Zimbabwe&#8217;s president for funds to establish a Robert Mugabe award for agricultural productivity. Next, the UN refugee agency could squeeze a few million dollars from Myanmar&#8217;s junta for a Than Shwe prize for promoting the rights of women prisoners. The World Health Organisation could surely seduce Italy&#8217;s prime minister into providing some cash for a Silvio Berlusconi medal in sex education. The International Atomic Energy Agency might tap Iran for a Mahmoud Ahmadinejad prize for the peaceful sponsorship of nuclear power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The only thing wrong with this proposal is that nobody thought of it earlier. Saddam Hussein could have endowed a prize celebrating multiculturalism. Idi Amin, Uganda&#8217;s great showman president, might have set up an award for innovative culinary science. Many American conservatives are suspicious of the UN; they might feel differently had the former vice-president&#8217;s friends endowed a Dick Cheney transparency-in-government prize. Perhaps UNESCO could next promote sartorial elegance with a Kim Jong Il gong for best-dressed dictator or launch a campaign for brevity in public speaking named after Venezuela&#8217;s president, Hugo Ch\xE1vez.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Setting up such prizes should pose no problem. Getting anybody to accept them may. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h2>Sweden&#8217;s bank tax </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; As Sweden has introduced a fee on banks&#8217; liabilities we would like to address a few of your concerns about the IMF&#8217;s work on a bank tax (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). In Sweden we have combined the levy with a resolution fund used to reduce government debt. This gives the government economic and political room for manoeuvre if it becomes necessary to intervene. Importantly, we have introduced a tough resolution framework to combat moral hazard, a lesson from our own financial crisis in the 1990s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Based upon our principles, a bank&#8217;s shareholders, subordinated debtholders, and management cannot expect to be rescued by taxpayers. It is essential that any international agreement on a fee contains these elements, which ought to be complemented by other types of regulation. It is true that some countries&#8217; banking systems have been largely unaffected by the crisis. However, this does not mean that they will be spared in the next crisis and that the fatal logic of &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; does not apply to their financial system. Today&#8217;s luck is not a good reason for being complacent.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>Cyprus </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Allow me a few observations on your article about the new leader of the Turkish Cypriots (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). Cyprus, including its occupied areas, acceded to the European Union after long and painful negotiations, having fulfilled all relevant conditions. Accepting any plan for a settlement was never a prerequisite. Due to the Turkish occupation the EU <em>acquis</em> was suspended in those areas over which the government does not exercise effective control. This suspension has a temporary geographical character. Anyone who knows how the EU operates will realise that the &#8220;Direct Trade Regulation&#8221; is legally flawed (the opinion of the Legal Service of the EU Council) and politically unacceptable, as it treats the occupied areas as a third country.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>My government has consistently supported the economic development of the Turkish- Cypriots, provided that it takes place within the framework of international, domestic and European legality, without infringing on the sovereign rights of the republic. The implementation of the Green Line and the Financial Regulations, despite all obstacles raised by the Turkish-Cypriot regime, are examples. The government of Cyprus has always treated Turkish-Cypriots as rightful, equal and full citizens, giving them access to all public services despite the fact that Turkish-Cypriots do not pay taxes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>I must also remind you that Cyprus has supported Turkey&#8217;s accession bid, although this country occupies militarily more than one-third of our territory, does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus and refuses to fulfil and comply with its obligations vis-\xE0-vis the EU undertaken in 2005. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Emerging markets </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Your special report failed to discuss the drawbacks of operating in emerging markets (&#8220;&#8221;, April 17th). I have many friends working in Indian IT firms. From what I hear, the industry treats its employees in the same way as the British Raj treated its Indian tea plantation workers: little regard is given to well-being, overtime is unpaid and employees are badly treated to satisfy foreign clients. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Let us do a simple thought experiment. Let X denote the number of Indians working in Indian IT companies who want to move to similar firms in the United States. Let Y denote the number of Americans working in American IT companies who want to move to similar firms in India. It should be obvious that X is much greater than Y, even after normalising for the two different populations. I will believe that emerging markets have resulted in a world turned upside down when the ratio of X to Y approaches and then exceeds one.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ashok Ramasubramanian<br>Schenectady, New York</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; The 2009 Pew Global Attitudes Project&#8217;s discovery that 94% of Indians are satisfied with their lives is so much easier to digest than the Indian Planning Commission&#8217;s findings that 30% of Indians (400m people) are living below the poverty line of $10 per month per family. Now I can go back to my ivory tower with a more placated conscience.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Stanley Pinto<br>Bangalore </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; I have just one small gripe with your report on innovation in emerging markets. Your title is a touch Western-centric. After all, if you were from China or India or Brazil you might think that the world is now the right way up.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Morice Mendoza<br>Cambridge, England </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; What do South Korea&#8217;s Samsung, India&#8217;s Mittal, and Russia&#8217;s Gazprom have in common? Or Mexico&#8217;s CEMEX, Brazil&#8217;s Aracruz, and China&#8217;s Sinochem? Or Russia&#8217;s Evraz, Taiwan&#8217;s Acer, and India&#8217;s Tata? They are all considered to be global giants from so-called emerging markets. As you say, perhaps the very phrase may end up blinding people to the fact that many of these markets have &#8220;already emerged&#8221;. The term is out of date, of course. And so is your concern about American and European protectionism. Large as these markets still are, those that have recently emerged are large enough already to sideline protectionism from the so-called west. If protectionism is a challenge, it is from the erstwhile emerging markets themselves. Emerging protectionism, to coin a phrase.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>The Arabic language</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; Having spent several years working with youth in the Arab world, I took great interest in your article on the tension between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), dialectical Arabic and foreign languages in the public sphere (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). You correctly point out that Arab students often study in English or French, rather than in Arabic. While this phenomenon was previously limited to elites, foreign-language education is increasingly popular among the middle classes as well. Yet your article missed another much more significant point: schooling in a foreign language does not imply fluency in a foreign language, especially as &#8220;American&#8221;, &#8220;British&#8221; or &#8220;French&#8221; schools and universities with poorly trained teachers proliferate across the region. As such, thousands of students leave high school and university each year with only passive knowledge of both their mother and adoptive tongues, unable to read or to write well in either.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>White elephant </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; You suggest that the Belo Monte dam proposed on Brazil&#8217;s Xingu river may be a white elephant (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). In fact it may be the first of many to march upstream. Here&#8217;s why. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As you say, the government is pouring in subsidies to make the project an attractive proposition in the face of the 83 reais ($47) per megawatt-hour rate cap. Between income-tax breaks and low-cost public financing, each Brazilian will chip in around 67 reais ($38) to the project and then pay for the electricity. But that is unlikely to be enough. In a 2006 study we estimated that cost overruns and delays would reduce the project&#8217;s probability of economic feasibility to around 35% at best.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Feasible or not, dry-season water shortfalls will cost $11 billion-19 billion (present value) in revenues over the long-term. The solution is big upstream storage dams that would provide water all year round and make Belo Monte&#8217;s reservoir look like a small pond. Proposed in the 1980s, the first of these would affect many more indigenous people and 30 times as much forest as Belo Monte. For now, a 2008 resolution of the National Energy Policy Council would forestall the dam but that can be undone. Today&#8217;s energy-environment tussle over the Xingu is a mild warm-up for a larger dilemma that requires open, informed debate.</p>\r\n\

    <p>SIR &#8211; In addition to his previous environmental efforts regarding the Belo Monte dam, James Cameron might consider this. Some of the Xingu locals could live in his 768-square-metre Malibu cottage (electricity included) while he lives in their cottage (electricity TBA). A month should suffice.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>Global effects</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; In your leader on the Icelandic volcanic explosion you erroneously argue that global effects only arise from global, or presumably ubiquitous, causes (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). Many global effects arise from less than global causes: such as climate change, which will be experienced by nearly all, yet is caused by far fewer, or the loss of biodiversity. Moreover, localised causes can have second order global effects, when significant effects ripple through a globalised world, such as financial crises. When Larry Summers was president of Harvard University he said that the challenge for educators was to train students to think systematically about long causal chains. Think locally, experience globally; yet also think globally and experience locally.</p>\r\n\

Having first grasped its shadowy form as a noun from Anita Brookner some years ago, I have used it in my writings ever since, partly to teach uppity clients a thing or two.

    <h1>Invisible and heavy shackles</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Until China breaks down the barriers between town and countryside, it cannot unleash the buying power of its people&#8212;or keep its economy booming</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | CHONGQING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ON THE hilly streets of Chongqing, men with thick bamboo poles loiter for customers who will pay them to carry loads. The &#8220;stick men&#8221;, as they are called, hang the items from either end of the poles and heave them up over their shoulders. In a city where the Communist Party chief, Bo Xilai, likes to sing old revolutionary songs, these workers should be hymned as heroes. Yet few of them are even classed as citizens of the city where they live. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most of the stick men were born in the countryside around Chongqing. (The name covers both the urban centre that served as China&#8217;s capital in the second world war, and a hinterland, the size of Scotland, which the city administers.) Since 1953, shortly after the Communists came to power, Chinese citizens have been divided into two strata, urban and rural, not according to where they live but on a hereditary basis. The stick men may have spent all their working lives on the streets of Chongqing, but their household registration papers call them &#8220;agricultural&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The registration system (<em>hukou</em>, in Chinese) was originally intended to stop rural migrants flowing into the cities. Stick men were among the targets. In the early days of Communist rule in Chongqing the authorities rounded up thousands of &#8220;vagrants&#8221; and sent them to camps (vagrants, said Mao Zedong, &#8220;lack constructive qualities&#8221;). There they endured forced labour before being packed back to their villages. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Rapid industrial growth over the past three decades has required tearing down migration barriers to exploit the countryside&#8217;s huge labour surplus. <em>Hukou</em>, however, still counts for a lot, from access to education, health care and housing to compensation payouts. To be classified as a peasant often means being treated as a second-class citizen. Officials in recent years have frequently talked about &#8220;reforming&#8221; the system. They have made it easier to acquire urban citizenship, in smaller cities at least. But since late last year the official rhetoric has become more urgent. Policymakers have begun to worry that the country&#8217;s massive stimulus spending in response to the global financial crisis could run out of steam. <em>Hukou</em> reform, they believe, could boost rural-urban migration and with it the consumer spending China needs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In early March 11 Chinese newspapers (it would have been 13, had not two bottled out) defied party strictures and teamed together to publish an extraordinary joint editorial. It called on China&#8217;s parliament, the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC), which was then about to hold its annual meeting, to urge the government to scrap the <em>hukou</em> system as soon as possible. &#8220;We hope&#8221;, it said, &#8220;that a bad policy we have suffered for decades will end with our generation, and allow the next generation to truly enjoy the sacred rights of freedom, democracy and equality bestowed by the constitution.&#8221; Not since the Tiananmen uprising in 1989 had so many newspapers simultaneously cast aside the restraints imposed by the Communist Party&#8217;s mighty Propaganda Department, which micromanages China&#8217;s media output. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The editorial said that &#8220;gratifying&#8221; progress had already been made with reform, but the system&#8217;s &#8220;invisible and heavy shackles&#8221; were still causing distress. Reform could inject &#8220;more dynamism&#8221; into the economy and help counter the effects of an ageing population. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Party leaders resented the newspapers&#8217; boldness. Zhang Hong, a deputy chief editor of the <em>Economic Observer</em>, a weekly newspaper, was stripped of his title (though allowed to keep working) for his role in organising the editorial. Within a couple of hours of its appearance on newspaper websites, the authorities ordered its removal. <em>Hukou</em> reform was fine, but the government did not want to be hassled. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Urban citizens benefit from the <em>hukou</em> system, but those who migrate between cities are also irked by it. In 2003 some Chinese newspapers, independently of one another, pressed for reform after a college-educated migrant was detained by police for failing to produce a required identity document, and was beaten to death. The outcry led to the scrapping of regulations that allowed the police to detain people and deport them to their home towns for similar misdemeanours. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This time, says an editor involved in the <em>hukou</em> editorial, the impact was the opposite. Among many of the party-picked delegates to the NPC, he says, <em>hukou</em> reform became &#8220;a taboo topic&#8221;. The prime minister, Wen Jiabao, told the session in March that the government would carry out reforms and repeated that requirements would be relaxed in towns and smaller cities. But he offered few details. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The complexity of <em>hukou </em>reform daunts Chinese leaders. It would have a huge impact on crucial aspects of the economy, from the system of land ownership in the countryside to the financing of public services. But the downsides of an unreformed system are much more obvious. The influx of migrants has caught local governments badly unprepared. Budget pressures have made them highly reluctant to spend money on helping the incomers. Registered urban residents are none too keen either. Few want their children sharing classes with kids they regard as country bumpkins. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>In a cold classroom</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In urban and rural China alike, the first nine years of schooling are supposed to be free. But not for rural migrants. In Beijing, as in other big cities, hundreds of privately run schools have sprung up in recent years to cater for them. At the Xiangyang Hope School in Huangcun township on the southern edge of the capital, the basic fee is 1,100 yuan ($165) a year: a snip for many urban residents, but the equivalent of several weeks&#8217; wages for many migrants. There is an extra charge for heating; children complain that they are cold in the bitter winters. One parent says she is preparing to take her child back to her village, because conditions are better there. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The authorities have tried to muzzle the principal, Luo Chao (a migrant himself). Mr Luo was until recently the headmaster of another school to the north-east of Beijing. He says local officials told him just before the lunar new year holiday in February that the school would be demolished to make way for a private development project, and could not reopen after the break. Officials briefly detained Mr Luo and the head teacher of another condemned migrants&#8217; school to prevent them petitioning higher authorities. Officials promised that the children would be found new places, but Mr Luo says there is no way that the local government-run school would have enough room for them. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In education, the <em>hukou</em> system&#8217;s absurdity is particularly glaring. Migrant children, though classified as &#8220;agricultural&#8221;, usually have no more than one brief exposure to rural life every year when they are taken to their parents&#8217; home towns for the lunar new year festivities. School places in urban areas are so scarce that some pupils will drop out and others, though old enough for secondary school, will have to stay in primary classes. Tens of millions of children of migrant workers are, in effect, forced to stay in the countryside for schooling, looked after by other relatives. If they do move to urban areas with their parents, they may not sit exams for senior high school in the city where they live. They must return to their place of registration. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Until the late 1990s, a child&#8217;s <em>hukou</em> could only follow its mother&#8217;s. This meant that even a child who grew up in Beijing with a father registered as a Beijing citizen might have to travel hundreds of miles to sit the exam in his mother&#8217;s registered home town. <em>Hukou</em> can still affect a student&#8217;s chances of getting into top universities, for which each province has a quota of places. The quotas for provincial-level cities like Beijing and Shanghai are disproportionately large. Such privileges fuel a lively black market in highly priced <em>hukous</em> of favoured cities. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The relaxation of <em>hukou</em> rules in recent years has been half-hearted. Chongqing last year offered urban <em>hukou</em> to any rural resident who had graduated from senior high school and who was prepared to give up his entitlement to farm a plot of land and own a village homestead. Those are big provisos. Shanghai announced with fanfare last year that seven years&#8217; work in the city&#8212;along with the required tax and social-security payments&#8212;would entitle a resident to <em>hukou.</em> But rural migrants often work without contracts and do not pay tax or contribute to welfare funds; only 3,000 of Shanghai&#8217;s millions of migrant workers would qualify, said Chinese press reports. On May 1st Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province and a magnet for migrants, began phasing out the &#8220;agricultural&#8221; distinction in its <em>hukou</em> documents, but the effect of this is mostly cosmetic. Beijing has been among the slowest to change. One Shanghai urban <em>hukou</em>-holder who has lived in Beijing for well over a decade says he still cannot get registered there. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Moving with the moon</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The stick men of Chongqing are certainly not impressed. Several, when asked, said they had no desire to acquire urban <em>hukou</em>, even if it were offered. Their indifference poses a problem. In 2007 Chongqing municipality (the city plus its vast hinterland) and the city of Chengdu, 340km (210 miles) to the north-west in Sichuan Province, were chosen by the central government to pioneer reforms aimed at rebalancing urban and rural development. This would involve turning migrants into genuine urban citizens and exploiting the untapped value of the land left behind. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This was long overdue. For all the hoopla created by the massive city-bound migration of rural residents in the past two decades (the biggest such shift in human history, with 150m moving so far and another 300m predicted to do so in the next 20-30 years), China has failed to reap the full benefits of this rapid urbanisation. Anyone who tries to travel in China around the lunar new year holiday will have an inkling of the problem. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Because they still have rights to a rural homestead and to farm a plot of land, many rural <em>hukou</em>-holders maintain a vital link with the countryside even after they move. Come the new year, millions rush back to their villages to celebrate with elderly relatives and children left behind on the farm. A recent survey by Renmin University in Beijing found that about a third of migrants in their 20s aspired to build a house in their home village rather than buy one in a city. Only 7% of them identified themselves as city people. Another survey recently quoted in a party journal said that nearly 30% of migrants planned eventually to return to their villages. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chongqing&#8217;s stick men say there are other good reasons for preserving the status quo. China&#8217;s one-child policy is more relaxed in the countryside, where two-child families are common. Rural health care is rudimentary, but a scheme introduced in recent years provides subsidised treatment for rural <em>hukou-</em>holders who make a small annual contribution (cheaper than urban insurance). The stick men have to return to their villages for it, but, in common with around half of China&#8217;s migrants, they work in the province of their <em>hukou</em>, and the journey is feasible. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The poor integration of China&#8217;s rural migrants into city life has big implications for the economy. In the largest cities, where property prices are soaring, few could even dream of getting on to the housing ladder. In smaller urban areas they would stand a better chance, but since they cannot sell the land they farm or even their own houses, many cannot afford it. In effect, their rural land entitlements lock up what could be a huge new source of spending power. They also prevent the consolidation of tiny plots into more efficient farms. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chongqing, whose leader, Mr Bo, is widely expected to be a star of the new generation of leaders due to take over in 2012, has gone for easy solutions first. In late 2008 it set up a &#8220;country land exchange institute&#8221; on the fourth floor of a new office building in the city centre. Dong Jianguo, its president (and a senior Chongqing land official), describes this as something like a market for trading carbon emissions. By cutting the amount of land used for building homes or factories and converting it into new farmland, villages can gain credits known as <em>dipiao</em>, or land tickets. These can then be sold to urban developers who want to build on other patches of farmland, usually far away on the city periphery. The aim is to ensure no net loss of tillable fields. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chongqing is not the only place trying this out, but it is doing so on a provincial scale. Eleven auctions held so far at the exchange have raised nearly 1.9 billion yuan for <em>dipiao</em> equivalent to 1,200 hectares (2,970 acres) of farmland. The money has been spent on repaying villages for the cost of creating new farmland, compensating those who do not want to stay and building new, more condensed housing for those who do. Stephen Green of Standard Chartered Bank said in a recent report that the scheme, while falling well short of fundamental reform, had enabled some of the wealth created by the urban land market to trickle down to the countryside. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Two huge constraints impede the government&#8217;s efforts to liberate the countryside&#8217;s economic potential. The first is confusion over land-ownership. Unlike urban land, which is state-owned but freely traded, rural land is defined as &#8220;collectively&#8221; owned. It has never been made entirely clear whether officials, or peasants, control collective rights. Officials fear that giving peasants a right to trade their homes and farmland would cut the ties that bind rural <em>hukou</em>-holders to the countryside and lead to the creation of Mumbai-like slums. They sneer at India for its urban squalor. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chinese scholars are bitterly divided over how to proceed. Opponents of rural land reform say the global financial crisis has proved their point: millions of migrant workers in the cities lost their jobs as export industries slumped, but because they had land to go back to there was no major unrest. In Chongqing, officials at the <em>dipiao</em> trading centre are nervous that any adverse publicity even about their cautious experiment might fuel a backlash. This would complicate their tentative plans for something more adventurous: trial runs of mortgaging rural homesteads. The possible impact of foreclosures on rural stability is the conservatives&#8217; worst nightmare. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Mouths to feed</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The other constraint is the Chinese government&#8217;s deep-rooted fear that domestically produced grain may be insufficient to feed the country. It has decreed that a minimum of 120m hectares of arable land be preserved for this, a &#8220;red line&#8221; that officials say is already close to being crossed. Some Chinese experts argue that the line is arbitrary, that efficiencies of scale could considerably boost output and that China could rely more on the global grain market to supplement its needs. But memories of a famine from 1959 to 1961 that killed millions of people, and a fear that relying on imports could threaten China&#8217;s security, make officials adamant that the line must not be breached. This means that even if land trading were to be liberalised, many peasants (or migrants with rural <em>hukou</em>) still could not cash in fully. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Pu Yongjian of Chongqing University laments that the central government has failed to give the municipality enough leeway to experiment. He says that in 2007, when Chongqing was instructed to carry out trial reforms, it expected to enjoy freedoms similar to those bestowed on the city of Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong, in the 1980s and 90s. Shenzhen was even able to set up a stockmarket, though party conservatives scorned it. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got that kind of power, so what&#8217;s the point of calling it an experimental zone?&#8221; asks Mr Pu. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The groundwork, at least, for more radical change is at last being laid. A nationwide push has begun to issue rural households with certificates stating what land they farm and what residential property they occupy. These, potentially, could be used as proof of ownership should the government eventually decide to encourage a rural property market. The government said in December that it wanted the task to be completed within three years. It will be tough work, hampered by decades of haziness over where boundaries lie. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Chongqing municipality, having got an early start, hopes to finish handing out its certificates next year. But in rural Chongqing, change still seems slow. The village of Shuangxi in the hills north-east of Chongqing city has been designated by local officials as a reform trailblazer. Its peasants were encouraged to give up their land-use rights to a dairy company, which used the fields to produce fodder. All but a dozen households agreed, in return for a share of the rent paid by the company. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Li Longhui, Shuangxi&#8217;s party chief, wants to go further. By persuading the farmers to move from their freestanding homes into new three-storey apartment blocks, the village has recovered 33 hectares of land (10% of its total area). Ms Li would like to trade this on the <em>dipiao </em>market, but complains that the price is still too low. So far the local government has borne the cost of Shuangxi&#8217;s housing upgrade, its new school and the recreation area where elderly villagers dance to revolutionary songs. Recouping the money, says Ms Li, would mean selling village land for industrial use. That is still heretical.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The backlash begins</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A new state law has galvanised Latinos nationwide, and others too</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | LOS ANGELES | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ANTONIO GONZALEZ is, ironically enough, delighted with Arizona&#8217;s new law against illegal immigration. He is president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project (SVREP), which works to mobilise American Latinos as a political force. Its motto is <em>su voto es su voz</em>, your vote is your voice. The Latino movement usually grows by spurts in response to xenophobic overreactions by conservative America, and the Arizona law may be the biggest overreaction yet, according to Mr Gonzalez. It has &#8220;done more to organise our community than we could have done&#8221; and made it &#8220;the most vibrant social movement in America today, 100 times larger than the tea-party movement.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Arizona&#8217;s law, signed on April 23rd, makes illegal immigration a state misdemeanour in addition to a federal civil violation. It also requires local police, after making a &#8220;lawful contact&#8221;, to check the immigration status of people who cause &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221;, and to arrest them if they lack documents. To Mr Gonzalez the phrases &#8220;lawful contact&#8221; and &#8220;reasonable suspicion&#8221; allow cops selectively to pull over Hispanic-looking drivers like him on the pretext of a scratched windscreen or other trifle. The deputies of Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the state capital, are already notorious for doing this sort of thing, and the law would require cops to do it statewide. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And so a backlash has begun. Last weekend demonstrators protested in cities across the country, wearing T-shirts that said <em>Todos somos Arizona</em>, we are all Arizona. Liberal places such as San Francisco have threatened to boycott the state, and private companies have cancelled conferences there. Even Major League Baseball is considering relocating its 2011 All-Star Game, the first ever slated to be played in the state. To Arizona&#8217;s conservative machos, this one hurts&#8212;especially since it recalls the National Football League&#8217;s decision in 1991 to move the 1993 Super Bowl to punish Arizona for not making the birthday of Martin Luther King a holiday. (Arizonans then swiftly voted for MLK day.) </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the 1990s a similar backlash occurred in response to a Californian law, Proposition 187, approved by ballot in 1994 but blocked by the courts before it could go into effect. Supported by Pete Wilson, the Republican governor at the time, its objective was to keep illegal immigrants, most of whom were and are Hispanic, from using public services such as education and health care, and like the Arizona law, it required police to check up on suspects&#8217; immigration status. Instead, 187 galvanised Latinos, who registered to vote in record numbers and changed the politics of California permanently. Even Republicans now fear alienating them.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Latinos in other states, notably Texas, have also become more politically assertive. But those in Arizona appeared to be different until now. Many have been American for several generations, barely speak Spanish and are themselves ambivalent about the illegal immigrants coming through the Sonoran desert from Mexico, many of whom smuggle drugs or commit crimes. Just last week, there was another manhunt in the desert for illegal immigrants who had shot a sheriff&#8217;s deputy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But it now turns out that Arizonan Latinos are not different at all, says Arturo Vargas of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), another Hispanic lobby. He worries that they are as reluctant as Latinos in California, Florida, Texas and New York to participate in this year&#8217;s census because many of them fear that the information will be passed to immigration officials. This means that the population in these states could be undercounted, and the Arizona law has made that risk greater by increasing the disquiet. Simultaneously, though, Mr Vargas is encouraged to note that the law seems to have turned nearly every Latino citizen in Arizona into a lifelong voter.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But what does such mobilisation mean for America&#8217;s politics? William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, DC, think-tank, believes that Arizona may be a bellwether for the whole country in more ways than one. Over the past two decades Arizona&#8217;s Latino population of children and young adults has grown so fast that the state now has what he calls the largest &#8220;cultural generation gap&#8221; in the country: 83% of Arizona&#8217;s older people are white, but only 43% of its children now are. States like Nevada, California, Texas, New Mexico and Florida have gaps almost as large.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As a result, says Mr Frey, old white voters increasingly balk at paying taxes so that people they consider alien can go to school or the emergency room. The result, he thinks, is populist anger rather akin to that now fuelling the tea-party movement, which draws much of its support from white male baby-boomers. It is possible, says Mr Frey, that in Arizona the seeds of new racial and ethnic competition for public resources have been planted.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Polls seem to bear this out. One, by the <em>New York Times</em>/CBS News, suggests that 82% of Americans consider it either very or somewhat likely that the Arizona law would lead to people of certain racial groups being singled out. Yet slightly more than half of Americans also think that the law is about right, and another 9% think it &#8220;doesn&#8217;t go far enough&#8221;. Our own YouGov poll (see chart) shows large majorities in favour of a range of enforcement measures. Within Arizona, people like Sheriff Arpaio, who has been re-elected four times, have soaring approval ratings. Mr Arpaio even thinks he could be elected governor (although he decided this week to content himself with remaining sheriff). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So instead of just one mobilisation, by Latinos, there may be two or more. And they could clash, pitting the old and white against the young and brown. Mr Gonzalez is sanguine about this risk. The marches of the past week have shown that many whites, blacks and Asians stand with Latinos in demanding more humane federal immigration policies. &#8220;Every American who doesn&#8217;t want to see an apartheid Jim Crow society return will come to our side,&#8221; he predicts. Yet the other side produced protesters too, wearing T-shirts that said &#8220;Remember the Alamo&#8221;. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The Times Square scare</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A failed bomb attempt reveals both strengths and weaknesses</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;I &#9829; New York&#8221; T-shirts are back on sale for $2.99, just steps away from where Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-born American citizen, allegedly attempted to detonate an improvised bomb inside a car in the heart of Times Square on May 1st. On discovery of the smoking vehicle New York&#8217;s police (NYPD) quickly evacuated the area. In a New York minute, Times Square bounced back. Soon after the bomb squad had defused the device, traffic returned and throngs of people again filled its sidewalks and packed into its shops and theatres. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Just over 53 hours after the smoking SUV was discovered, Mr Shahzad was arrested at Kennedy airport as he tried to leave the country on a flight to Dubai. Ray Kelly, New York&#8217;s police commissioner, compared the speedy arrest to the work of Jack Bauer, a fictional counter-terrorism agent who repeatedly saves the world in 24 hours. But the fact that Mr Shahzad nearly got away (the plane had closed its doors before it was stopped, because the authorities had earlier lost track of their suspect) is embarrassing, to say the least. And it was not expensive technology or highly-sensitive intelligence that alerted authorities to the SUV on Saturday night. Street vendors, ordinary New Yorkers, did that.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> That said, the NYPD has upped its game since the 2001 attacks. It has increased the number of detectives on its joint task-force with the FBI from 17 to 120. It has hired David Cohen, a former senior CIA spook, to head its counter-terrorism outfit. It has posted detectives to Abu Dhabi, Amman, London and elsewhere. It has hired native speakers of Arabic, Dari, Persian, Urdu, Pushtun and Bengali. Since 2001 New York has been the focus of at least 11 foiled plots, which included plans to blow up the Brooklyn Bridge and the world&#8217;s most famous stock exchange.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The really alarming thing about the Times Square bomb, of course, is that it may have been an inside job. Mr Shahzad seemed to be living the American dream. He came to America as a student, eventually earning his MBA. He married, had two children, worked as a financial analyst and owned a house in suburban Connecticut. Yet, according to the authorities, he recently received bomb-making training in Waziristan, probably from the Pakistani Taliban. Fortunately, he seems to have been a poor student in that subject.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Shahzad, if guilty, would be part of a deeply disturbing trend. Last autumn Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan who grew up in New York, was arrested for plotting to blow up the subway. Last November a Muslim army major killed 12 people in a shooting-spree in Texas. A third of all charged terror suspects have been American citizens. Home-grown terrorists obviously face fewer travel restrictions and, being more familiar with America, are better able to steer clear of intelligence officers. Mr Shahzad was not apparently on anyone&#8217;s radar until the weekend.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Terrorism is also causing tension between Washington and New York. Mr Obama&#8217;s attorney-general, Eric Holder, is still considering a Manhattan federal court for the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged architect of the 2001 attacks. Opposition from New Yorkers is making this a tricky issue for the White House. Other places have been suggested, such as West Point, a military academy north of the city; no announcement has been made yet. And despite the 2001 attacks, New York has always found it hard to get money from pork-loving Congress for security. Michael Bloomberg, New York&#8217;s mayor, headed to Washington on May 5th for a security briefing. He is hoping to use this incident to get more funding for his city.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In particular, Mr Bloomberg wants money to expand his Lower Manhattan Security Initiative to midtown (including Times Square). The plan involves an extensive network of cameras, licence-plate readers and weapon-detectors. The NYPD currently operates 82 cameras in Times Square, but that was plainly not enough. Mr Kelly warned that &#8220;in the eyes of terrorists, New York is America.&#8221; And next time it may not be so lucky. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>As jobs fade away</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The Obama administration tries to reassure some very angry people</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>OVER the past year Vice-President Joe Biden has been barnstorming around America. As head of Barack Obama&#8217;s Middle-Class Task-Force, he has stumped for administration policy, attempting to sell the doings of Washington, dc, to the average voter. It&#8217;s a tricky job. Americans were keenly aware of growing inequality even before the recession; in 2007, the top 1% of earners took home 23.5% of all income earned, the highest share since 1928. Since the crisis, they have been incensed, and frustrated, by the return of good times to Wall Street while Main Street languishes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Stratospheric salaries in the financial sector are a meaty target, but middle-class weakness has more to do with deeper economic shifts. In recent decades the American economy has become increasingly polarised. Jobs have been plentiful for low and high-skilled workers, but employment opportunities for middle-skilled labourers have become much scarcer. While the Great Recession dealt a blow to Wall Street oligarchs, it greatly accelerated the withering of the broad middle. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> At a recent task-force forum at the University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin, Mr Biden struck a populist tone while rallying the audience behind more financial regulation. &#8220;The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary,&#8221; he noted. And, he added, on Wall Street. But the task-force has the difficult job of reconciling public anger at the very rich with the troubles of the middle class. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Technology is the main culprit. Automation and outsourcing have claimed whole classes of jobs. Among them are routine but vital tasks that were labour-intensive before the computing revolution: manufacturing and number-crunching jobs that used to pay handsomely. The economy now needs workers to do what can&#8217;t be done by machines or call-centres in Bangalore, which leaves iPad design and caretaker work but not enough in between. The supply of skilled workers has failed to keep pace with demand, so the college wage premium (see chart) has increased. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The administration has gestured towards creating better jobs. Mr Biden&#8217;s task-force has produced a slew of reports on the importance of green jobs, but the energy legislation that might change business incentives is paralysed, and Mr Obama is not doing much to push for it. More practical incentives would help: better child care would enhance women&#8217;s earning power, and student-loan reforms, as contained in the health-care bill, should make college more affordable. The task-force maintains touching faith in unions. In April Mr Biden&#8217;s chief economic adviser commended Mr Obama&#8217;s decision to endorse &#8220;pre-hire collective-bargaining agreements&#8221;, ad hoc union agreements that cover individual projects, for government contracts. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But as David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, points out in a new paper on labour market polarisation, fading union power has been more the effect than the cause of occupational shifts. Middle-skill jobs have declined as a share of occupations across Europe as well, and inequality has increased, though not as much as in America. America&#8217;s labour market may be unique in the extent of its middle-class troubles, but not in their existence. How to maintain a stable middle class amid sweeping technological change is a problem the developed world is only beginning to appreciate. Governments will be sorely tempted to protect workers, but a flexible, well-educated labour force is likely to fare best in the transition. That message is less politically galvanising than bank-bashing. But the vice-president should embrace it. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The sensible insurrection</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Pragmatic, Midwestern conservatives may help Republicans in the Senate</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | INDIANAPOLIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ON THE eve of Indiana&#8217;s primary on May 4th, Michiana 9/12, a tea-party group, gathered in Elkhart. Of all the races the next day, none was more important than the five-man Republican Senate primary. Evan Bayh, Indiana&#8217;s Democratic senator, is retiring; Republicans are keen to seize his seat. In Elkhart members of Michiana 9/12 said that the Republican nominee should be a &#8220;pit bull&#8221;. They prayed that God&#8217;s will would be done the next day.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indiana&#8217;s election, along with those in Ohio and North Carolina on the same day, were among the first in the series of primaries that will set the scene for November&#8217;s mid-terms. Many tea-partiers hope to anoint ideological Republican nominees. In some states, such as Florida, where they have already driven the moderate Charlie Crist out of the party, they will succeed. In Indiana, however, the more conservative candidates lost to Dan Coats, who previously held the Senate seat between 1989 and 1999. On May 5th Mr Coats began campaigning against Brad Ellsworth, a Blue Dog congressman and the Democratic candidate for Senate. Populist fervour is real enough. But Mr Coats is one of handful of Midwestern Republicans who represent a different insurrection. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Coats is the opposite of an anti-establishment conservative. He is quite a dull speaker. He served as a congressman, senator and ambassador before becoming a lobbyist. In the primary he faced a crowded field of challengers. Chief among them was Marlin Stutzman, a young state senator and self-proclaimed &#8220;original 9/12er&#8221; (an anti-tax movement launched by Glenn Beck of Fox News). Mr Stutzman won three straw polls of tea-partiers, and the hearts of Michiana 9/12. He was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, Indiana Right-to-Life, Mike Huckabee and Jim DeMint, a rabble-rousing senator from South Carolina. Yet Mr Coats comfortably managed to fend off Mr Stutzman by 40% to 30%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Coats&#8217;s familiar name and establishment support surely helped. But he also has the advantage of fitting into an old Midwestern mould: conservative yet pragmatic, according to Bill Frenzel, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota now at the Brookings Institution. Hoosiers have a history of favouring practical Republicans, such as the governor, Mitch Daniels, who some now consider presidential material, and an independent-minded senator, Richard Lugar. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Indiana and other Midwestern states, 2010 may see not the death but the revival of pragmatic conservatives. North Dakota&#8217;s conciliatory governor, John Hoeven, looks sure to win the Senate seat vacated by Byron Dorgan, a Democrat. In Illinois Mark Kirk, a particularly moderate congressman, easily won the Senate nomination despite the tea party&#8217;s disdain for him. He may well nab Barack Obama&#8217;s old Senate seat in November. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As for the bellwether of Ohio, the Republican Senate nominee is Rob Portman, the budget director and trade representative for George Bush junior. Admired as a business-minded, mainstream conservative, Mr Portman faced no challenge for the nomination. (A car-dealer sought to attract tea partiers in a bid against him but, after little progress, switched to a House race.) Republicans will surely nominate some fire-breathing ideologues. But these may be the least of the Democrats&#8217; worries. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>After Murtha</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A tough special election in Democratic territory</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | JOHNSTOWN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF YOU require a monument to the late congressman John Murtha, just look around Johnstown in western Pennsylvania. It&#8217;s easy to get here, thanks to the lavishly subsidised but little-trafficked John Murtha airport. If you are depressed by the pretty but rundown town centre, where there are many closed businesses and fading shopfronts, raise your spirits by touring the busy industrial zone or the quarters of defence contractors such as Northrop Grumman that have set themselves up in this rusting former steel town. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A visiting Martian might wonder just what attracted high-tech firms such as these to this remote, lush junction of the Conemaugh and Stony Creek rivers. But every local can answer that question in an instant. For 36 years as representative of Pennsylvania&#8217;s 12th congressional district, including two decades dominating the defence appropriations subcommittee, the late Mr Murtha offered a masterclass on what it can mean for such a district to send to Washington, DC, an operator who knows his way around budget earmarks and can bring home the pork. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Murtha&#8217;s death last February has put that legacy in question. His former economic staffer, Mark Critz, hopes to step into his master&#8217;s boots in a special election to fill the seat on May 18th. Mr Critz is endorsed by Mr Murtha&#8217;s popular widow, Joyce Murtha, and by Norm Dicks, the new appropriations chairman. This is doubtless intended to convey the impression that in the safe hands of his apprentice Mr Murtha&#8217;s earmarking sorcery will continue to spirit federal dollars over the Alleghenies and into Pennsylvania&#8217;s 12th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And yet a smooth succession is not assured. Local people wonder whether the system can, or indeed should, outlive the man. Michele Trevorrow, a lifelong Johnstowner and mother of five boys, complains that Mr Murtha spent 36 years making the area dependent on him. She intends to vote for Tim Burns, the Republican, in the hope that a local man who built a middle-sized pharmacy-technology business from scratch knows how to foster new businesses that can become independent of government &#8220;and not depend on his winning the next election&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Republicans say that in Mr Burns they have found their very own version of Scott Brown, the Republican who destroyed the Democrats&#8217; supermajority in the Senate last January by capturing Ted Kennedy&#8217;s former Senate seat in Democratic Massachusetts. In a district where most registered voters are Democrats, some recent polls have indeed given the Republican Mr Burns a narrow lead. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But a Democratic reversal here would not be an earthquake on the scale of Massachusetts. The Democrats of this predominantly white, blue-collar corner of rustbelt Pennsylvania are a conservative lot who did not think highly of Barack Obama when he was running for president. They have neither forgotten nor forgiven his remark that &#8220;bitter&#8221; workers in these troubled regions cling to guns and religion &#8220;as a way to explain their frustrations&#8221;. The 12th is the only district in the country to have voted for Democratic John Kerry in 2004 and Republican John McCain in 2008. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An important element of the Republican strategy is therefore to focus attention on Washington. &#8220;This election has become a referendum on the Obama administration,&#8221; says Mr Burns over a Coke in the Famous Coney Island Hot Dogs restaurant, a Johnstown landmark. And to judge by the scorn his campaign heaps on &#8220;Nancy Pelosi&#8217;s&#8221; health legislation you would think that the speaker of the House was on the ballot herself. Raymond Wrabley, a political scientist at the local campus of the University of Pittsburgh, says that in a Catholic area opposed to abortion and sceptical of gay rights, greenery and feminism, Ms Pelosi provides the Republicans with a convenient symbol of the cultural radicalism locals do not like: &#8220;a power-grabbing advocate for all the fringe elements in society that are using the federal government to force their values on us&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Critz has accordingly been careful to distance himself from his party&#8217;s liberals. He is pro-guns and pro-life, and claims that he would have opposed Obamacare if he had been in Congress at the time. It is telling that he has not yet sought a personal endorsement from the president. But Mr Burns points to the help Mr Critz receives from other Democratic bigwigs: &#8220;He raises money from the liberals in Washington to tell the people here that he&#8217;s not a liberal.&#8221; Mr Burns&#8217;s own campaign has received generous help from local tea-party groups. Newt Gingrich, a possible presidential candidate for 2012, has stumped on his behalf and Sarah Palin has endorsed him through her oracular Facebook page. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The special election on May 18th will not be straightforward. The victor serves only to the end of the present Congress, so on the same day voters will choose between nominees for November&#8217;s mid-terms. In this primary race, Mr Burns is facing Bill Russell, a retired army officer who performed well against Mr Murtha in 2008, winning 42% of the vote, and who resents being passed over by the party establishment. Local factors count for a lot in Pennsylvania&#8217;s 12th, cautions Mr Wrabley, the political scientist. He says it would be a mistake for the national leadership of either party to read too much into a victory on polling day. That won&#8217;t stop them. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>WHEN the Exxon Valdez ran aground in 1989 and dumped its oily cargo into Alaskan waters, it killed hordes of beautiful creatures and cost billions to clean up. The current spill in the Gulf of Mexico could prove even worse. A tanker can leak its load, but no more. A broken pipe connected to an oilfield may continue leaking until it is fixed. And since fixing it involves sending remote-controlled submarines a mile below the surface to tinker with mangled machinery in the dark, that could take a while. Small wonder that Barack Obama sounds so grave. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On April 20th an explosion crippled the Deepwater Horizon, an offshore oil rig. Eleven people are presumed dead. As <em>The Economist</em> went to press, a vast oil slick was drifting towards American beaches and oyster beds. Flying down to Louisiana on May 2nd, Mr Obama described the spill as &#8220;a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster&#8221;. He warned that it &#8220;could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states and&#8230;jeopardise the livelihoods of thousands of Americans.&#8221; And he told television viewers that the federal government had &#8220;launched and co-ordinated an all-hands-on-deck, relentless response to this crisis from day one&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He was mindful, no doubt, that his predecessor&#8217;s political fortunes took a plunge after another environmental disaster in the same region in 2005. The federal response to Hurricane Katrina was slow and ineffectual, and George Bush dithered before visiting the wrecked city of New Orleans. He was widely decried as incompetent, insensitive, or both. Some people see parallels: Mr Obama also took his time to head for the Gulf coast, and was conspicuously larking around the previous night, telling jokes at the annual White House correspondents&#8217; dinner. (My approval ratings may be sinking, he said, but they &#8220;are still very high in the country of my birth&#8221;.) Hostile pundits mutter that the spill is &#8220;Obama&#8217;s Katrina&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The label has yet to catch on, however. For one thing, Mr Obama is plainly juggling multiple crises, from floods in Tennessee to a bomb in Times Square. The oil spill has not produced wrenching televised images of human suffering, as Katrina did. And Mr Obama has not yet made any obvious foul-ups. Addressing Gulf coast residents, he sounded calm but firm. &#8220;Let me be clear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;BP [the oil firm] is responsible for this leak; BP will be paying the bill.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far, the spill has probably not altered many people&#8217;s minds about Mr Obama. That could change: no one knows how long the crisis will linger, or how bad the damage will be. But for now, the spill&#8217;s main political effect has been to pollute the debate about energy. Before the rig exploded, America was inching fitfully towards a coherent energy policy. Not a perfect one, and certainly not a moment too soon, but a better one than before, and better late than never. Before the spill, Mr Obama&#8217;s approach was to offer something for everyone. To please greens, he proposed subsidies for renewable energy and curbs on greenhouse gases. To stop consumers from revolting, he was prepared to phase in those curbs slowly. To placate conservatives, he promoted nuclear power and recently came out for more offshore oil-drilling. That last idea is now on hold. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Any sensible policy needs to recognise two facts. First, fossil fuels are warming the planet. Second, America cannot suddenly stop using them. Since many Republicans deny the first point and some Democrats underplay the second, getting a bill through Congress is hard; and it has just got a lot harder. The Democrats will need at least a few Republican votes in the Senate, since they now control only 59 votes, one short of the number needed to break a filibuster. That is unlikely to happen before the mid-term elections&#8212;Lindsey Graham, the keenest Republican on the idea, was working on a bill with two Democrats but walked out last month when Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, said that he had decided to tackle immigration first. Conceivably Senator Graham can be wooed back, possibly along with a couple of his colleagues. But the wooing will be a lot trickier if Democrats block new domestic drilling, as several propose. Bill Nelson, a Democratic senator from Florida, says that any energy bill allowing offshore drilling would be &#8220;dead on arrival&#8221;. Governors of coastal states are terrified, too. Charlie Crist of Florida and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California both withdrew their support for drilling this week. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Lessons to be learned</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Disasters can be instructive. Both regulators and oil firms will learn useful lessons from the Deepwater Horizon fiasco, and safety will surely improve as a result. But it is easy to learn the wrong lessons, too. After the accident on Three Mile Island in 1979, Americans grew scared of nuclear power and stopped building new reactors, even though no one died in that accident. Had the nation not panicked, it would now have many more nuclear reactors, making the shift to a low-carbon economy significantly easier. Similarly today, panic is likely but unhelpful. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So long as Americans do not reduce their consumption of oil, refusing to drill at home means importing more of the stuff, often from places with looser environmental standards. The net effect is likely to be more pollution, not less. Nigeria, for example, has had a major oil spill every year since 1969, observes Lisa Margonelli of the New America Foundation, a think-tank. Putting a price on carbon would eventually spur the development of cleaner fuels, and persuade Americans to switch to them. But in the meantime, oil is both useful and precious. Extracting it domestically, with tougher safety rules, would bring a windfall to a Treasury that sorely needs one. When the current crisis is past, Mr Obama may remember this. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>The Goldilocks recovery</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Strict financial regulation and a new commodity boom have turned &#8220;boring&#8221; Canada into an economic star</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | OTTAWA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THEIR economy is so intertwined with their neighbour&#8217;s that when the United States plunged into recession, Canadians assumed they would be dragged along for the ride. Newspapers took to illustrating their economic stories with pictures of Depression-era bread lines. Yet whereas the United States has still not officially declared its recession over, Canada is nine months into recovery from its mildest and shortest downturn in recent history. Unemployment has been falling since last August, and proportionately fewer jobs were lost than south of the border.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Jim Flaherty, the finance minister, attributes Canada&#8217;s strong performance to its &#8220;boring&#8221; financial system. Prodded by tight regulation, the banks were much more conservative in their lending than their American counterparts. Those that did dabble in subprime loans were able to withdraw quickly. This prudence kept a lid on house prices while those in America were soaring, but it paid off when the bust hit. The volume and value of home sales in Canada are now at record highs. In some areas the market looks downright frothy: a modest house in Ottawa listed at C$439,000 ($435,000) recently sold for $600,000. &#8220;A lot of homes are selling in one day, and often for over the asking price,&#8221; says David Cullwick, a local estate agent. Rising prices have bolstered the construction industry and sellers of furniture and building materials. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>True to form, the authorities are moving to halt the party. During the recession the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate (to 0.25%), injected extra liquidity and bought up mortgage-backed securities. At its April policy meeting the bank withdrew its pledge not to raise rates. Analysts expect an increase in June. The government has ended tax credits for first-time house buyers and for renovations, which were granted in 2008 to stimulate demand.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For the other component of the country&#8217;s resilience&#8212;resurgent appetites for its exports of oil, gas, and minerals&#8212;Canadians have to thank policymakers in Beijing more than those in Ottawa. At their low point, prices for Canada&#8217;s commodity exports were still 50% higher than in previous recessions. Since then, they have rallied strongly. The impact is illustrated by the fortunes of Teck Resources, a Vancouver-based mining firm. It staggered into the recession loaded with a $9.8 billion debt taken on to buy the assets of a coal-mining company. For a while its survival was in doubt. Last month Teck not only announced that it had repaid the debt but also that it would pay a dividend. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The energy industry is coming back to life, with new investments planned for in Alberta&#8217;s oil sands. Last month Sinopec, a Chinese oil company, announced it would pay $4.65 billion for a 9% stake in Syncrude Canada, the largest operator in the sands. Such investments are controversial because of their environmental impact. But they are welcome in Alberta, where the government posted an unprecedented budget deficit last year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;Our regional economies are so diverse that there is always something leaning against the wind,&#8221; says Philip Cross, the chief economist at the government statistics agency. But the combination of commodity revenues and investors seeking safety in Canadian assets has caused the currency to take off. After falling as low as 77 American cents during the recession, the Canadian dollar has now returned to rough parity with the greenback.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is a tribute to the country&#8217;s success. But the central bank warns that a strong loonie, as the currency is known, will slow the recovery. It would be particularly harmful to manufacturing exporters, who were battered by the recession (car production fell by 31% in 2009). That might lead to further specialisation in natural resources. For now, concern about the loonie is muted, because most companies adapted to a stronger exchange rate during its previous run-up in 2007. Many of those that did not went bust. But if the currency continues to rise, the squeals will surely grow. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government of Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister, might have expected to receive more praise for the economy&#8217;s robust performance. If it has not, that may be partly because it insisted that the recession was imported from the outside world. Much of the country&#8217;s resilience stems from policies&#8212;such as bank regulation and sound public finances&#8212;which predate Mr Harper. The Bank of Canada can share some of the credit too. But Britons might note that Mr Harper has managed to govern for four years without a parliamentary majority, and that this has not prevented Canada from sailing through the recession. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>After Arias</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Tax increases, trade deals and antidisestablishmentarianism</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | SAN JOS\xC9 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SHE may be the first <em>presidenta </em>in a long line of Costa Rican<em> presidentes, </em>but when Laura Chinchilla is sworn in on May 8th she is liable to disappoint advocates of women&#8217;s rights. She supports her country&#8217;s restrictions on abortion and the morning-after pill, and opposes other liberal causes such as gay marriage and the disestablishment of the church. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Instead, her uncuddly passion is fighting crime. Although Costa Rica is relatively safe, a recent increase in violence has led to panic. The outbreak has been caused by growing inequality (says the left) and the spread of drug-trafficking gangs (says the right). Mrs Chinchilla promises to fight on both fronts, strengthening the police and getting more youths into classrooms.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To do this will cost money and there isn&#8217;t much. The government collects just 14.8% of national income in taxes, and its deficit is 4% of GDP. Mrs Chinchilla says she hopes to increase revenues by taxing casinos and online gambling, which her officials hope would bring in an extra 1% of GDP. Deeper fiscal reforms will have to wait a year or two for the economy to regain strength.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even then, to get her policies through, the new president will need to handle the legislature deftly. Mrs Chinchilla, of the centrist National Liberation Party, was elected with a thumping 47% of the vote in a crowded field of candidates, thanks in part to the popularity of her mentor and predecessor, \xD3scar Arias. Her party is the biggest in congress, but holds only 24 of the 57 seats. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>She will be reliant on a pact with the right-wing Libertarian Movement, whose leader, Otto Guevara, won 21% of the vote in this year&#8217;s presidential election, compared with just 2% in 2002. &#8220;The door to negotiation has opened,&#8221; says the confident Mr Guevara, flanked by portraits of his free-market heroes, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. But in return for supporting the government, he wants tougher sentences for petty criminals and the publication on the internet of the names of all those who receive state benefits. He vows to filibuster tax increases.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Costa Rica is richer, more democratic and more stable than its Central American neighbours. But it faces a choice between a bigger state and more reliance on the market. That dilemma was symbolised by the battle to approve the Central American Free-Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with the United States. Mr Arias campaigned hard for the accord, but only narrowly won a referendum on it in 2007. He also signed similar agreements with China and Singapore. Central America has also concluded free-trade talks with the European Union. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;We are inserting [Costa Rica] into the world economy,&#8221; Mr Arias says. His chief opponent, Otton Sol\xEDs, accuses him of selling the national interest short both with CAFTA, which obliges Costa Rica to open up the state-controlled telecoms and electricity industries, and in cuddling up to China. Mrs Chinchilla seems keen to change the subject. She plans closer ties in South America, and has toured Central America, patching up relations with awkward neighbours such as Nicaragua&#8217;s leftist autocrat, Daniel Ortega, with whom Mr Arias was publicly frustrated. One way and another, she may find her predecessor a hard act to follow. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Power grab</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Evo Morales&#8217;s allies grow restive</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | LA PAZ | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN ONE of Latin America&#8217;s least predictable countries it has become almost a ritual: on May 1st each year Evo Morales sends troops to nationalise a batch of companies in politically sensitive industries. This year it was the turn of four electricity generators. Two of them had European owners or partners, making them juicy targets. &#8220;We are fulfilling the people&#8217;s vociferous demand to recover and nationalise natural resources and basic services,&#8221; the president proclaimed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Since taking office in 2006 Mr Morales, Bolivia&#8217;s first elected president of indigenous descent, has taken over oil and gas, mining and telecoms businesses. Partly as a result, he is popular. When campaigning for a second term in an election last year, he promised that power companies would be next. The targeted firms thought they had avoided this fate by negotiating a deal in which the government would take a bare majority stake. No such luck. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the May Day nationalisation seems to be bringing Mr Morales diminishing returns. To his bemusement, workers at one of the nationalised companies, a co-operative in Cochabamba, staged a protest sit-in. Although Bolivia&#8217;s gas revenues have risen sharply, that has as much to do with higher prices and contracts signed before Mr Morales took office as with rolling back privatisation, according to Carlos Alberto L\xF3pez, an energy official in a previous government. Most of the newly state-run firms have performed poorly. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many Bolivians who cheered past expropriations are now more exercised about their salaries. The government has ordered wage rises of just 5% this year for both public- and private-sector workers. That is in line with forecast inflation, but the unions argue that it does not account for past price rises. Perhaps fearing unrest, Mr Morales skipped the May Day parade for the first time since he became president. Beneath their helmets and traditional Indian hats, the marchers&#8217; expressions were grim. Some carried signs denouncing the president&#8217;s purchase of a new French Dassault jet. On May 5th the unions staged a one-day general strike&#8212;the first under Mr Morales&#8212;and protesters set off dynamite at the doors of the labour ministry. Some union leaders are on hunger strike. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Morales hopes to mollify the unions by announcing that in state hands, electricity prices will drop by 20%. But if Bolivia&#8217;s other public enterprises are any guide, the power companies will probably become less efficient under government control. And the country needs to add 60MW of new generating capacity each year, at a cost of $60m, to meet the growth in demand. Governing Bolivia has suddenly become harder for Mr Morales. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The Beijing consensus is to keep quiet</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>In the West people worry that developing countries want to copy &#8220;the China model&#8221;. Such talk makes people in China uncomfortable</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | BEIJING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CHINESE officials said the opening of the World Expo in Shanghai on April 30th would be simple and frugal. It wasn&#8217;t. The display of fireworks, laser beams, fountains and dancers rivalled the extravagance of Beijing&#8217;s Olympic ceremonies in 2008. The government&#8217;s urge to show off Chinese dynamism proved irresistible. For many, the razzmatazz lit up the China model for all the world to admire. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The multi-billion-dollar expo embodies this supposed model, which has won China many admirers in developing countries and beyond. A survey by the Pew Research Centre, an American polling organisation, found that 85% of Nigerians viewed China favourably last year (compared with 79% in 2008), as did 50% of Americans (up from 39% in 2008) and 26% of Japanese (up from 14%, see chart). China&#8217;s ability to organise the largest ever World Expo, including a massive upgrade to Shanghai&#8217;s infrastructure, with an apparent minimum of the bickering that plagues democracies, is part of what dazzles. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Scholars and officials in China itself, however, are divided over whether there is a China model (or &#8220;Beijing consensus&#8221; as it was dubbed in 2004 by Joshua Cooper Ramo, an American consultant, playing on the idea of a declining &#8220;Washington consensus&#8221;), and if so what the model is and whether it is wise to talk about it. The Communist Party is diffident about laying claim to any development model that other countries might copy. Official websites widely noted a report by a pro-Party newspaper in Hong Kong, <em>Ta Kung Pao</em>, calling the expo &#8220;a display platform for the China model&#8221;. But Chinese leaders avoid using the term and in public describe the expo in less China-centred language. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not so China&#8217;s publishing industry, which in recent months has been cashing in on an upsurge of debate in China about the notion of a China model (one-party rule, an eclectic approach to free markets and a big role for state enterprise being among its commonly identified ingredients). In November a prominent Party-run publisher produced a 630-page tome titled &#8220;China Model: A New Development Model from the Sixty Years of the People&#8217;s Republic&#8221;. In January came the more modest &#8220;China Model: Experiences and Difficulties&#8221;. Another China-model book was launched in April and debated at an expo-related forum in Shanghai. Its enthusiastic authors include Zhao Qizheng, a former top Party propaganda official, and John Naisbitt, an American futurologist. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Western publishers have been no less enthused by China&#8217;s continued rapid growth. The most recent entry in the field is &#8220;The Beijing Consensus, How China&#8217;s Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the Twenty-First Century&#8221; by Stefan Halper, an American academic. Mr Halper, who has served as an official in various Republican administrations, argues that &#8220;just as globalisation is shrinking the world, China is shrinking the West&#8221; by quietly limiting the projection of its values. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But despite China&#8217;s status as &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest billboard advertisement for the new alternative&#8221; of going capitalist and staying autocratic, Party leaders are, as Mr Halper describes it, gripped by a fear of losing control and of China descending into chaos. It is this fear, he says, that is a driving force behind China&#8217;s worrying external behaviour. Party rule, the argument runs, depends on economic growth, which in turn depends on resources supplied by unsavoury countries. Politicians in Africa in fact rarely talk about following a &#8220;Beijing consensus&#8221;. But they love the flow of aid from China that comes without Western lectures about governance and human rights. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The same fear makes Chinese leaders reluctant to wax lyrical about a China model. They are acutely aware of American sensitivity to any talk suggesting the emergence of a rival power and ideology&#8212;and conflict with America could wreck China&#8217;s economic growth. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In 2003 Chinese officials began talking of the country&#8217;s &#8220;peaceful rise&#8221;, only to drop the term a few months later amid worries that even the word &#8220;rise&#8221; would upset the flighty Americans. Zhao Qizheng, the former propaganda official, writes that he prefers &#8220;China case&#8221; to &#8220;China model&#8221;. Li Junru, a senior Party theorist, said in December that talk of a China model was &#8220;very dangerous&#8221; because complacency might set in that would sap enthusiasm for further reforms. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some Chinese lament that this is already happening. Political reform, which the late architect of China&#8217;s developmental model, Deng Xiaoping, once argued was essential for economic liberalisation, has barely progressed since he crushed the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Liu Yawei of the Carter Centre, an American human-rights group wrote last month that efforts by Chinese scholars to promote the idea of a China model have become &#8220;so intense and effective&#8221; that political reform has been &#8220;swept aside&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chinese leaders&#8217; fear of chaos suggests they themselves are not convinced that they have found the right path. Talk of a model is made all the harder by the stability-threatening problems that breakneck growth engenders, from environmental destruction to rampant corruption and a growing gap between rich and poor. One of China&#8217;s more outspoken media organisations, Caixin, this week published an article by Joseph Nye, an American academic. In it Mr Nye writes of the risks posed by China&#8217;s uncertain political trajectory. &#8220;Generations change, power often creates hubris and appetites sometimes grow with eating,&#8221; he says. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One Western diplomat, using the term made famous by Mr Nye, describes the expo as a &#8220;competition between soft powers&#8221;. But if China&#8217;s soft power is in the ascendant and America&#8217;s declining&#8212;as many Chinese commentators write&#8212;the event, which is due to end on October 31st, hardly shows it. True, China succeeded in persuading a record number of countries to take part. But visitor turnout has been far lower than organisers had anticipated. And queues outside America&#8217;s dour pavilion have been among the longest.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Annals of weird diplomacy</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>North Korea&#8217;s leader pretends not to be visiting his patrons</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | BEIJING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN A musty corner of China&#8217;s diplomatic world, it seems, communist brethren are permitted to move about unseen. Even as North Korea&#8217;s reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, was touring Chinese port cities on his first known foreign trip in four years, Chinese officials were refusing to confirm that he was even in the country. Mr Kim likes to travel furtively and China grudgingly humours him. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But Mr Kim&#8217;s train, say South Korea&#8217;s media, did chug over the border into the Chinese city of Dandong on May 3rd and from there headed to the nearby port of Dalian. He then proceeded to the northern city of Tianjin and thence to Beijing for meetings with Chinese leaders. Mr Kim was expected to ask for more food and aid for his blighted, benighted country. China wants him in return to agree to re-enter negotiations with itself, America, South Korea, Japan and Russia about dismantling his nuclear programmes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China dearly wishes Mr Kim would behave normally. If there is one country where it would like to promote a &#8220;China model&#8221; of development (see ), it is North Korea. But efforts to prod its neighbour into adopting Chinese-style reforms are reminiscent of the way America tries to nudge China onto a more liberal path. The attempts are guarded by an anticipation of failure. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On Mr Kim&#8217;s previous trip abroad in 2006 (no word of which was officially announced until he had gone home), he went to the southern city of Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong and the cradle of China&#8217;s economic reforms. <em>Wen Wei Po</em>, a newspaper in Hong Kong closely aligned with the Chinese Communist Party, quoted an unnamed observer as saying Mr Kim might have made the trip because the trendsetting region had the kind of experience that North Korea could &#8220;draw inspiration from&#8221;. How wrong can you be?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This time <em>China Daily</em>, a government-controlled newspaper in Beijing (oddly quoting Yonhap, a South Korean news agency), noted that Dalian, Mr Kim&#8217;s first stop, was &#8220;a northeast port city known as a model of market reforms&#8221;. It is indeed a world apart from anything Mr Kim will have seen in his own country: vibrant, prosperous and replete with high-tech factories, many of them built with the help of foreign investment. But if Mr Kim dreams of replicating Dalian&#8217;s experience at home, he shows no sign of understanding how to begin.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Futenma farce</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>There is little to cheer in a shoddily executed about-face on Okinawa</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>YUKIO HATOYAMA, Japan&#8217;s leader, does not exude political gravitas. So it was dispiritingly in-character that when he made an announcement on May 4th that could make or break his premiership, he did so on a national holiday, speaking unpersuasively to the very people most likely to disapprove of what he said.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The bombshell he dropped on his first visit as prime minister to the island of Okinawa was that he was backtracking on what has become the most sensitive promise of last year&#8217;s election campaign&#8212;to move an American marine base off the island and possibly out of Japan altogether. It sounded like the change of heart that America has been waiting for for months. Yet the silence from Washington after his visit to Okinawa was ominous, speaking eloquently of an apparent lack of faith in Mr Hatoyama himself.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His explanation, as far as it went, made sense, though it took a painfully long time to reach. After long deliberation, the prime minister said, he had concluded that the security of a region with a nuclear-armed, reckless North Korea depends, in part, on having some American marines in Okinawa. But instead of seizing the opportunity to explain to Okinawans how American troops help keep the peace, he referred to the soldiers dismissively as a &#8220;burden&#8221; that had to be shared by Okinawans.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It was an appeal bound to fall on deaf ears among islanders who play host to half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan. It may have been doubly galling coming from a man who had rashly promised last year to tear up a treaty to relocate the Futenma air base within Okinawa, but had no Plan B to offer America. &#8220;Liar&#8221;, &#8220;traitor&#8221;, &#8220;shame on you&#8221;, shouted protesters in the crowd.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hatoyama still has a little time to salvage his reputation. He has set himself a deadline of May 31st to resolve the Futenma issue fully. Yet it seems likely he will end up parroting this week&#8217;s unilateral course of action, rather than reach a workable agreement among the parties involved. Reaction from Okinawan politicians to Mr Hatoyama bordered on hostile. Part of his proposal appears to involve sending some of the marines&#8217; helicopters to another island, Tokunoshima. Most islanders there also flatly oppose the idea.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So the issue remains fraught, which will cost Mr Hatoyama&#8217;s Democratic Party of Japan dearly in the run-up to upper-house elections this summer. There are calls within the party for him to resign if he cannot reach a satisfactory outcome by the end of this month.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The trouble is that even if he does quit, his successor risks falling into the same Futenma trap, unless all sides learn to be more accommodating. The Obama administration may have got off to a bad start with Mr Hatoyama. It would not want to repeat the mistake if, as some now hope, he is eventually replaced.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Himalayan precipice</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Time is running out for attempts to settle the country&#8217;s confrontation</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | KATHMANDU | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NEPAL&#8217;S Maoists can put on an impressive display. For the past week they have endured torrential rain and outbreaks of diarrhoea to bring the capital, Kathmandu, and the rest of the country, to a halt. Then, on May 4th, tens of thousands formed a human chain around both sides of the 27km (17-mile) ring road, surrounding and cutting off the capital. In a country where politics is marked by incompetence and cynicism, no other force can match the former rebels for commitment or organisation&#8212;which is only one reason why everyone else finds them so frightening. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After ten years of insurgency the Maoists laid down their arms and signed a peace deal in 2006. That deal is now on the verge of collapse. The heart of the process is the writing of a new constitution, a long-standing Maoist demand. When a Constituent Assembly was elected in 2008 to write it, the Maoists emerged with an effective veto and twice as many seats as their nearest rival. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then things started falling apart. A Maoist-led government resigned after less than a year when the prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known as Prachanda (&#8220;fierce one&#8221;), sacked the army chief as part of a dispute over integrating former guerrillas into the army&#8212;only to see him controversially reinstated by the president. With some prodding from India, 22 parties cobbled together an anti-Maoist coalition, but the constitution-writing process stalled. May 28th marks the expiry of the interim charter under which the country has been operating. If there is no agreement to amend it, Nepal will plunge into legal limbo. No one knows what law&#8212;if any&#8212;will then apply.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Agreement seems remote. The aim is to sign a &#8220;package deal&#8221; in which&#8212;in theory&#8212;all sides will have something to show for the concessions that will inevitably be needed. The trouble is this requires tackling the issues that have proved most intractable over the three years of the peace process, notably the integration of Maoist fighters. There is no sign that these problems are getting any easier. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The timing is tricky, too: which steps should be taken before today&#8217;s government resigns and which after? The Maoists insist that nothing is possible until the departure of the prime minister, Madav Kumar Nepal. Forming the next government is another headache: the Maoist candidate for prime minister is Prachanda himself, but he is unacceptable to many others, including (it is thought) India.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then there are deeper problems of trust. Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoists&#8217; deputy leader, calls the government a coalition of elites bent on preserving their power and privileges. &#8220;The elites&#8221;, he says, do not want to finish writing a constitution, because they know they will lose the election which must then take place.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But to their many opponents, the Maoists have not kept their promises to abandon violence and have not truly embraced democracy. It is certainly true that stick-wielding members of the Young Communist League on the streets of Kathmandu look scary and trade unions allied to the Maoists are often high-handed. On the other hand, killings by the Maoists have become rare even though at least half a dozen of their own members have been murdered since the beginning of the year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nor do the ruling parties have strong democratic credentials themselves. The prime minister and one of his deputies lost elections in their constituencies and got into parliament only because there are special seats which the parties fill through nomination. Rumour links ministers from several coalition parties to criminal groups that perpetrate most of Nepal&#8217;s violence, as well as to the opium-poppy farming which has recently spread in the increasingly lawless south.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far the protests have remained mostly peaceful but clashes are occurring, tempers are fraying and hardliners on all sides are itching for a fight. The Maoists draw much support from the young and underemployed&#8212;the country&#8217;s biggest single group. Having fought for so long, they are not about to fade away now. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>System error</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>To err is human but to really foul things up you need a computer</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | MANILA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WITH less than a week to go before the Philippines&#8217; presidential and congressional elections on May 10th, hopes of a credible result are diminishing. So are the chances that the polls will produce a new start for the country&#8217;s fractious politics.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The immediate cause of the worry is the discovery of glitches in a computerised system for counting the votes. The country has introduced computerised vote-counting to prevent the kind of cheating that marred previous elections. The laborious process of tallying votes by hand used to provide plenty of room for fraud. But the new system has been plagued with problems of its own.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Final tests on the counting machines that are being installed in 70,000 polling stations across the country showed that they made breathtaking mistakes in tallying votes. The organisation responsible for conducting the poll, the Commission on Elections (Comelec), is now frantically trying to install new memory cards in every machine before polling day. It is a huge job: the Philippines has 50m voters spread out over 7,000 islands.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The rush to fix the latest glitches followed Comelec&#8217;s revelation that it had evidence of a plot to disenfranchise voters by exploiting their unfamiliarity with the machine-countable ballot forms. Comelec did not say who was behind this plot or how exactly it would work.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The latest revelation provoked calls to postpone the elections by some of President Gloria Arroyo&#8217;s advisers. Her spokesman said postponement was up to Comelec. Its response was to declare that the elections would be held as scheduled.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Unfortunately, the country may be damned if it does and damned if it doesn&#8217;t. If the elections take place as planned, and the computerised system fails&#8212;ie, produces incredible or incomplete results&#8212;then the unsuccessful candidates are likely to complain either that the system was rigged to cheat them or that it was designed to fail so that the unpopular Mrs Arroyo could remain in office while the mess is sorted out. (Mrs Arroyo is not a candidate, and says she will step down when her term ends at the end of June.) The favourite to replace her, according to most opinion polls, is Noynoy Aquino. Mr Aquino has already warned that if he is not proclaimed the winner, there will be a &#8220;People Power&#8221; uprising like the one in 1986 that put his mother, Corazon Aquino, in the presidential palace.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Alas, postponement seems no more attractive. True, it might increase the chances of a successful, undisputed election. But it is equally likely to encourage suspicion that Mrs Arroyo is plotting to cling to power&#8212;and equally likely to bring demonstrators out into the streets.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A year after the war, some northerners are still awaiting a peace dividend</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | JAFFNA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TRAMPLING weeds underfoot, a group of people bound excitedly into an abandoned cemetery for Tamil Tiger rebels, hack bricks off the once pristine tombs and throw them into a waiting van. They are, sighs a local Tamil autorickshaw driver resignedly, &#8220;Sinhala tourists&#8221;&#8212;members of Sri Lanka&#8217;s ethnic majority, collecting souvenirs to take back home in the south. Since the main north-south highway reopened to civilian traffic in December 2009, thousands of such visitors have been streaming to Sri Lanka&#8217;s northern peninsula, eager to make up for lost time. Alas, reconstruction and ethnic reconciliation are not following in their wake as quickly as people had hoped.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For much of the past three decades the Tigers were locked in conflict with the government and inessential travel to the north was neither sought nor encouraged. Today, visitors are so numerous that owners of wedding and reception venues are turning their halls into dormitories on days when they are not booked for parties. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Jaffna is bustling. Banks and mobile-phone companies are rushing into a market that one sales manager describes as bursting with potential. A spokesman for an international bank that set up a local branch four months ago says its short-term targets have already been met&#8212;perhaps not surprising given that many families are supported by remittances from relatives who fled the fighting and settled abroad. Land prices have spiralled. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Around 35,000 people visited a recent trade fair, says Kanagasabai Poornachandran, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yalpanam. More than 200 companies, 12 of them Indian, rented stalls, selling everything from spices, seeds, cosmetics and disco lights to loans, mobile-phone packages, construction equipment and tractors. After years of blackouts and rationing, Jaffna at last has a stable power supply. Still, in a reminder of the debilitating effect of the war, fewer than 20 stalls were selling native Jaffna fare. With no manufacturing to speak of, fishing and farming keep the peninsula going. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A year after the war, reconstruction in Jaffna is marred by the perception that the benefits are being reaped by the government and distant companies. Chinese firms are rebuilding the north&#8217;s main road network. A state-owned bank is financing Jaffna&#8217;s first three-star hotel. Young people lack the training employers want; joblessness remains a problem. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nor has the end of fighting brought the lifting of military restrictions. Foreigners need defence-ministry permission to visit the peninsula. So do vehicles with commercial cargo. Far from the city centre, a local-government official, whose older brother&#8212;a senior rebel leader&#8212;was killed during the final days of the war, laments the dashed hopes of those who had expected development to take off. The war may be over but mindsets, it seems, are slow to change.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The troubling dynamics of insurgency</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Kandahar will be the biggest test of NATO&#8217;s new strategy to combat the Taliban</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | KANDAHAR | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AHMED WALI KARZAI sighs wearily as he recounts the latest bit of bad news. &#8220;They just shot another elder from Arghandab. Haji Daoud or someone. It&#8217;s just a poor guy, an elder who has nothing to do with the government.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Barely a day goes by in which Ahmed Wali, half-brother to President Hamid Karzai and a sort of viceroy to the turbulent, Taliban-filled south, is not briefed about another killing. As America and its allies gear up for their big fight of the summer&#8212;to extend control over the southern province of Kandahar, which they call the cornerstone of the counterinsurgency campaign&#8212;the Taliban have been on a killing spree. Officials, Afghans working for foreign-aid organisations and tribal elders are all targets.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deputy mayor of Kandahar was murdered while he prayed in a mosque. Workers for NGOs have fled well-paid jobs after death threats. Last week the United Nations told its local staff to stay home and evacuated its few international staff. Threats and assassinations have been going on for years, but the spate of killings and the liberal use of bombs have spread fear, even panic, through the city.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>General David Petraeus, head of US Central Command, has warned that &#8220;horrific actions&#8221; by the Taliban will meet the attempt by American, Afghan and Canadian forces to wrest control of the province. Still, commanders are happy to talk about their plans for Kandahar, as they were in February before a well-publicised assault on Marja, a small farming community in Helmand. They say that unlike in Marja the offensive will not come in a single blow. There will be fighting in some areas, particularly the districts of Panjwayi and Zhari, where conflict has been sporadic for years. But elsewhere NATO will gradually step up operations, quietly increasing the number of soldiers and (they hope) improving the quality of local government. Military activities within the city, which tend to attract trouble, will be kept to a minimum. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Such tactics are part of the strategy outlined last year by General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of allied forces. They are intended both to reassure the population and to encourage insurgents not to fight.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far, though, the evidence suggests they are having the opposite effect in Kandahar. With reports of civilian casualties in Marja ringing in their ears, Kandaharis strongly oppose the coming operation&#8212;something tribal elders impressed on Hamid Karzai when he visited their city last month. Some fear that fighting in the surrounding countryside will push insurgents into Kandahar city, traditionally a sanctuary. Moreover, people living in outlying urban areas say the Taliban, far from being repelled by the prospect of an allied surge, are massing as never before. Faiz Mohamad, a shopkeeper in Zhari, says hundreds of teenage Taliban have arrived in his native village from Pakistan. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No doubt many of those fresh-faced fighters will be killed or forced to flee in the next few months. But that, as NATO officials say, is the easy bit. Long-term security will not be achieved unless Kandahar&#8217;s politics can be improved. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That means dealing with a tight-knit group of leaders who since 2001 have managed to monopolise political power and the lucrative &#8220;war economy&#8221;, which is based on foreign military contracts for construction, logistics and private security. Ahmed Wali is usually regarded as the archetypal beneficiary, though he denies he has profited from any military contracts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nonetheless, his dominance and that of his Popolzai tribe has created grievances among both ordinary people and other tribal leaders, particularly the Ghilzai. According to Carl Forsberg, an American expert on Kandahar&#8217;s politics, &#8220;many of the local power brokers who are excluded from Wali Karzai&#8217;s network see the Taliban insurgency as the only viable means of political opposition.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A few months ago NATO generals said that a big offensive in Kandahar was pointless as long as Ahmed Wali remained in power. But Ahmed Wali enjoys strong support from his brother in Kabul and the Americans seem to have lost their appetite for getting rid of him, perhaps on the grounds that this is the devil they know. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Instead, they hope Afghans will &#8220;shura their way to success&#8221;, in the words of Lieutenant-General Nick Parker, General McChrystal&#8217;s deputy. The plan is that by establishing lots of consultative gatherings, or shuras, those who feel excluded will be brought into the decision-making. Assuming, of course, they will want to take part in something that seems likely to attract the bullet or the bomb of a Taliban assassin. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h2>People power ain't what it used to be; actually, it never was</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>RED flags, complete with hammer-and-sickle, flutter in their hundreds in Kathmandu, as throngs of disgruntled Maoists bring Nepal&#8217;s capital to a familiar standstill. In central Bangkok red-shirted protesters still man barricades around some of the best-known streets, paralysing offices, shops, hotels and even girlie bars. This week&#8217;s agreement to enter a &#8220;reconciliation process&#8221; did not amount to surrender on their main demand for an early election. Elsewhere, in Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s capital, Bishkek, an interim government is seeking to reassure people at home and abroad that it really is in power. It is offering bounties for the capture of fugitive members of the regime overthrown last month after the security forces had killed more than 80 people.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Revolution is in the air in Asia again, as it was two decades ago, when a series of &#8220;people-power&#8221; movements swept unpopular regimes from government; or forced them into big reforms; or, in two countries, were quelled by a hail of bullets. In the Philippines in 1986, South Korea in 1987, what was then Burma the following year, China in 1989, Mongolia, Nepal and Taiwan (in its own low-key, rather efficient way) in 1990 and then Thailand in 1992, street demonstrations graduated from spontaneous outbursts easily shrugged off by confident governments, to threats to those governments&#8217; very survival. Then, as now, the anger had different roots in different countries. But protesters took heart from the courage and, sometimes, success of their counterparts elsewhere&#8212;not just in Asia but in eastern Europe too. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There has been a big change since then. The latest wave of protest movements is directed not against autocracies, but regimes that are, at least formally, pluralist democracies. Indeed, in Nepal, Thailand and Kyrgyzstan, the protesters&#8217; enemy is the regime installed after a similar earlier movement. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Or, in Nepal&#8217;s case, two earlier movements. The 1990 unrest that led to the constitutional monarchy was followed in 2006 by &#8220;Jana Andolan 2&#8221;, a second &#8220;people&#8217;s movement&#8221; led by an alliance of mainstream parties and Maoists. It toppled the dictatorship of Nepal&#8217;s King Gyanendra. But the Kathmandu elite, the non-Maoist parties and the army have been loth to cede real power to the Maoists, the most successful party at the 2008 election. Hence the present confrontation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That history has obvious echoes in Bangkok. In 1992 civilian protests against military rule ended in a massacre&#8212;and produced a consensus that the days of unstable, corrupt civilian coalitions punctuated by army-led interregnums must end. A new constitution in 1997 seemed to mark the beginning of an era of democratic rule. But the voters&#8217; repeated choice of parties loyal to Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister now in exile, proved unacceptable to the powers-that-were. He was ousted in a coup in 2006, but his proxies won an election a year later, only to be turfed out in September 2008 after months of street agitation by yellow-shirted protesters. That successful precedent has hung over the two-month red-shirt siege of Bangkok. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Kyrgyzstan the &#8220;tulip&#8221; revolution of 2005 replaced the nasty, corrupt, repressive, nepotistic, Soviet-era strongman, Askar Akayev, with Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who soon turned into a nasty, corrupt, repressive, nepotistic post-Soviet strongman. When his forces fired on demonstrators last month, they provoked a response on the streets less colourful, but far swifter, more violent and more determined than the romantic idealism of old-style people power. Rather than flags and banners Mr Bakiyev&#8217;s enraged opponents carried staves, clubs and baseball bats. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are a number of lessons to be drawn from these histories of recidivist uprisings. The first is that old power structures are often far more tenacious than they appear. &#8220;The genie is out of the bottle,&#8221; most observers grandly declared in Tiananmen Square in May 1989 (Banyan, alas, among them). At the time, the state seemed almost to have surrendered control of the Chinese capital and change looked inevitable and permanent. It was, but in almost any direction other than towards the political pluralism that had then been deemed inevitable.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another moral is that one people-power revolt begets another. The heroic &#8220;EDSA revolution&#8221; in 1986 against Ferdinand Marcos, dictator of the Philippines, served as the model for the far shabbier hounding from office in 2001 of Joseph Estrada&#8212;a lousy president, but an elected one. It is far easier to dispose of a dictator and build a plausible democratic structure than to build a genuinely pluralist culture. In dictatorships many people suffer from the understandable delusion that democracy means having the government you want. In practice, a more telling characteristic is having to put up with one you don&#8217;t want until you get a chance to vote. The idea of a loyal opposition still sounds in many parts of the world like a contradiction in terms.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Mao was right about where power comes from</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The final lesson from looking at the history of these popular uprisings is that they only succeed if the security forces allow them to. That is not to say that they must enjoy the army&#8217;s support. But they can be stopped if soldiers are prepared to slaughter enough of their own people. Mercifully few regimes have that kind of determination. Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s was one. Myanmar&#8217;s junta, now with the blood of monks on its hands, may be another. Uzbekistan&#8217;s, in denial and unrepentant about killings in Andijan in 2005, perhaps a third. But Thailand&#8217;s army seems reluctant to spill more blood by confronting the red shirts again. Even China&#8217;s government, despite harsh repression of ethnic protests in Tibet and Xinjiang, must wonder whether it could again order the army to turn its tanks and weapons on civilians in Beijing. Indeed, the past two decades of Chinese policy have been a concerted campaign to make sure it never has to. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>The politicians wrangle as the nerves of the people jangle</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The prime minister clings to power after an election defeat, while worries over security persist</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | BAGHDAD | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EMBATTLED Iraqi leaders, before and after Saddam Hussein, have tended to assert their authority by showing off their toughness, even their readiness to kill people who try to do them down. Nuri al-Maliki (above), the prime minister who narrowly lost a general election in March but remains in office while others seek to form a coalition to push him out, has been flaunting his tough-guy credentials.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Last month he got a big boost after his forces surrounded a farmhouse in northern Iraq and, with American help, killed two al-Qaeda leaders, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri, who for years had been taunting Iraq&#8217;s Shia majority and terrifying people of every sectarian hue in Baghdad and Mosul, the biggest northern city, with suicide-bombs in markets and other such public places. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Though Mr Maliki&#8217;s election alliance got two seats fewer than that of his main rival, Iyad Allawi, the incumbent seems as determined as ever to hang on. This week he announced he would in principle form a coalition government with a Shia religious group, including followers of a fiery cleric, Muqtada al-Sadr, that came third in the election. But Mr Maliki is still far from assured of keeping his post. Indeed, many rival Iraqi politicians think he is unlikely to do so. Neighbouring governments in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Kuwait are determined that he should step down. And the outgoing Americans, albeit that their clout is fading, would prefer Mr Allawi to have the job. At the very least, they want Mr Allawi to have a big role in a unity government, since he won the largest chunk of votes from Iraq&#8217;s Sunni minority, who ruled the roost under Saddam Hussein and have been at the heart of the insurgency against the new Shia order.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In any event, the timing and publicity of the killing of the al-Qaeda leaders were especially agreeable to Mr Maliki. He had recently had little to cheer about since his alliance&#8217;s defeat at the hands of Mr Allawi&#8217;s lot, which won 91 out of 325 seats in parliament to the incumbent&#8217;s 89.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But Mr Maliki has been doggedly seeking to cling on in other ways. He has alleged electoral fraud, demanding a recount in five of Iraq&#8217;s 18 provinces. Election officials have agreed to a new tally of ballots only in Baghdad, which has 68 seats. But a small shift in Mr Maliki&#8217;s favour could make a difference, hence the zeal of his supporters. Helped by sympathetic judges, they even stopped the recount as it got going on May 3rd, and tried to rewrite the rules in their favour.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Maliki&#8217;s aim is not only to take seats from Mr Allawi. He has tried to delay certification of the result, thus slowing down the process of forming a government. Re-examining 2.5m Baghdad votes will take weeks, giving him longer to negotiate an alliance with smaller parties in the hope of keeping Mr Allawi out. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This week&#8217;s apparent deal between Mr Maliki&#8217;s team and the religiously minded Iraqi National Alliance (INA), which includes the Hakim family&#8217;s once-dominant Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq as well as Mr Sadr&#8217;s fiercely populist and nationalist group, is far from sealed. Neither front has agreed on who would become prime minister. Some say a former holder of the post, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, who is part of the INA, could be brought back as a compromise figure, as he was before. Many people in the INA despise Mr Maliki and have vowed to deny him a second term. A Western diplomat calls the tentative deal &#8220;an engagement rather than a marriage&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile Mr Maliki is also co-operating with a shadowy parliamentary committee controlled by the INA that has the power to banish politicians for alleged sympathies with Saddam Hussein and for senior membership of his Baath party. It has singled out 52 candidates in the recent election, including 22 from Mr Allawi&#8217;s slate. Few won a seat, but as their votes may be voided their removal could alter the overall result. However, Reidar Visser, a Norwegian who has mastered the mathematical minutiae of Iraqi electoral politics, calculates that Mr Maliki might narrow the gap in parliament by only a seat.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What is most gloomily clear is that if Messrs Maliki and Allawi remain set on preventing each other from becoming prime minister, Iraq could slip back into sectarian division and violence. Most of the candidates Mr Maliki is seeking to bar are Sunni. Iraqi Sunnis in general feel he is trying to flout the people&#8217;s will expressed at the ballot box. &#8220;This witch-hunt must end,&#8221; says Mr Visser.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Maliki&#8217;s tactics already risk giving the insurgents a new lease of life. Hoping to exploit the political tension, they have struck spectacularly three times since the election. Groups of suicide-bombers have hit foreign embassies, alcohol shops and mosques in Baghdad. The civilian death toll has risen from 216 in March to 274 in April. This in turn has led to calls for sectarian militias to return to the streets to protect citizens. If they did, it could presage a step back towards the bloody sectarian strife that dipped sharply after 2007.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Don&#8217;t make the Sunnis surly</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Already the &#8220;Sons of Iraq&#8221;, the Sunni tribal militias that were brought into the new security order in 2007 and crucially helped turn the Sunnis away from al-Qaeda and from the pro-Saddam insurgency, are sounding sore, especially since their political representatives in the so-called Awakening movement performed dismally in the election, partly due to its own disunity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another reason for a recent surge of Sunni anger is a slew of well-documented reports that some 430 Sunni prisoners have been appallingly tortured in a secret prison run by a unit that answers to the prime minister. If Mr Allawi, a secular Shia with substantial Sunni support, is kept out of government by the two predominantly Shia alliances working in tandem, the Sunnis may be tempted to abet an insurgency all over again.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Allawi has asked foreign governments to help. Iraqi politicians tend to trust them more than they do each other. Turkey and Saudi Arabia may try to oblige but Iran, which dislikes Mr Allawi, has been scheming to keep him out. The Americans like him. But their primary aim is to withdraw their combat troops by August 31st, leaving up to 50,000 &#8220;advisers&#8221; in Iraq until the end of next year. Mr Maliki has castigated Mr Allawi&#8217;s call for mediation as a bid for &#8220;foreign interference in our internal affairs that would breach our sovereignty&#8221;. He has even hinted at a plot to topple his government.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A growing number of Iraqis want a government of national unity to include both Mr Maliki and Mr Allawi. Together they would have the legitimacy and the clout to tackle almost any issue. Yet so far they seem bent on preventing that happier state of affairs. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A president trots the globe</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad looks far afield for diplomatic help</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | CAIRO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS WESTERN leaders agonised over how to deter Iran from making a nuclear bomb, the Islamic Republic&#8217;s president marched into the lion&#8217;s den of the United Nations in New York on May 3rd as the sole head of state to address the conference, held every five years, to review the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad mocked the treaty as a failure. Instead of picking on countries like Iran, which do not possess an atom bomb, the rest of the world should, he said, rid itself of existing nuclear weapons. Iran, he declared, would be happy to join in any effort to ban the bomb. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Mr Ahmadinejad digressed with a brief tirade about supposed CIA and Zionist support for terrorist networks, Western delegates walked out. But his harping on the double standards of a system that lets some strong states keep weapons while preventing weaker ones from having them did draw some nods of approval, especially from leaders of the poorer parts of the world. So did his remark on American television that although America and Russia have lately agreed to reduce their arsenals, they have not agreed to let neutral inspectors in to confirm their own compliance. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Ahmadinejad has been particularly active in his globe-trotting diplomacy to fend off efforts by America and other Western governments to penalise Iran in the UN Security Council for its defiance over its nuclear activities. He has vigorously wooed the council&#8217;s non-permanent members, such as Austria, Bosnia, Brazil, Lebanon, Turkey and Uganda. He recently ventured as far as Zimbabwe to embrace Robert Mugabe. In the past year or so his African trips have taken in Gambia, Kenya, Senegal and Uganda, among other places, presumably offering generous oil deals that few can resist in return for backing. He has also invited North Korea&#8217;s reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, to Tehran, his capital. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some governments, notably those of Brazil and Turkey, have declared their support for Iran&#8217;s right to peaceful nuclear technology. He is particularly cosy with Hugo Ch\xE1vez, Venezuela&#8217;s America-baiting leader, whom the Iranian president has called &#8220;my valiant brother&#8230;who is resisting like a mountain the intentions of imperialism and colonialism.&#8221; Mr Ahmadinejad has also visited Bolivia, where he hugged its populist leader, Evo Morales.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet it is far from clear that Mr Ahmadinejad has made any lasting new friends. Brazil, for instance, wants to help mediate Iran&#8217;s nuclear dispute, and its president, Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, is due to visit Iran later this month. But Iran&#8217;s response to Brazil&#8217;s offer to serve as a neutral repository for Iran&#8217;s stocks of enriched fuel as part of an attempt to revive a mooted solution to the nuclear stalemate has been vague. After meeting Iran&#8217;s foreign minister, his Austrian and Bosnian counterparts reiterated their intention to support new sanctions. Mr Mugabe cheerily waved his fist for the cameras alongside Mr Ahmadinejad, but a spokesman for Morgan Tsvangirai&#8217;s party, which is in a unity government with Mr Mugabe&#8217;s one, called Iran&#8217;s president a &#8220;warmonger, a trampler of human rights, an executioner.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The Arabs aren&#8217;t quite so amenable</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The small Arab states of the Gulf, increasingly alarmed by repeated Iranian military and naval exercises, are therefore furiously arming themselves with fancy new weaponry. Kuwait recently said it would investigate a suspected spy network allegedly linked to Iran. And the continuing crackdown on internal dissent by Mr Ahmadinejad&#8217;s government does little to improve Iran&#8217;s image, especially in the Middle East. Oddly for a government that professes to support nuclear disarmament, it recently barred one of its own leaders, Muhammad Khatami, a former Iranian president, from travelling to a conference in Hiroshima on that very subject.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Tap that water</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Controversy surrounds the argument for dam-building in Africa</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | NAIROBI | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AFRICA is the &#8220;underdammed&#8221; continent. It is the least irrigated and electrified, yet it uses only 3% of its renewable water, against 52% in South Asia. So there is plenty of scope for an African dam-building boom. Ghana long ago dammed the River Volta, Egypt the Nile, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique the Zambezi. But there are new projects aplenty.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Sudan&#8217;s president, Omar al-Bashir, for instance, is so proud of the new Merowe dam in the north of his country that he made it a selling-point in his recent election campaign. Costing $1.8 billion, it will produce 1,250 megawatts and create a lake 174km (108 miles) long, above the Nile&#8217;s fourth cataract. If all goes well, it may even fulfil an old dream to irrigate swathes of farmland in northern Sudan, while sending electricity to run the thirsty air-conditioners of Khartoum. And all without dirtying the atmosphere, once the dams have been built. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China is building most of Africa&#8217;s new dams out of its own pocket, with all sorts of hoped-for spin-offs. International Rivers, a lobby that tries to save rivers from dams it says are destructive, admits that the Chinese are much greener these days. China Eximbank cancelled a loan for a dam in Gabon on environmental grounds. Even so, political instability, graft and incompetence have meant that many African dams, once built, have failed to produce what was promised. The Inga I and II dams on the Congo river have generated a fraction of the power they were meant to. The technology is demanding. Seasonal rains produce muddy rivers, with higher sedimentation than northern countries&#8217; dams filled with melted snow. That means a shorter lifespan and heavier maintenance. Angola has spent $400m overhauling its dams and transmission lines. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The standards set in 2000 by the World Commission on Dams, an independent body which brought together an array of experts from all sides of the argument and which recognises dams&#8217; local costs as well as national benefits, are often ignored in Africa. Projects are rushed. Huge contracts are open to corruption. Engineering can be shoddy, leading to cost overruns.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The hardest bit is hydrology. Rainfall estimates are often wrong. Some countries must rent costly diesel generators to boost hydropower in years of drought. Climate change makes hydrology trickier still. Reservoir water sometimes falls too low to turn the turbines. Schemes to export power need to speed regional integration. Ethiopia and Egypt are again rowing over how to share the Nile waters. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The latest controversy surrounds Ethiopia&#8217;s colossal Gibe III dam. It is set to cost $2 billion and produce 1,800 megawatts, the same amount as South Africa&#8217;s Koeberg nuclear reactor. Ethiopia says it wants to dam itself into becoming an industrial country that exports electricity, rebranding itself &#8220;the water tower of Africa&#8221;, a title that should perhaps be shared with Congo and Guinea. Survival International, which lobbies for tribal people&#8217;s rights, says the livelihood and culture of 200,000 people in the Omo river basin could be ruined by Gibe III. The Ethiopian government, it argues, has behaved &#8220;criminally&#8221; in pushing through the project.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Salini Construttori, an Italian company that is building Gibe III, brushes off such charges. The campaigners, it says, have miscalculated the volume of water that the dam would retain. It says the water level of Lake Turkana, across the border in Kenya, would drop by 50cm, not the five metres or more that some claim. A measured release of water from the dam, say the builders, should let local people grow crops all the year round for the first time. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>So who will really take charge?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The long-ailing president&#8217;s death may provoke a fierce struggle for power</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | LAGOS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE death on May 5th of Nigeria&#8217;s president, Umaru Yar&#8217;Adua, marks the close of a peculiar period of drift for Africa&#8217;s most populous country. The 58-year-old leader had not appeared in public since last November. Nor had he fully handed over power. A battle for the succession, already under way, will heat up ahead of next year&#8217;s polls. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Yar&#8217;Adua left Nigeria for a clinic in Saudi Arabia last year, reportedly to be treated for a bad heart, having previously gone abroad because of a kidney ailment. Only a handful of his 150m compatriots, aside from his family and a few religious leaders, ever saw him again. He came home under cover of darkness in February, to be whisked away to the presidential villa. The exact cause of his death was not immediately known. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dogged by ill-health even before he took office in 2007, Mr Yar&#8217;Adua&#8217;s nickname, Baba Go-Slow, compared his sluggish pace of governance to the grinding traffic jams of Lagos, Nigeria&#8217;s financial capital. But he had some success. Last summer he arranged an amnesty for militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta. The deal has been fraying in his absence. He also oversaw banking reforms in sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s second-biggest economy. Some reckless executives were sacked. Others were hauled before court. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>While the president&#8217;s death is no shock, plotting and politicking for next year&#8217;s polls will intensify. The presidency rotates every two terms between the country&#8217;s largely Muslim north and its mostly Christian south, according to an unwritten code agreed to by the ruling People&#8217;s Democratic Party (PDP). Mr Yar&#8217;Adua died in his first four-year term. So a northerner is widely expected to emerge as the PDP candidate next year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Goodluck Jonathan, Mr Yar&#8217;Adua&#8217;s southern deputy, who became acting president in February as the country grew impatient, has already been sworn in and will soon appoint a vice-president, who may then be groomed as next year&#8217;s candidate. Some formidable northern names are already being mentioned. Aliyu Gusau, Mr Jonathan&#8217;s national security adviser, is one. To the horror of many Nigerians, Ibrahim Babangida, a former military ruler, has also expressed an interest in the PDP ticket. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But some northerners say Mr Jonathan should himself be considered, despite the customary system of rotation. Formerly rather passive, he appointed his own cabinet last month. He has promised to clean up Nigeria&#8217;s elections, improve its woeful electricity supply and deal with the unresolved insurgency in the Delta. He has yet to say whether he will run next year. There is much to play for. And many will play dirty.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The Dinka will decide whether Africa&#8217;s latest state-in-waiting fails or prospers</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | BOR | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE Anglican Bishop of Bor, Nathaniel Garang, sits under the little shade afforded by a thorn tree. His dusty compound has a few mud and straw huts, some plastic chairs, and goats reaching up to bare branches on their hind legs. The bishop is around 70, he guesses, and in reflective mood. He wears a small brass cross given to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Entering Canterbury cathedral, he remarks, was a special moment in his life.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Garang is a Dinka, the largest of south Sudan&#8217;s tribes. Specifically, he is a Bor Dinka (see map), the first of the Dinka groups to become Christian and be educated. Their historic missionary post, founded just upriver on the Nile in 1905, was burnt down during Sudan&#8217;s long civil war between the Arab and Muslim north and the Christian and animist south that ended only five years ago. The cathedral in Bor was also shot up, but still attracts several thousand worshippers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Garang attributes miracles in the war to the Dinka&#8217;s strong Christian faith. &#8220;We Dinka know the blood of animal sacrifice is very powerful, so the blood of Christ is easy for us to understand.&#8221; Will there be another war? Mr Garang shakes his head firmly. &#8220;This is a time of work, peace and resettlement.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In elections last month Omar al-Bashir, a northern Arab, easily retained the presidency of Sudan as a whole, especially since the main northern opposition boycotted the proceedings, while in the south the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement (SPLM), the former rebels&#8217; political wing, won hands down. The southerners now eagerly await a promised referendum on independence early next year. They are very likely to vote for secession. If allowed to, they will then create Africa&#8217;s first newly independent country since Eritrea in 1993. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In any event, the new state of South Sudan, whose official name has yet to be finally determined, will be dominated by the Dinka. Their politicians, their spending priorities, even their culture seem set to prevail. At least a quarter of south Sudan&#8217;s 9m people are Dinka. For two decades the southern rebels&#8217; leader was a Dinka, John Garang, a kinsman of the bishop. After his death in a helicopter crash in 2005, he was succeeded by another Dinka, Salva Kiir, who launched his recent election campaign from John Garang&#8217;s mausoleum. Like the Kikuyu in Kenya, the Dinka are often accused by the region&#8217;s other 40-plus tribes of tailoring South Sudan&#8217;s foundation story to suit their own ends.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The land of the Bor Dinka is vast and fertile but flat. When it rains, water stands in stagnant pools for months. People are stranded in the marshes from May to October with little communication to the outside world. The sorghum harvest depends on good rains. This year they have been late, so the harvest will be poor. Arable farming is unreliable and the Dinka are in any case devoted to cattle, which they still value even above schools and clean water. Children are named after the colour of cows. Marriages are negotiated in cows. Status in rural areas is determined by the number of cows you own. &#8220;The dream of a Dinka-dominated country would be everyone running naked in cattle camps,&#8221; says a seasoned observer in Juba, the would-be country&#8217;s fledgling capital.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But other southern tribes are equally devoted to their cattle. The Bor Dinka often fight the Nuer, the region&#8217;s second tribe, and particularly fear the Murle, a smaller pastoral lot who think nothing of raiding Dinka cattle byres close to Bor. The Dinka often disparage the Nuer as hotter-tempered and the Murle as mad. Dinka elders and some outsiders say the Murle are getting weapons and lorries from the old Arab enemy in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital. That claim has not yet been proven. But the northerners have long stirred up rivalry between the Dinka and other southern tribes in order to divide and rule. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some worry that, deprived of a common enemy in Khartoum, an independent south may descend into inter-ethnic warfare. Last year more than 2,500 people were killed and 400,000 displaced, mostly after cattle raids between the tribes. In 1991 the Nuer massacred Dinka civilians in Bor. Some Dinka say tens of thousands of women and children were killed. South Sudan&#8217;s vice-president, Riek Machar, a Nuer who was in charge of the attack, says the Dinka exaggerate. Officials in Bor, all of whom are Dinka, say the massacre has been forgiven but not forgotten. Mr Machar reconciled himself with the SPLM&#8217;s Dinka leadership only in 2002. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Kiir knows Dinka-Nuer rivalry could again turn violent and that, to lessen the risk, he must hand more power to the Nuer and the Equatorians (in the southernmost strip bordering Uganda) in a more federal arrangement. So far he has sought to buy off the malcontents. But resentment has been building up. The army is a shambles. Dinka complain that ill-qualified Nuer are being over-promoted. Non-Dinka hiss that the Dinka have a lock on the most lucrative posts. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If South Sudan is to prosper, the Dinka will not only have to share power but also perform a lot more efficiently themselves. Since the war ended, 2m southerners have returned to their homes. Four times as many children are going to school than before. But the administration in Juba is chaotic. Many millions of dollars of foreign aid have already gone astray. There is barely 50km (30 miles) of tarmac road in the entire region. Crucial contracts have yet to be signed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dinka ministers in Juba talk grandly of bringing in tractors and turning virgin land into a breadbasket. But who will drive the tractors or plant the crops? By tradition, Dinka men despise manual labour and few have mechanical skills. Most of the people in Bor who do the real work are Ugandan and Ethiopian. &#8220;Work is not our strong point,&#8221; admits a Dinka official. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The sad end of the party</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Greeks greet another government austerity plan, and an IMF/EU rescue package, with riots and violence</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | ATHENS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE headlines this week were about riots, petrol bombs, tear gas and strikes. In Athens demonstrators stormed up to the steps of the parliament building, where an austerity plan was about to be debated, calling on the parliamentary &#8220;thieves&#8221; to come out. Three people were killed when protesters set fire to a bank. Hours later, with tear gas drifting over the adjacent square, parliamentary leaders held a brief, sombre exchange on the significance of the deaths, vowing to sustain the principle that protest must be peaceful. Many citizens agreed that it was a sad moment for the birthplace of democracy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Yet Athenians were also saying, with wistful smiles, that, for the past ten years or so, it had been a good party. For the backdrop to the riots was that, in a mixed mood of resignation, black humour and bitterness, Greeks were bidding farewell to a decade in which everything good and bad about their country grew feverishly as money washed over it. There were sporting and cultural extravaganzas, starting with the 2004 Olympics. Archaeological sites were spruced up, spanking new buildings erected. The middle class grew larger and more sophisticated. And many people at the bottom of the pile breathed a bit easier, if only because immigrants from poorer places came to harvest their olives and work in their restaurants.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> At the same time Greece&#8217;s worst habits&#8212;the plundering of state coffers, the hiring of cronies, the abuse of public office, impunity for the powerful&#8212;were multiplying. A handful of Cassandras said it would all end in tears but, while the party lasted, nobody listened. Now, with the news on May 2nd of loans from the IMF and the European Union worth a total of &#8364;110 billion ($145 billion), plus an austerity plan, the party is well and truly over.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indeed, this week&#8217;s riots will usher in what promises to be the rockiest period in the recent history of Greece. By slashing pay in the public sector, raising taxes and (hesitantly) starting to reform the labour market, the plan is to cut the budget deficit from 13.6% of GDP in 2009 to less than 3% by 2014. But it will deepen the recession that is already hitting Greece, with the drop in GDP in 2010 now expected to be at least 4% and a further fall forecast for 2011 (see chart). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> George Papandreou, Greece&#8217;s Socialist prime minister, can count on a degree of understanding from half the electorate (not all of them voters for his party) that the country faces a make-or-break moment in which wrenching change is the only alternative to outright disaster. He can also take comfort because the centre-right opposition, New Democracy, is in quarrelsome disarray as the full extent of its mismanagement in 2004-09 becomes obvious. But will that be enough? Even those who accept that Greece&#8217;s problems are largely self-made are depressed by an austerity plan that seems to offer so little hope for the medium term, and will punish many hard-working and modestly paid ordinary Greeks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And there is a hotheaded minority, at least, that does not believe the government when it says it had no choice. Mikis Theodorakis, Greece&#8217;s most famous composer, expressed the visceral reaction of many when he said the crisis was probably a plot by dark forces in America and other capitalist centres to subdue proud, independent nations. Crazy as such talk may sound to euro-zone governments that believe they have strained every muscle to save Greece from collapse, it will convince some people in a country where conspiracy theories (and, indeed, conspiracies) have a long history.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Greek politics still includes a Communist Party that is rigorously Stalinist (it damns Khrushchev as a liberal backslider) and commands some 8% of the vote. There is an emerging party of religious-nationalist far-rightists under the acronym LAOS (the Greek word for people), which has tried to gain respectability by accepting the need for tough measures, but still stands to gain from the ferment. So do groups of malcontents even further removed from the political mainstream. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Not for the first time, the IMF and the EU will be cast as lightning-rods for xenophobic anger. In the radical press and on the internet, the IMF is already being called a junta, comparable to the colonels who took power in 1967 with the connivance (most Greeks believe) of the United States. That Greece invoked IMF help in late April, just after the anniversary of the April 21st 1967 coup, is seen by some in the Helleno-blogosphere as confirmation that the country faces a new period of foreign-backed despotism. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Such talk resonates in Greece. Throughout its 200-year history, the role of foreign powers has generated red-hot passion. Protagonists in Greece&#8217;s internal quarrels have long invoked external assistance, while furiously denouncing any foreign help given to their rivals. During the right-left civil war of 1946-49, each side reserved particular loathing for its foe&#8217;s foreign backers, American or Soviet. Dimitris Livanios, a historian, says that the idea of a manipulating &#8220;foreign finger&#8221; is a recurring motif in Greek affairs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The unprecedented prosperity enjoyed by most Greeks during the past decade helped to disguise some sentiments that were never far below the surface: ultra-leftism (including the violent sort which spills over into terrorism), ultra-nationalism and xenophobia. Such feelings may now be unleashed. The government claims some successes in rounding up a small ultra-leftist group of urban guerrillas called &#8220;Revolutionary Struggle&#8221;. But there are palpable fears that austerity and riots will now spawn a new generation of self-styled Robin Hoods practising both political and criminal violence.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, cooler-headed Greeks are racking their brains for ways to regain the economy&#8217;s lost competitiveness and make better use of Greece&#8217;s abundant human and natural assets. Much of the growth over the past decade reflected the windfall of cheap euro interest rates, which stoked an exuberant consumer market, complete with smart cars, foreign travel and personal trainers. All this will contract sharply now.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> What about tourism, Greece&#8217;s mainstay? Some Greek islands have been overbuilt by Athenians taking advantage of corrupt planning laws, but all over the mainland there are villages in beautiful settings that are decaying for want of anybody ready to refit handsome stone houses and attract year-round visitors. There, at least, is an opportunity. But there can be no devaluation to make Greece a newly cheap destination, and harsh new taxes on business included in the government&#8217;s austerity plan may kill the entrepreneurial spirit of those bold enough to try new things. New taxes on business and property will also limit the attractiveness of state assets that the government may want to sell to raise revenue, notes Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> There is also a well-founded suspicion that light-fingered bureaucrats and greedy politicians, the very people who caused the crisis, should be held to account but won&#8217;t be. President Carolos Papoulias, a soft-spoken leftist whose office is meant to be above politics, reacted to the austerity plan with a one-sentence call for people who robbed the state coffers to be punished. Many agreed. &#8220;The wage and spending cuts will be implemented with great efficiency, but with our chaotic justice system, the pursuit of tax-dodgers and bribe-takers will just run into the sand,&#8221; predicted an Athenian architect.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all very well for Papandreou to compare himself to Odysseus making a long, heroic voyage,&#8221; read one electronic message doing the rounds between Athenian offices this week. &#8220;But Odysseus had a miserable journey and lost all his companions. And he washed up on Ithaca without any clothes on.&#8221; At street level, sentiments are even less poetic. &#8220;We do not recognise this debt,&#8221; was the slogan of the militant trade unions, from teachers to dockers, that went on strike this week. The number of Greeks who believe in Bolshevik-style autarky may be small. But the idea of working hard for years just to win an IMF/EU certificate of good behaviour holds little appeal. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Either in fear or in hope, many Greeks detect a breakdown of a political system, over a century old, in which two political groups (notionally of the centre-left and the centre-right, but both given to patronage and graft) progressively exhaust the national exchequer by outbidding each other. After the post-party riots, it is anybody&#8217;s guess what might take its place. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Greased up</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The region may share in some of Greece&#8217;s pain</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AVERTING a meltdown in Greece, at least temporarily, is good news for that country&#8217;s fragile ex-communist neighbours. Their big worry is Greek-owned banks, which account for as much as a quarter of banking assets in Bulgaria, some 15% in Romania and a tenth in Serbia. These institutions have been facing potential runs by depositors, as worries have grown over Greece&#8217;s solvency and thus over the Greek banks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The financial authorities in some nearby countries had already imposed emergency-notification rules to delay (and if necessary to prevent) local banks from being drained dry by cash-hungry headquarters in Athens. The bail-out from the IMF and the European Union includes &#8364;10 billion ($13 billion) in recapitalisation for Greece&#8217;s banks, and adds a condition about keeping their foreign subsidiaries alive and lending. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This echoes the efforts made last year to bolster foreign-owned banks&#8217; confidence in central and eastern Europe and stop them from pulling out in panic. In that process, as it happens, Greece was particularly unhelpful. Outside advisers have been pressing the IMF and other lenders to make sure that the authorities in Athens behave differently this time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Any further tightening of credit in Greece&#8217;s region is unlikely to be too severe. Other foreign banks may expand their market share as Greek-owned rivals contract. But Greece is not just a provider of capital, it is also a big export market (taking a tenth of Bulgaria&#8217;s exports last year). And Greece employs plenty of migrants, especially from Albania, where remittances make up about a sixth of GDP. A deep recession in Greece will surely dent both growth and confidence in its northern neighbours. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet some think that the troubles in Greece may also provide a welcome refutation of the notion that Europe&#8217;s big divide is between a feckless ex-communist east and a virtuous old capitalist west; it is, rather, between a prudent north and a profligate south. In July Estonia expects the go-ahead to adopt the euro in 2011. With no net public debt, a deficit of 1.7% of GDP and 1.7% inflation, Estonia meets the Maastricht criteria better than any existing member. But nerves may yet trump logic. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Enthusiasm for enlargement is cooling. Any country with Greek levels of debt and hubris (eg, Hungary under its cocksure new government) will meet a particularly chilly welcome. And the sight of Greece&#8217;s agonies may make others, especially larger countries such as Poland, think again about the single currency&#8217;s advantages. In a crisis being able to devalue and to control your own monetary policy can prove an advantage. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Crooked in Calabria</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The toughest and nastiest gangs in Italy</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | ROME | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> WITH a more easily pronounceable name, the &#8217;Ndrangheta, the mafia of Calabria, Italy&#8217;s toe, might have achieved greater notoriety. Police and prosecutors began warning as far back as the 1990s that it had become the country&#8217;s richest, most dangerous organised-crime syndicate, ahead of Sicily&#8217;s Cosa Nostra. Yet although a third group, the Camorra in and around Naples, has become infamous thanks to Roberto Saviano&#8217;s best-selling book &#8220;Gomorrah&#8221;, the &#8217;Ndrangheta remains almost unknown beyond Italy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Investigators say that the &#8217;Ndrangheta has prospered largely because its links to the Colombian cartels have given it a pre-eminent role in the transatlantic cocaine trade. The man credited with forging those links is Roberto Pannunzi. Last month, it emerged that the Italian authorities had let him slip away&#8212;for a second time. He was first arrested in Medell\xEDn, Colombia, in 1994, when his captors refused his offer of &#8220;a million dollars, right now&#8221;. Extradited to Italy, he was let go when his detention order expired. Mr Pannunzi was then rearrested in 2004 and later convicted. But last year, after a heart attack, he was sent from jail to a private clinic near Rome. In March he disappeared. The news was kept quiet for more than three weeks, ostensibly so as not to obstruct his recapture.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> On April 26th the state was partly compensated by the arrest of Giovanni Tegano, reputedly the most senior gangster in the regional capital, Reggio Calabria. He was a key participant in Italy&#8217;s bloodiest-ever mafia war, which claimed the lives of almost 600 people in the six years to 1991. The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, acclaimed &#8220;the heaviest blow that could have been inflicted on the &#8217;Ndrangheta.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But official rejoicing was tempered when a crowd of 500 formed outside the police station where Mr Tegano had been taken and burst into applause when he emerged. Some shouted that the police had arrested a &#8220;man of peace.&#8221; Many in the crowd were reportedly related to the 70-year-old mobster, but the incident still shows the grip that the &#8217;Ndrangheta has on Calabria, which is one of Italy&#8217;s poorest regions. Reggio&#8217;s deputy chief prosecutor, Michele Prestipino, argues that it could yet be prised open. Bugged telephone calls showed mobsters lamenting a &#8220;certain intolerance&#8221; among those they extorted and terrorised, he said. But there has been nothing like the brave revolt by some Sicilian businessmen.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The day Mr Tegano was seized, police in Rosarno began an operation to dismantle a system of grossly exploitative agricultural work and the clan thought to be behind it. In January Rosarno saw a riot by African crop-pickers and violent reprisals by local people, some allegedly linked to the Pesce clan of the &#8217;Ndrangheta. Of 40 suspected members and associates, seven were women. They have long played a prominent role in the &#8217;Ndrangheta, partly because (unlike Cosa Nostra) the &#8217;Ndrangheta&#8217;s &#8220;families&#8221; are based on actual families. This makes them harder to infiltrate and so less susceptible to <em>pentitismo</em> (mobsters turning state&#8217;s evidence), which has proved a crucially important weapon in the fight against Cosa Nostra.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The countervailing drawback has often been disunity. If Cosa Nostra was a pyramid, the &#8217;Ndrangheta was more of an archipelago of similar but separate islands. That may be changing. The newspaper <em>La Repubblica</em> reports that police recently listened in on conversations in which &#8217;Ndrangheta affiliates were heard for the first time speaking of it as a unified structure. One, echoing the language of its Sicilian counterpart, declared: &#8220;We are all one thing. We are the &#8217;Ndrangheta.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A coalition kaleidoscope</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A state election that could profoundly affect the government in Berlin</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | BONN AND ESSEN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>J\xDCRGEN R\xDCTTGERS is one of Germany&#8217;s big guns. He is premier of its most populous state and social conscience of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). He would like to be president. Yet he is now battling to stay in office. On May 9th voters in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) will decide whether to re-elect him as premier and extend his party&#8217;s partnership with the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), the same coalition that governs Germany from Berlin. A no on either count would rattle Chancellor Angela Merkel. If Mr R\xFCttgers survives but changes partners, he may even present Germany with a model for its next federal government. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr R\xFCttgers took over NRW in 2005 after 39 years of rule by the Social Democratic Party (SPD). His government steadied the state&#8217;s finances, slashed bureaucracy and invested in education. By denouncing unfettered capitalism and advocating more generous welfare benefits, he occupied political ground that normally belongs to the SPD. Mr R\xFCttgers sees himself as a <em>Landesvater</em>, a kindly patriarch of his sprawling state of 18m. His chilly public persona is an impediment, but he is working on it. His campaign features hokey &#8220;evenings with Angelika and J\xFCrgen R\xFCttgers&#8221; at which voters learn that he haunts DIY shops on holiday in France.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Two misfortunes have transformed a walkover into a race. First came stumbles by Mrs Merkel&#8217;s coalition government, elected last September. Its credibility was damaged by the FDP&#8217;s insistence on tax cuts that most voters (and many in the CDU) think are unaffordable. Guido Westerwelle, who is both foreign minister and FDP leader, issues tirades on welfare dependency rather than showing the gravitas expected of a statesman. &#8220;This is a teach-them-a-lesson election,&#8221; says Volker Kronenberg, a political scientist and biographer of Mr R\xFCttgers. The second trouble was news that the CDU had offered sponsors meetings with Mr R\xFCttgers in exchange for campaign contributions. He had no idea, he says. But the aspiring <em>Landesvater</em> was mocked as &#8220;Rent-a-R\xFCttgers&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The setback that, against expectations, has not yet struck is Greece. Mrs Merkel is accused of stalling a bail-out to avoid angering NRW&#8217;s voters. Germans are dismayed but, says Britta Altenkamp, an SPD member of the state legislature from Essen, they know &#8220;they can&#8217;t have much influence&#8221; over such issues in a mere state poll. Jobs, education and local budget crises matter more to voters in the state. But the mood may be changing. The SPD is threatening to withhold support from the bail-out package in the Bundestag. That may prove popular in NRW. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The result in nrw may make governing Germany harder. A loss of the state would erase Mrs Merkel&#8217;s majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house in Berlin. She would need help from the opposition to pass key legislation, including tax cuts and health-care reforms. Defeat could sober the FDP but might also sharpen its aggression, further souring its already snippy relationship with the CDU. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Much depends on what sort of defeat voters inflict on Mr R\xFCttgers&#8217;s coalition. If he were ousted by Hannelore Kraft, the SPD&#8217;s leader, that would be an ominous sign for Mrs Merkel&#8212;a chancellor&#8217;s undoing often begins with defeats in the states. But it looks unlikely, unless the SPD takes the risk of including the ex-communist Left Party in a coalition. Despite Mr R\xFCttgers&#8217;s troubles, the CDU remains ahead in the polls. The real question may be which party replaces the liberals in his coalition. It could be the SPD itself. Such &#8220;grand coalitions&#8221; are ungainly but not uncommon (Mrs Merkel herself led one in Berlin until last year). Or Mr R\xFCttgers could make history by forming the first coalition between the CDU and the Greens in a big state. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This would be an awkward pairing. The Greens were formed in reaction to the small-town, middle-class values embodied by the CDU (and by Mr R\xFCttgers, an electrician&#8217;s son). They are at odds on energy and education. The CDU defends the traditional three-tier system in which children are separated by ability at age ten; the Greens want them to spend more time in the same schools. Mr R\xFCttgers introduced tuition fees for universities; the Greens want them scrapped. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the gap is narrowing. The Greens want to expand their range of possible partners beyond the SPD (in Hamburg, a small state, they already rule with the CDU). The CDU is striving to be modern on women and minorities. Recently the two parties have been &#8220;knowingly romancing each other,&#8221; says Ingolfur Bl\xFChdorn of the University of Bath. Differences on education and tuition are bridgeable. NRW has been a laboratory for coalitions later tried at federal level. If Mr R\xFCttgers joins with the Greens, he may be seen not as a loser but as a pioneer. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Many wives' tales</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A surprisingly prevalent phenomenon</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN police stopped a woman driving with a full face-covering Islamic veil, little did they know what they would uncover. It turned out that her husband, a halal butcher, practised polygamy, which is illegal in France&#8212;or, rather, he was living with four women, one of whom he was married to. Brice Hortefeux, the interior minister, wildly overreacted, demanding that he be stripped of his French nationality. The affair has exposed both the reality of polygamy and the difficulty of doing anything about it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>France considers polygamy &#8220;a grave infringement of the principle of equality between men and women&#8221;. The practice was forbidden in 1993, when immigration laws were tightened to stop husbands bringing extra wives into the country. Yet there are an estimated 200,000 people, including children, living in 16,000-20,000 polygamous families in France. Most are of African origin, particularly from Muslim parts of the Maghreb and Sahel, where polygamy is accepted.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over the years, notes Sonia Imloul in a study for the Institut Montaigne, a think-tank, the authorities have turned a blind eye to what she calls life &#8220;like a prison for the wives&#8221;, many of them forced into marriage. Polygamy is widely blamed for social ills ranging from school absenteeism to street violence. Politicians say it is exploited to maximise welfare and housing benefits. Such fraud is hard to detect, since polygamists &#8220;marry&#8221; various wives under Islam, all of them claiming single-parent payments, while officially being married to just one.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In a comic twist, Lies Hebbadj, the husband who came under attack from Mr Hortefeux, tried to turn his case against his accusers by declaring that &#8220;if one is stripped of French nationality because one has mistresses, then many Frenchmen could be.&#8221; The French official organisation representing Muslims this week denounced Mr Hebbadj&#8217;s comments as &#8220;offensive and insulting&#8221; to Islam, stressing that it recognises only official marriages. Even so Eric Besson, the immigration minister, concedes that there are unlikely to be any grounds for stripping Mr Hebbadj of his French nationality without changing the law.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Women&#8217;s-rights lobbies have welcomed this debate. Chantal Brunel, a deputy from Nicolas Sarkozy&#8217;s ruling UMP party, and a campaigner against domestic violence, describes wives in polygamous marriages as living in &#8220;semi-slavery&#8221;, subject to violence, and their daughters to female circumcision. France is keen on classic women&#8217;s issues, she observes, such as equal pay and promotion at work, or women on corporate boards (see ), but less interested in the grim reality of polygamy on French soil. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A Balkan imbroglio</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>How a drug-smuggling episode is creating new Balkan tensions</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | PODGORICA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>LATE last year, in an operation dubbed &#8220;Balkan Warrior&#8221;, police in South America seized 2.7 tonnes of cocaine, most of it from a yacht moored in Uruguay. Almost six months on, the reverberations are being felt on the other side of the world. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Serbia has indicted Darko Saric and 19 associates, accusing them of smuggling drugs from South America to Europe. Mr Saric hails from Pljevlja, in Montenegro, but is a Serbian citizen. The Serbs have confiscated more than 25 properties which they claim belong to him or to his associates. The Serbian government is trumpeting this as a crackdown on organised crime. But the Balkan Warrior story is now damaging relations between Serbia and Montenegro, which became independent only in 2006.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In February the Serbs asked the Montenegrins to arrest and extradite three alleged gang members. But when Serbia did not provide any evidence against them, they were released. Montenegrin officials say they are the victims of a Serbian smear campaign. Montenegro is way ahead of Serbia in progress towards joining the European Union. It may even win formal candidate status by the end of 2010. The Montenegrins suggest that Serbia is now using the Saric affair to blacken Montenegro&#8217;s name in Brussels.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Saric has vanished. Nebojsa Medojevic, a Montenegrin opposition leader, who has often accused Milo Djukanovic, the prime minister, of tolerating organised crime (he in turn has accused critics of being criminals and drug addicts) believes Mr Saric is still in the country but has been kidnapped by bigger crime bosses to stop him talking. Now <em>Monitor</em>, a Montenegrin magazine, claims to have seen leaked documents showing unusual financial activities in companies linked to Mr Saric. According to the documents, millions of euros have been paid by companies registered in the Marshall Islands and in Delaware via the Bank of Cyprus into accounts at an Austrian bank, Hypo Alpe Adria, in Montenegro. The companies are all owned by people with links to Mr Saric. The magazine claims the money is being used as collateral for bank loans to other companies with connections to Mr Saric. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a statement, Hypo Alpe Adria says that these transactions have been reported to Montenegro&#8217;s anti-money-laundering agency. The bank claims it is not laundering money, but the agency&#8217;s director, Predrag Mitrovic, says the transactions look suspicious. Igor Luksic, Montenegro&#8217;s finance minister, says the authorities are investigating them. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Saric affair has hit the reputation of Montenegro at a bad moment for the economy. GDP grew by 10.7% in 2007 and 7.5% in 2008. But Mr Luksic says it shrank by 5.3% in 2009 and will barely grow this year. Mr Djukanovic&#8217;s ruling Democratic Party of Socialists may suffer politically. In local elections later this month, the main opposition parties will stand together for the first time since independence. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> If the opposition parties do well, they will demand a general election. Mr Luksic, who is widely seen as a possible successor if Mr Djukanovic steps down (as he has repeatedly promised), perhaps next year, is against that. He suggests one bright way to lift the gloom: to persuade Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire former Thai prime minister who has now become a citizen of Montenegro, to invest. We are rich in opportunities, Mr Luksic insists. But before most foreign investors will be prepared to take any of them up, his country needs to do more to improve its reputation.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Zagreb wars</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The problems caused when two leaders fall out</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | ZAGREB | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS war, says Nino Djula, editor of <em>Globus</em>, a Croatian weekly. Croatia has plenty of war to talk about: its part in the Bosnian wars, a war against corruption, trouble with the UN war-crimes tribunal in The Hague. But the war Mr Djula refers to is an outbreak of vicious hostility between the president, Ivo Josipovic, and the prime minister, Jadranka Kosor. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When Mr Josipovic was elected in January he was seen as a nice, inoffensive lawyer. To voters, his main virtue lay in never having held high office, which was taken as a sign that he was not corrupt. A Social Democrat, he was also expected to build bridges to Mrs Kosor, who comes from the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). That expectation has proved false. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The latest fallout between the two came when Mr Josipovic went to the Bosnian parliament last month to express regret for Croatia&#8217;s role in the Bosnian war. This had led to human suffering and divisions that still plague us today, he said. Many might consider such words uncontroversial, but the HDZ reacted furiously. The party has reformed itself, but many grandees remain loyal to the memory of its founder (and the country&#8217;s wartime leader), Franjo Tudjman. Mrs Kosor complained that the president should make foreign policy with the government, not by himself. He responded by demanding that she show he had breached the constitution or resign. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Later in April both leaders attended a memorial ceremony at Jasenovac, Croatia&#8217;s second-world-war death camp, in which Serbs, Jews, Roma and undesirable Croats were murdered. Mr Josipovic was cheered but Mrs Kosor was jeered. She said bitterly that this was organised. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Croatia hopes to finish its European Union membership negotiations by the end of the year, so it can join in 2012. Yet the UN war-crimes tribunal could still be an obstacle. Its chief prosecutor thinks Croatia is not doing enough to find missing documents (a charge the Croats deny). As with other Balkan countries, a negative opinion from The Hague may delay or block EU accession. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If the government cannot give people good news about the EU and the economy remains creaky, that would be bad for Mrs Kosor, who faces an election in 2011. When she came to power in July 2009 her popularity soared. Now it is falling, while Mr Josipovic&#8217;s is rising. In March a former deputy prime minister from HDZ was arrested on corruption charges. Mr Josipovic hopes more arrests will follow. This war will go on. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The euro's existential worries</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>What lies behind differences over the future of the euro</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WILL the euro still exist in 10 years&#8217; time? That is a trickier question to answer than it was three months ago, when European Union leaders first lined up in Brussels to wag their fingers at the markets and offer vague declarations of &#8220;solidarity&#8221; with Greece in its hour of fiscal need. The political will to preserve the euro should not be underestimated, any more than was the political will to create it. Indeed, EU resolve has strengthened since February. But the crisis has worsened even faster. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is anger in Brussels that it took until May 2nd for the euro-zone countries to put real money on the table: &#8364;80 billion ($105 billion) to meet Greece&#8217;s borrowing needs, topped up by &#8364;30 billion from the IMF. Senior officials blame Germany for the delay. They concede that Angela Merkel, Germany&#8217;s chancellor, has a defence: Greece would never have agreed to such an ambitious austerity plan if the bail-out had come sooner. Fine, the officials retort; but rescuing Greece only at the last possible moment before default has raised the cost by billions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Around Brussels, there is much muttering about German selfishness and even nationalism. When it comes to existential questions about the euro, conventional EU wisdom also has an answer: that the single currency faces either &#8220;integration or disintegration.&#8221; By this, EU types mean that national governments must choose between doom and surrendering big new chunks of sovereignty over their budgets.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Euro-optimists argue that the bail-out for Greece is the first step towards a &#8220;fiscal union&#8221; in which stricter rules on budget discipline, backed by painful sanctions, would be offset by bigger transfers from thriftier to wobblier members of the club. Euro-pessimists mutter that Mrs Merkel seems more interested in punishing the profligate than in European solidarity. They point to her call to remove voting rights from spendthrift euro-zone members and for the orderly insolvency of the worst offenders.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The &#8220;integration v disintegration&#8221; argument is logical and neat. But it is also wrong. Or rather, it is a distraction to judge the euro crisis as a tussle between those clinging to national interests and those ready to centralise more power in the EU.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Deep down, tensions inside the euro-zone involve clashing social contracts and democratic preferences. Post-war German governments have won voters&#8217; consent by offering thrift and monetary stability (a comfort for Germans with a folk memory of life savings lost to hyperinflation), plus an elaborately consensual capitalism. Greek governments have instead spent years buying social peace and votes with public spending, generous pensions, tax breaks, EU money and jobs for life, directed to an array of rent-seeking interest groups. This sort of social contract, lubricated by endemic corruption and lax law-enforcement, has evolved to suit a country emerging from a vile civil war and years of dictatorship in which consensus was painfully absent.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Unfortunately the Greek model has proved itself unsustainable. So Greece&#8217;s euro-zone partners, starting with Germany, are being asked to lend huge sums in the name of EU solidarity and peace on the streets of Athens. And that is genuinely hard. German voters, egged on by xenophobic tabloid headlines, do not want to pay for the Greek social contract. Moreover, bailing out a profligate member of the euro-zone breaches a German government pledge to its own voters: that the euro would be as solid as the D-mark. That leaves Germany forced to choose between two bedrock principles in its own social contract: economic stability and EU integration.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Amid voter hostility, Austria&#8217;s deputy chancellor and finance minister, Josef Pr\xF6ll, said this week that Europe was &#8220;almost out of patience&#8221; with Greek street protests against austerity. The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, said he would believe in Greek austerity plans only when he saw them enacted, declaring: &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust the Greeks.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet IMF-drafted austerity plans also feel like a breach of contract for many ordinary Greeks, even those repelled when violence claims lives in Athens. Cutting civil-service pay seems unfair to officials who earn a pittance. Collecting more taxes may be vital, but will anger Greeks who must endure poor public services, pay bribes to secure decent hospital care and fork out for private tutors to help children betrayed by failing schools. The coming weeks will test whether Greece can change its social contract in ways that will render its economy sustainable. If it cannot, the Greek bushfire will spread. Above all, EU officials fear contagion spreading to Spain, a much bigger economy.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Behavioural science</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Changing behaviour was always part of the euro project. Mario Monti, twice an Italian EU commissioner, wanted his country to join the euro precisely so that it would be forced into a more Germanic view of borrowing and spending, and stop robbing future generations to pay today&#8217;s interest groups. &#8220;I thought the euro would change Italian culture, and it did,&#8221; he says. Italy&#8217;s public debt may be high, but it has become more careful about deficits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Senior Eurocrats insist they are not about to propose fiscal transfers within a single economic union. That is &#8220;not the logic&#8221; of their plans, says one. The focus is on rules and peer pressure. On May 12th the European Commission will unveil plans for more intrusive surveillance of national budgets, with tougher rules to enforce discipline.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the euro will not be saved by rules alone. If the currency is to survive, the democratic instincts of Europeans who use it must align more closely. That is exceptionally hard to arrange. But here is a blunt truth: EU governments are not about to pool their national budgets. A convergence of social contracts&#8212;getting Greeks to behave more like Germans&#8212;may be the euro&#8217;s best hope.</p>\r\n\

    <h1>How it went on the day</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>An extraordinary election seems likely to make David Cameron prime minister</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 7th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DAVID CAMERON is on course to replace Gordon Brown as Britain&#8217;s prime minister. For all the ambiguities of the general-election result, which began to unfold on May 6th, that much seems apparent. But exactly what type of government the Conservative leader will front, and how long it will last, is still unclear.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As <em>The Economist</em> went to press, the Tories looked set to end up with something over 300 MPs&#8212;more than any other party, but not enough for an overall majority in the House of Commons. Mr Brown&#8217;s Labour Party was poised to fall by 90 or so seats to less than 260, a result that will almost certainly bring to an end his premiership and extraordinary political career. It is conceivable that Labour could strike some kind of deal with Nick Clegg&#8217;s Liberal Democrats (who look likely to lose a few of the 62 seats they held before) to remain in office. By constitutional principle Mr Brown has the first shot at forming a government; yet the national mood is palpably set against him. And even added together, Labour and the Lib Dems would probably fall as far short of the 326 seats needed for a majority as the Tories themselves will do. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indeed, the biggest shock of the night was the Lib Dems&#8217; disappointing performance. The third party had surged in the polls after the first televised debate among the prime ministerial candidates three weeks ago, when Mr Clegg shone. Their new-found popularity turned out to be chimerical. The party did well where it always does, in its south-western heartland, but made little progress elsewhere.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Worst of all, in the chaotic hours during which politicians and commentators alike were struggling to discern any real pattern in the results, were troubling stories of electoral irregularities across the country. Some voters, it seems, were turned away by polling stations ill prepared to cope with a turnout that was higher than usual. The Electoral Commission, an independent body, expressed grave concerns, as did all the party leaders. There have been suggestions that voters denied a voice might launch legal challenges. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In other ways too it was a topsy-turvily eventful night. Peter Robinson, the scandal-hit first minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionists, lost his East Belfast seat to the nonsectarian Alliance Party. Some high-profile culprits of last year&#8217;s parliamentary-expenses scandal were evicted from their constituencies, such as Jacqui Smith, the former home secretary. But fringe parties such as the right-wing British National Party and the anti-Europe UK Independence Party did not make much headway against the mainstream forces (though the Greens made history in getting their first MP elected). Esther Rantzen, a celebrity candidate running in a seat whose previous incumbent had been among the most egregious expense-fiddlers, won a humiliatingly small number of votes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But results varied hugely across the country. The Tories won spectacular swings in the south of England, and often meagre ones, or none at all, elsewhere. And even within regions, results differed wildly&#8212;the Tories failed to take London seats such as Hammersmith and Westminster North, where they had made huge efforts, but did well in others. Similarly, the Lib Dems engineered epic victories in previously safe Labour seats such as Burnley and Redcar but flopped elsewhere in the north of England where they had hoped to make gains. The idea of a &#8220;uniform national swing&#8221;, on which so many polling projections were made, took a mauling. For all the talk of British politics becoming presidential, local issues and candidates seemed to be more important than ever. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But whatever the tales of the night itself, the story of the coming days (and, if it goes badly, the coming weeks) will be the manoeuvring to set up a new government. In the most likely scenario Mr Brown will take his leave relatively swiftly, after recognising that any efforts to prop himself up with Lib Dem support are likely to be hopeless. The queen would then invite Mr Cameron to try to form a government. He is likely to prefer to go it alone with a minority Tory administration rather than to attempt a coalition with the Lib Dems that neither his own side nor Mr Clegg&#8217;s could easily stomach. Parliament resumes on May 18th, and May 25th, when the new government will outline its priorities in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, is the unofficial deadline for this arrangement to come together. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A minority government could survive for a while. The Democratic Unionists are likely to vote with the Tories, though not without demanding goodies for Northern Ireland in return. Moreover, many of the Tories&#8217; policy plans either may not require primary legislation (such as efficiency savings in government) or would win Lib Dem backing anyway (such as their schools reform package). And rebellions from Mr Cameron&#8217;s own MPs will be few and far between in his early months in office, as many of the things he will be doing (such as cutting public spending) will meet with their approval. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hung parliaments do not tend to last long, however; the previous one, in 1974, survived for just a few months. This time too another general election soon, to produce a government with a majority of its own, is a real possibility. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What, then, of electoral reform? If that second election transpires, it looks increasingly likely to be held under the same first-past-the-post voting system that Westminster has always known. Certainly, the Lib Dems are in a weak position to demand a more proportional electoral model from Mr Cameron after this result. An election that seemed to promise nothing less than the remaking of British politics may end up being much less transformational than that. For all the talk of this being the era of change, a new prime minister appears to be about as much change as Britons really want. Almost certainly, this election has given them that. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Going postal</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Electoral fraud is not a problem confined to distant countries</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>INNOCENT CHUKWUMA, a visiting Nigerian and unofficial election observer, gravely ticks off his worries about the British electoral system: postal and proxy ballots are insecure, and why are voters (outside Northern Ireland) not required to show identification? &#8220;If you had this system in Nigeria, the outsiders would say the potential for abuse would be massive,&#8221; he says. He should know, having led a team of 50,000 observers who declared Nigeria&#8217;s 2007 presidential election a charade.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A fellow monitor, Lisa Hanna, a Jamaican MP who happens also to be a former Miss World, frets about Britain&#8217;s increasingly incomplete electoral register. In the 1950s the register reflected 98% of the adult population; today, it is more like 91%. Inaccurate voters&#8217; rolls are the bane of many third-world elections. &#8220;In Jamaica scrutineers come to your homes to check,&#8221; says Miss Hanna. &#8220;We don&#8217;t act on the basis of trust. Britain has quite a bit to learn.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite such worries, these and other observers organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society will probably declare Britain&#8217;s elections broadly sound. But they have troubling material to ponder. The <em>Daily Mail</em> this week claimed it had evidence of &#8220;massive postal-vote rigging&#8221; as police around the country confirmed that they were launching dozens of criminal inquiries. Particularly worrying are east London boroughs, where electoral rolls are said to have been packed with bogus voters. When a journalist from the <em>Independent</em> went to Bow to investigate, a group of Asian men allegedly beat him savagely.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For much of the past century electoral fraud in Britain has seemingly been limited to local elections, in which a few hundred fake ballots are more likely to affect results than they are in general elections. The last time a contest for a Westminster seat was declared void because of malpractice was in 1923. And even at the local level relatively few people have been found guilty of breaking electoral law. Back in 1995 there were 14 convictions for it, the most in any single year before or since.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet two trends are troubling. The first is the prevalence of Asians, especially of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin, among those convicted of electoral fraud. Stuart Wilks-Heeg of Democratic Audit, a research group, points out that British Asians make up half of all those convicted since 2000. Where fraud is most common&#8212;such as in Burnley, Oldham, Birmingham&#8212;and allegations most persistent there are also large Asian populations. He points to &#8220;biraderi&#8221;, brotherhood networks, used to rally support for particular candidates&#8212;a practice imported from Pakistan. (He also notes that convictions for electoral fraud may be undercounted because some cases are pursued under general fraud laws.)</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such networks may be especially effective at exploiting the other trend: a sharp rise in postal voting. A 2000 law, designed to boost turnout, makes it easy for voters to cast their ballots by post. The share of the electorate who do so has risen from about 2% in the late 20th century to 15% in 2005 and probably above 20% in 2010. In some constituencies it could pass 40% and in certain wards, for example in Oldham, over half of all ballots will be postal. Some constituencies have reported a surge in demand for postal ballots recently.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most serious allegations of electoral fraud suggest that leaders of biraderi networks, or others, apply for postal ballots for non-existent or ineligible voters and then establish &#8220;vote farms&#8221;. Residents of one small home in Tower Hamlets, for example, where five adults were previously registered, reportedly applied for an extra seven postal votes in recent weeks. Even where voters do really exist, the suspicion is that network organisers put pressure on people to back a favoured candidate, or complete their ballot papers for them. Salma Yaqoob, a Respect candidate in Birmingham, wants postal voting on demand scrapped because &#8220;thousands&#8221; of Asian women are disenfranchised by male relatives who take control of their votes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Electoral Commission retorts that it has robust measures to prevent fraud, and that the recent surge in allegations is a sign that people think the police will take them seriously. In European and local elections last year 22m votes were cast and 48 complaints made, but there were no &#8220;major allegations&#8221; of fraud or contested results, the commission says. (Future polls may be safer as individuals, not merely a householder on behalf of others, will register to vote, supplying national insurance numbers to do so). As for postal ballots, rules imposed in 2006 require an applicant to provide a sample signature and his date of birth, which are checked when the ballot is received.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is hardly a cast-iron protection: anyone registering fake applicants for postal votes could easily supply fake signatures too. But evidence from by-elections since 2006 suggests that the new signature system could lead to more rejections of postal ballots: in some constituencies 8% of them were scrapped, says Mr Wilks-Heeg.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That brings its own troubles. In close races defeated candidates might now claim that unfairly rejected postal ballots cost them victory, raising the prospect of more results being disputed. No one expects bitter fights on the scale of Florida&#8217;s &#8220;hanging chads&#8221; fiasco, but wrangling&#8212;and allegations of fraud&#8212;may dent voters&#8217; trust. Mr Chukwuma concludes, quoting Lenin, that &#8220;trust is good, but control is better&#8221;. He suggests it may be time to reimpose tighter restrictions on postal voters.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN 1997 the Conservatives bequeathed to Tony Blair&#8217;s Labour government what they now call a &#8220;golden economic inheritance&#8221;. National output was bounding ahead and unemployment tumbling. The public finances were on the mend after a relapse in the recession of the early 1990s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The legacy after the 2010 election could hardly differ more. The economy is only just starting to recover from the worst recession in modern times. Unemployment is still rising. The blowout in public borrowing is far graver than in the 1990s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is a way out of the mess, but the journey will be arduous and perilous. A sustained recovery must be combined with a harsh clampdown on government spending and increased taxation. That will curb domestic demand, which will in any case be held back by high private indebtedness. The hope is that Britain can trade its way out of trouble while keeping interest rates low enough to contain the pain of servicing excessive debts. But things could easily go wrong, not least if the Greek crisis infects other parts of the euro area and Britain suffers as a consequence. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A recovery has begun but it is nothing to write home about. After a year and a half of contraction, GDP grew by 0.4% in last three months of 2009. National output carried on rising in the first quarter of 2010 but by only 0.2%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in late April (see chart). That still leaves it 5.6% below its peak in early 2008. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This cheerless picture could brighten as more information becomes available (the first estimate draws on about 40% of the data that eventually go into calculating GDP). After all, the ONS first worked out that national output had grown by 0.1%, not 0.4%, in late 2009. But the statisticians deny that such revisions tend to be upward (at least since the mid-1990s), and there were solid reasons for growth to be dismal in early 2010. The main rate of VAT, a consumption tax, went up from the level to which it was dropped to fight recession. Factories and shops were hit by unusually cold weather at the start of the year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More timely business surveys suggest that the recovery will pick up. An index of manufacturing conditions based on the views of purchasing managers rose in April to its highest since 1994, reported Markit, an economic-research firm, on May 4th. That chimes with an industrial-trends survey published in late April by the CBI, a business lobby, which recorded a sharp rise in business optimism.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet forecasts for growth this year remain low. The economy will expand by just 1.3% in 2010, according to the average of independent forecasts made in the first half of April and compiled by the Treasury. Much of that feeble growth will come from a turnaround in the inventory cycle as companies stop de-stocking at the scary rate that exacerbated the recession in 2009. Consumer spending will no more than sidle ahead, and fixed investment will continue to decline. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such a meagre growth rate will not suffice to stop further job losses. Unemployment has reached 2.5m, or 8% of the workforce, its highest since 1996. It is likely to carry on rising, even if it falls short of the 3m that looked likely in early 2009 when output was plummeting. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The pallid recovery should strengthen next year as exporters, spurred by a weak pound, hit their stride. The value of sterling against a trade-weighted basket of currencies is now around 25% lower than in mid-2007, before the financial crisis began. That is a bigger depreciation than the one that occurred after the pound was kicked out of the European exchange-rate mechanism in September 1992 and fell by 18%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The response of export volumes has been disappointing until now. Rather than trying to increase market share by lowering their foreign-currency prices, exporters have rebuilt their profit margins. But much the same occurred after Black Wednesday in 1992. Just as that earlier fall in sterling eventually fed through to higher exports, so this bigger depreciation should also lead to a big boost. &#8220;It&#8217;s after that rebuilding of margins that firms start to invest in expanding their overseas market share,&#8221; says Stephen Radley, head of policy at the EEF, a manufacturing-employers group. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Cheaper sterling should also help British producers win back market share at home from imports. If net trade&#8212;exports less imports&#8212;can make a decent contribution to GDP growth in 2011, that should encourage a recovery in business investment, which slumped by almost a fifth last year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Companies are certainly in a position to invest. The non-financial corporate sector is running a big surplus (ie, it is saving more than it is investing). What is holding back firms from investing is now mainly uncertainty about demand rather than access to credit, says Mr Radley. Many big companies are in any case able to bypass banks and raise funds directly from the markets by issuing bonds or shares.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If all goes well, a sustained recovery can be driven by net trade and business investment. That will be essential because the fiscal retrenchment needed to sort out the public finances will act as a persistent drag on the economy. Public spending, which has boosted growth over the past decade, will instead be pulling it down. Meanwhile tax increases, almost certainly beyond anything indicated in the election campaign, will also curb demand. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But even this painful escape route out of the fiscal and economic mess will be beset by traps and ambushes. Much will depend upon whether the Bank of England can keep monetary policy as loose as possible, to offset the big fiscal tightening. Even if it does, the base rate will have to rise, sooner rather than later, from its current emergency low of 0.5%. That blast of reality will deliver quite a shock to Britain&#8217;s heavily indebted households.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some worry that Britain could go the way of Greece. After all, both had similar budget deficits last year&#8212;11.5% of GDP in Britain, 13.6% in Greece. But the differences are more telling. Greece&#8217;s government-debt burden of 115% of GDP at the end of 2009 was much higher than Britain&#8217;s 68%. The average maturity of the Greek debt is nearly eight years, compared with 13.5 for Britain&#8217;s at the end of last year; this means that Greece has to refinance a bigger portion of its outstanding debt each year. Most important, Greece is locked into the euro, and thus cannot regain competitiveness by allowing its own currency to depreciate, as Britain has done. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite these differences the crisis in Greece could still dent Britain&#8217;s recovery. Although Greece makes up only about 2.5% of euro-area GDP, its woes are proving contagious. To the extent that this weakens European growth, Britain will suffer since the euro area is its biggest trading partner, buying nearly half of British exports. No economy is an island and one as open as Britain&#8217;s will be diminished by the bell tolling in Europe.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Cold feet</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A regulator holds up the Pru&#8217;s giant Asian merger</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE bankers were in the building at Laurence Pountney Hill on May 4th, poised to price a $21 billion (\xA314 billion) rights issue. Printing presses were ready to spew out the 1,000-page prospectus. Then came the bombshell: the man from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was not happy with the man from the Pru.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>With that, a $35.5 billion deal to transform Prudential PLC, Britain&#8217;s best-known life insurer, into a dominant force in Asia was put on hold. Prudential wants to buy AIA, the Asian operations of American International Group (AIG), an insurance giant bailed out by the American government in 2008. AIA is in ten large Asian countries and the biggest life insurer in two of them; Prudential dominates in four. Together AIA and the Pru would become the leading life insurer in seven Asian countries, and the biggest foreign provider in China and India. Apart from the rights issue, Prudential is planning to raise another $10 billion in bonds, and to place $5.5 billion of its own shares with AIG.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deal was delayed, it seems, because the FSA got cold feet. It would remain the Prudential&#8217;s lead regulator, under international rules now in the works, even though at least 60% of the insurer&#8217;s new business income would be in Asia. With blood from the global financial crisis still flowing, it makes sense that the main regulator of a far-flung conglomerate, by most measures too big to fail, would want to be sure that capital is available in London in case of need. This last-minute hitch rather thwarted the earlier regulatory due diligence carried out on behalf of Prudential by lawyers Slaughter &amp; May.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Capital rules for insurers are in a state of flux. A new European Union (EU) directive known as Solvency II, which will have global ramifications, is being thrashed through various EU bodies and is about 95% complete. But studies on its likely impact are still being done. A big concern about the Prudential deal, under Solvency II, is whether the British holding company would have ready access to capital held outside the EU. The new Prudential plans to list its shares in Hong Kong and Singapore as well as in London and New York.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The FSA&#8217;s objections may require the Pru to find yet more capital. This week&#8217;s thwarted attempt was already the biggest British rights issue ever, apart from those involving government money. And critics of the acquisition, including some of the Pru&#8217;s big shareholders, think the firm is overpaying. AIG was preparing to float AIA for up to $25 billion when Prudential stepped in with an offer $10 billion higher.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tidjane Thiam, Prudential&#8217;s current chief executive, and Mark Tucker, his predecessor, have pushed resolutely towards Asian expansion. The potential for growth in Asia, compared with prospects in more mature markets in Europe and America, is mouth-watering on paper: life insurance premiums gathered in India and China account for only 4% and 2.2% of GDP respectively; in Britain it is 10.6%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet there are those who worry, following reports that the Pru is ready to sell its British business to chase its Asian dream, that this 162-year-old insurance company is burning boats it should hang on to. On the numbers alone it may seem compelling to go flat-out for growth. But shareholders in financial institutions have seen rather too much of that strategy lately to be entirely comfortable with it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a report published on April 30th, the OECD, a rich-country club, analyses the impact of the financial crisis on insurance. It warns supervisors to take more account of macroprudential spillover as many insurers react similarly to economic events. It may be that some such consideration prompted the FSA to slam on the brakes. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Out with the old and the not-so-old</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Westminster has lost some of its biggest beasts</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AFTER the sleaze of the previous parliament, few lament the departure of an unusually large cohort of MPs before polling day. A record 151 of 646 legislators chose to quit, a bigger batch than even in 1945, when years of war and coalition government led to 128 MPs standing down. Some went because they had been exposed for refurbishing their homes on expenses. Some elected to jump before the &#8220;golden parachute&#8221;&#8212;cash to help them in &#8220;adjusting to non-parliamentary life&#8221;&#8212;was removed. Others simply decided it was time to go.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> One clear-out is of ministers who served under Margaret Thatcher. The biggest man to vanish is Michael Howard, a serial cabinet member who made his name under her successor as home secretary. In that post he took seriously&#8212;some would say too seriously&#8212;the job of fighting crime, restricting the right of those charged with criminal offences to remain silent and increasing prison sentences. Later leader of the opposition, Mr Howard presided over the Conservative Party&#8217;s third consecutive defeat. He had, said his junior minister at the Home Office, &#8220;something of the night about him&#8221;. It was a tag he never quite shook off. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That junior minister is also away home. Ann Widdecombe achieved no position in government higher than that of prisons minister. In that role, however, she gained notoriety for supporting a policy of shackling prisoners in hospitals, even those giving birth. A committed Christian, she is no fan of the social revolution. Her solidly right-wing views, unflinchingly expressed, gained her a certain following, but she was unsuccessful in her attempt to be elected Speaker of the Commons in 2009. The <em>Telegraph </em>described her record on parliamentary expenses as saintly. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Half of those stepping down came to power with Tony Blair in 1997; there seems to be unusual attrition among his higher-flying acolytes from the reforming wing of the Labour Party. Patricia Hewitt, a former health secretary who oversaw the ban on smoking in public places in England, has left along with her predecessor, John Reid, who did his best to thwart such a ban. A strong supporter, in cabinet and on the backbenches, of involving private firms in the provision of public services, Alan Milburn has stepped down too. Another to trundle off into the sunset is Stephen Byers, an ex-transport secretary who recently described himself as a &#8220;cab for hire&#8221; to an undercover journalist who pretended to be looking for a lobbyist. Two younger Labour politicians who might have aspired to higher office have also hung up their jerseys. Ruth Kelly, made education secretary at the tender age of 36, has left Parliament at 41. And James Purnell, tipped as a future Labour leader when he was work and pensions secretary under Gordon Brown, has quit aged 40.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other leavers, too, were defining in their various ways. The Rev Ian Paisley, founder of the Democratic Unionists, for more than half a century obstructed efforts to reconcile Northern Ireland&#8217;s warring communities before becoming first minister in a power-sharing deal. Alex Salmond, first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, plans to confine his efforts to the country he hopes to make independent. Parliamentary sketch-writers will most rue the departure of John Prescott, deputy prime minister to Mr Blair and famed mangler of the English language (eg, green belts are a &#8220;Labour achievement, and we intend to build on it&#8221;). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dissolving parliament in 1653, Oliver Cromwell thundered, &#8220;You have sat too long for any good you have been doing lately&#8230;Depart, I say; and let us have done with you.&#8221; It is hard to improve on that sentiment today, though some who have made their mark will be missed.</p>\r\n\

    <h1>Night-time at the museum</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Opening galleries out of hours aims to entice a mostly youthful crowd</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS DARKNESS falls on May 14th, Britain&#8217;s museums will fling open their doors. The cavernous turbine hall of the Tate Modern, which is simultaneously celebrating its tenth birthday, will be filled with music, art and film shows. Indian culture and music will flood the National Portrait Gallery. The curtains will be drawn at Apsley House and chandeliers will twinkle. Curators at the Grant Museum of Zoology at University College London will lead torch-lit tours of its exhibits: skeletons, mounted animals and specimens preserved in fluid will cast flickering shadows on the walls. Beyond the capital, York Minster will admit night-time callers and visitors to Bristol&#8217;s suspension bridge will be given a tour of its illuminations.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;Museums at night&#8221; will run for three evenings. The aim is to attract a new crowd to stately homes, cathedrals, art galleries and collections, as well as to present their contents in a new light to those already familiar with them. It forms part of an initiative started in France in 2005: many other European countries will open their museums on the night of May 15th. Its debut in Britain last year attracted some 34,000 people to more than 150 events across the country.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over the past few years, museums have been devising ever more eye-catching ways to entice visitors through their doors. Audio guides are now ubiquitous, and plush shops selling fancy gifts abut smart caf\xE9s and restaurants. Many museums have extended opening hours towards the end of the week, giving workers nailed by day to their desks or shopfloors access on Thursday evenings, for example. Others dress up their guides in period costumes to tell the story of their prized displays. And public interest is easily aroused. When the government decided in 2001 to make entry to state-owned museums free, visits soared and have since climbed further, reaching 40m in the most recent financial year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One of the most ambitious attempts to attract new visitors was concocted by Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum. &#8220;A History of the World in 100 Objects&#8221;, a BBC radio series written and presented by him, examines the development of mankind by looking at objects in the museum&#8217;s collection. It is bringing in the crowds, the museum says. Fans in Britain and abroad will be glad to know that, after a painfully long pause, the next lot of episodes is ready to start rolling again on May 17th. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Sweet to tweet</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Twitter makes politicians seem more accessible. To matter, it needs to change their behaviour</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SINCE feudal days, subjects have hoped that petitioning the sovereign can have great effects. E-mail made writing to politicians easy. Now a new technology is making those missives public. Twitter messages (&#8220;tweets&#8221; in the jargon) are like public telegrams. No more than 140 characters in length, they can be sent from any computer or mobile phone. Anyone with an account (there are 100m and rising) can send a public message to anyone else by placing the @ sign before a username or a # sign before a topic.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That makes it much easier for voters to reach politicians and for politicians to react to them (or at least to pretend to). It helps election organisers too. At its height Barack Obama&#8217;s campaign (@barackobama) employed 100 staff working on social media such as Twitter. But now it is catching on elsewhere. In July just four of the world&#8217;s top 20 cities for Twitter use were outside America, according to HubSpot, a marketing firm. By January it had grown to eight.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Sebasti\xE1n Pi\xF1era, the newly elected president of Chile, has asked all cabinet members to start tweeting. His own account is now the most-followed in the country. Venezuala&#8217;s Hugo Ch\xE1vez tweets too (@chavezcandanga). In June only three Japanese politicians had accounts; now Politter, a site dedicated to Twitter and Japanese politics, lists 485. An analysis of last year&#8217;s German elections by the University of St Gallen discovered that 577 politicians had opened Twitter accounts, three-quarters of them in 2009. Greece&#8217;s prime minister George Papandreou uses Twitter. But @primeministergr is the office, not the man. His staff tweet for him, sometimes using a code to signal who wrote what. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Twitter, says Mr Pi\xF1era&#8217;s spokeswoman, Ena von Baer, means assessing reactions to announcements before presenting them in a press conference. But the scale of response makes it hard for office-holders to tweet themselves. Mr Obama reads just a select ten of the messages (20,000 of all kinds) he receives daily. During the presidential election campaign, Ms von Baer answered every message to @enavonbaer herself, but now her staff respond, or pass questions on to other ministries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Twitter works well for extrovert and conscientious individual politicians. Denis Coderre (@deniscoderre) started using it for relief and rescue messages after the Haitian earthquake in January (his electoral district in Montreal has a big Haitian population). He writes social messages, such as commentaries on ice-hockey matches (he was a sportscaster before he became a politician). A second category is service messages for his constituents. A third is purely political. To benefit, a politician must do all of them himself, he says. But few match his talent or output. Twitter may feel personal but it is all too public. The risk is asymmetric. An ill-judged tweet can do severe, instant damage. Kerry McCarthy, a Labour candidate in Britain&#8217;s election, revealed early postal-vote counts in a tweet that ended &#8220;#gameON!&#8221;. That may have seriously breached electoral law.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As well as boosting the profile of individual politicians, Twitter may be better designed for campaigning and opposition than for governing. &#8220;We&#8217;ll change Washington&#8221; is easy to fit into 140 characters. Explaining the messy and inevitable compromises of power is a lot harder. In January of this year a study by Fleishman Hillard, a Washington PR firm, discovered that Republicans in the House twittered more than five times as often as Democrats. Ms von Baer says that the Chilean opposition uses Twitter to make up for its poor coverage in the mainstream media.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Not really real life</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The days when tweets involved a sweaty-thumbed real-life politician giving candid thoughts on the day&#8217;s events may be passing. Risk-averse politicians are likely to make their tweets bland, and bland tweeters may be less likely to be followed. Once politicians understand that everything is public, they are much less likely to offer the unadorned truth, at least to ordinary voters. William Hague, a top Tory politician, amused his followers by responding to a tweeted inquiry about the menu at a recent fast-food supper (Chicken Royale and a Fanta)&#8212;but his interrogator was not just anyone, but Bryony Gordon, a hotshot columnist for a national daily. Few subjects will ever come truly close to their sovereigns. But the impression of doing so remains tantalising.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Ancient Athens online</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Democracy is about discussion, not just voting</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>REFLECTION and representation are not an easy fit. For an individual voter, being well-informed about every twist of public policy is an irrational use of time. But leaving a self-selecting elite of wonks and careerists in charge of policy-making is unappealing. In ancient Athens, which invented both democracy and the dilemma, a machine called a kleroterion picked a random 500 people to make policy from the 50,000-odd polity. The jury excluded women and slaves and the decisions it reached were sometimes dodgy (condemning Socrates was probably a mistake). But the approach is returning in a modern guise, under the label of &#8220;deliberative democracy&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A leading practitioner is James Fishkin of Stanford University. He starts by canvassing views from a large sample of people. Then a smaller subset (normally around 300-strong) receives briefing materials from the opposing advocacy groups. Moderators lead small group discussions which then draw up questions for experts and policymakers. If the samples are statistically representative, that should, so goes the theory, give a credible picture of what the entire population would think, were it as well-informed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such polls have covered aboriginal rights in Australia and traffic jams in La Plata. A Chinese jury is looking at land rights. In Fujisawa in Japan a poll on local-government planning will start in August.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Discussions and briefing often lead to a shift away from populist viewpoints. In a recent poll in Britain support for making party manifesto promises legally binding plunged from 41% to 18%. In recession-hit Michigan a discussion raised support for bigger taxes (from 27% to 45% for income tax, for example). By contrast, support for cuts in corporate taxes rocketed 27 points to 67%: the more people thought about the issue, the more they wanted a better business environment and a lower deficit. But some results are discomfiting (at least for those with this newspaper&#8217;s views). A pan-European poll in October 2007 found that support for European Union membership for Turkey and Ukraine fell by a fifth as the discussion progressed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Deliberation counts for something, with a statistically significant shift in opinion on three out of four questions, and the biggest changes coming from those whose gains in knowledge are the greatest. The internet means that the discussion no longer needs to be face-to-face, though it involves fixes to ensure a statistically fair proportion of the unwebbed population is included. But being online can cut costs by as much as 90%. Mr Fishkin recalls that the first America-wide deliberative poll, in 1996, required airline sponsorship to fly participants to the venue in Austin, Texas. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Trademarking the methodology of a deliberative poll (as Mr Fishkin has done) may be a form of quality control. Even so the polls risk remaining an interesting gimmick, rather than a substitute for the messy business of elections, referendums and media campaigns: unless, that is, their conclusions have real bite.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But some signs suggest this is happening. In 2007 the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), then in opposition, used deliberative polling to select its mayoral candidate for the Athenian district of Marousi (in the real election, he lost). Traditionalists looked in vain for the kleroterion, however: a personal computer drew the sample instead. In 2005 the local authorities in Zeguo, China, used the technique to apportion a 40m yuan ($5.9m) infrastructure budget. In 2008 the approach was extended to the township&#8217;s entire kitty. On May 10th the Central Party School, a hatchery for Beijing&#8217;s top cadres, will start a pow-wow on the theory and practice of deliberative democracy. In a country where rulers are edgy about the masses getting too much power, the carefully channelled discussions of a deliberative poll could prove a useful safety valve.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Pot (kettle) black</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A scandal in snooker points to wider worries about match-fixing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WISE punters bet on simple outcomes of big matches. That is the lesson of the latest corruption scandal to hit international sport. On May 2nd the <em>News of the World</em>, a British Sunday tabloid, published an account of a sting operation in which John Higgins, the world&#8217;s top-ranked snooker player, and his agent Patrick Mooney, appeared to agree to accept bribes in return for losing specific frames in future contests. Mr Mooney has resigned from snooker&#8217;s governing body. It has suspended Mr Higgins, who denies wrongdoing and has vowed to clear his name.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Corruption in sport, like betting on it, dates back to ancient Greece. But technology and globalisation make it easier for the two to combine. Wealthy punters can place big bets on events involving ill-paid sportsmen in faraway places. Gangsters then find rich pickings in nobbling the participants. In November the European football authority, UEFA, launched a big inquiry involving 200 matches and teams from 11 countries. In February it banned a Bosnian referee for life and suspended two other officials. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many blame the betting industry, which offers wagers on not just the outcomes of contests, but also on virtually random events within them, such as the number of yellow cards issued in a football match, or the number of no-balls bowled during an innings in cricket. Such side-bets can allow a crooked player or referee to cash in by pleasing a match-rigger in a way that is all but invisible even to a suspicious outsider. Equally vulnerable are games with no wider significance, such as those played by likely losers in qualifying rounds, or end-of-season league matches.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Reputable bookmakers in places such as Europe insist that they are the victims of such abuse, not its abetters. Their profits depend on fair play, they point out: dirty work means more profit for the match-riggers and less for them. They blame complacency among the sports authorities for the problem. Investigating corruption properly and publicly implies that it exists, which disillusions fans and deters sponsors. Too often sports administrators prefer to see, hear and think no evil.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What works best is a combination of tough disciplinary codes and easy ways for sportsmen to notify the authorities if they are approached by match-fixers. That would make cheating a riskier bet.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The box office strikes back</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Once incidental to Hollywood&#8217;s fortunes, cinema is now the fastest-growing and most innovative part of the film business</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SUMMER begins on May 7th, at least according to Hollywood&#8217;s calendar. On that day &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; is due to be released in American and Asian cinemas (it appeared a week earlier in Europe, to take advantage of the May Day holiday). Like many modern blockbusters, the film trades on nostalgia. It is based on a comic-book series that began in the 1960s and even features a Russian baddie. This is appropriate, given the state of the film business. Technological progress and changes in tastes mean that Hollywood depends more and more on the old-fashioned practice of showing films in cinemas.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Film exhibition was until recently a humdrum business. The formula for success was simple: sell lots of tickets at the same price, then funnel punters past salty popcorn and fizzy drinks. Cinemas keep about half the price of a ticket and up to 90% of the money spent at concession stands. For film-makers, showing movies in cinemas was important not so much in its own right but as a means of drawing attention to a product, the most profitable incarnations of which would appear later. The real money was in home entertainment, especially sales of DVDs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But now the pendulum is swinging back towards the box office. In 2009 global box-office revenues increased by 7.6%, but total revenue for the biggest Hollywood studios fell by 4.3%, &#8220;due to the collapse of consumer spending on DVDs&#8221;, according to Bernstein, a research firm.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Since 2005 North American box-office receipts have risen by 20% (see chart). Ticket sales grew strongly during the recession, as people sought a cheapish night out, and have not slowed. Box Office Mojo, which tracks films, estimates that box-office receipts this year are running at 6% above last year&#8217;s level. Elsewhere cinema is healthier still. Ticket sales outside America and Canada have risen by 35% since 2005 and are now worth about two-thirds of the global total. A boom in multiplexes&#8212;that is, cinemas with at least eight screens&#8212;is unlocking latent demand. In 2006 Russians made a total of 89.5m visits to the cinema. Last year they made 132.3m. This is especially surprising in a country where the number of young people is falling.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile revenues from DVDs, Blu-ray discs and digital copies of films together have fallen by 8% in America since 2005, according to the Digital Entertainment Group. That figure, which includes rentals and sales of such things as exercise videos, flatters Hollywood. Stephen Prough of Salem Partners, an investment bank, says DVD sales of new films fell by 17% between 2008 and 2009 alone. The main culprit, he says, is the emergence of cheap, convenient rental services such as Netflix and Redbox. Although the drop has been less steep elsewhere, people in other countries never bought many DVDs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What is driving the cinema boom? The most obvious answer, for consumers, is the rise of three-dimensional films. Audiences have flocked to films like &#8220;Avatar&#8221;, a vaguely ecological fantasy, and &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221;. In North America 3-D films drove almost all the growth in box-office receipts last year. Although the premium that cinemas charge for 3-D films has risen steeply from as little as $1 per ticket to $3 or more, consumers have not balked. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know how much they are willing to pay,&#8221; says David Passman, chief executive of Carmike, a cinema chain. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More important, though less visible, is the digitisation of cinema. The number of screens served by digital projectors worldwide rose from about 3,000 to 16,400 between 2006 and 2009, according to Screen Digest, a research firm. That primed the explosion in 3-D films: it is hard, though not impossible, to project a 3-D image using old-fashioned film. Digitisation has made it easier for multiplex owners to shuffle films around screens to cope with surges in demand. And satellite distribution is making it easier and cheaper for films to open simultaneously around the world.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Digitisation is a particular boon to IMAX, a Canadian firm that makes bigger, taller screens. Once associated with films of fish in natural-history museums, IMAX now offers its products to multiplexes (the first few rows of seats are sometimes removed to accommodate the bigger screens). For the past 18 months it has been converting two to three screens a week. This would have been almost impossible without digitisation. Its larger film size means it costs about $25,000 to make a single print of an IMAX film. The need to recoup such costs necessitated long film runs. Now that IMAX films can be delivered digitally for a few hundred dollars, they can be programmed more like ordinary films. Cinemas tend to charge 30-40% above the ordinary ticket price. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Name your price</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Cinema-owners have long suspected that, by charging the same amount to see a $2m independent film and a $200m blockbuster, they were leaving money on the table. The response to 3-D films and IMAX proves that they were. Cinema is evolving from a commodity into a business that sells differentiated products at varied prices. The example of India suggests that there is room for further differentiation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Multiplexes are rising in many Indian cities: Mumbai alone has added more than 75 screens in the past five years, says Anil Arjun, chief executive of Reliance MediaWorks. They appeal to, and are priced for, India&#8217;s aspirant middle class. Fame, a cinema chain, charges an average of 141 rupees ($3.15) per ticket, in a country where daily income per person is just 120 rupees. Some cinemas have replaced rows of seats with widely spaced reclining chairs, with tray tables and waiter service. This model appears to be spreading to the West. Carmike has opened a cinema in Tennessee that serves alcohol and food, to great success. The draw seems to be not just comfortable seats, but the absence of teenagers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Film-makers are adapting to these changes. India&#8217;s new cinemas have given rise to &#8220;multiplex films&#8221;, focused on the concerns of affluent youngsters and with somewhat less singing and dancing than in standard Bollywood fare. Elsewhere the rise of 3-D and the super-sizing of screens are leading studios to focus on visual spectaculars. &#8220;French table dramas do not look much better on IMAX,&#8221; notes Julian Stanford, who manages that company&#8217;s business in Europe and Africa. The growth of screens outside America also favours big action films: an explosion is an explosion, regardless of language.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The loser, as so often, is grown-up drama. In the past two years the big studios have shut or run down &#8220;specialty&#8221; divisions like Focus Features and Miramax (the latter may yet return, in a much depleted state, to Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who founded it). Fans of such films are out of luck. They should certainly steer clear of cinemas this summer. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Love is in the air</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The creation of the biggest airline in the world is less exciting than it sounds</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE announcement of a merger to form the world&#8217;s largest airline, with the capacity to carry nearly 150m passengers a year, might once have caused a flurry of excitement. But the $3 billion all-share deal to bring together United Airlines (UAL) and Continental Airlines was greeted on May 3rd with a politely stifled yawn. Industry rivals, employees of the two carriers and even consumer advocates&#8212;all potential losers from the combination&#8212;expressed mild misgivings but concluded that such consolidations were a sign of the times. Wall Street granted lukewarm approval, marking shares in both firms down a little.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Reaction was muted partly because there was nothing surprising about the deal. A couple of years ago, immediately after the merger of two other big American airlines, Delta and Northwest, UAL and Continental tried to follow suit. But record oil prices and the onrushing recession persuaded Continental that it was not the time to take on new risks (not least UAL&#8217;s rickety finances). Although both airlines made hefty losses last year, the improving economy, recovering business traffic and cheaper fuel created the conditions for a second attempt. However, the trigger for new talks was an impending tie-up between UAL and another carrier, US Airways. Continental&#8217;s boss, Jeff Smisek rang his opposite number at UAL, Glenn Tilton, on April 9th to tell him that there was a better option. Mr Smisek said this week: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to him marry the ugly girl. I wanted him to marry the pretty one, and I&#8217;m much prettier.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Tilton insists that it had never been his intention to use jilted US Airways as bait to snare Continental, but there is no doubt that the deal he now has makes a lot of sense. The two chief executives claim that the combined carrier should benefit from savings of at least $1 billion a year and from substantial extra revenues once operational integration is complete by 2013. The airlines&#8217; networks at home and abroad are highly complementary, except in their hub cities, which will allow them to reduce capacity without conceding market share to competitors. Continental&#8217;s recent decision to join UAL in the Star Alliance should also help. And they now have the example of Delta and Northwest to follow: their merger seems to have gone more smoothly than some others in the past, and is already yielding big savings. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, there are still a number of hurdles to be overcome. Although the airline unions appear resigned to job losses among the 88,000 employees of both companies, vexed issues such as the seniority of pilots will need deft handling. UAL and Continental, unlike Delta and Northwest, use different booking systems, which will make bringing together back-office functions more fraught. Regulatory approval could also prove trickier than for Delta and Northwest, whose deal was approved by George Bush&#8217;s relatively laissez-faire Department of Justice. Although the merger is highly unlikely to be blocked, Barack Obama&#8217;s administration, with its close ties to trade unions, could delay approval or attach unwelcome conditions to a deal the parties are anxious to seal before the end of the year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bringing United and Continental together should create a stronger, more financially stable airline, at least in the short to medium term. But it is not a transformative deal. American network carriers will still suffer from familiar ills: over-regulation, high overheads, inflexible unions, elderly fleets and constant attrition from low-cost point-to-point operators. Consolidation can provide some breathing space, but it does not fundamentally alter the dynamics of an industry still riddled with structural inefficiencies. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Vale of the trolls</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A deal with Norway marks a change of course for a Brazilian mining giant</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NOTEWORTHY encounters between Brazil and Norway are rare. Norwegians could point to their country&#8217;s unexpected 2-1 victory over Brazil&#8217;s footballing princes at the 1998 World Cup. Brazilians may prefer to focus on a recent business deal. On May 2nd Norsk Hydro announced that it was acquiring the aluminium assets of Vale, the world&#8217;s second-largest mining company. In a deal valued at $4.9 billion, Norsk will add a mammoth bauxite mine, the world&#8217;s biggest alumina refinery and a large smelter to its own substantial aluminium business. In return the Brazilian mining giant will take a 22% stake in Norsk and pocket $1.1 billion in cash.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Producing aluminium competitively requires cheap energy and cheap alumina, the stuff&#8212;made from bauxite&#8212;that is smelted into the metal. Most aluminium firms with the lowest costs have both. Norsk hopes to join them. It already generates bags of hydro-electric power but has relied on pricey long-term contracts with miners, or the volatile spot market, for raw materials. The availability of huge quantities of bauxite at competitive prices also offers Norsk the opportunity to expand a recently opened smelter in Qatar.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For Vale, ridding itself of its aluminium business, its third-biggest source of revenue after iron ore and coal, marks a significant change of course. Its purchase of Inco, a Canadian nickel miner, in 2006 and its failed attempts in 2008 to take over Xstrata, another big competitor, indicated that Vale&#8217;s strategy was to become a diversified global mining giant like Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. But now, as Jordi Dominguez, an analyst at HSBC, puts it, the Brazilian company is &#8220;de-diversifying&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Having shovels in many different dirt-piles is meant to provide mining giants with insurance in a cyclical industry: not all commodities will plummet and peak at the same time, according to the theory. And of course Vale&#8217;s big shareholding in Norsk will give it continuing exposure to aluminium for the time being. But Vale clearly reckons that its best bet is to concentrate on supplying the world&#8217;s steelmakers. (Even Inco&#8217;s nickel is a vital ingredient of stainless steel.) Selling its underperforming aluminium business just days after it revealed a $2.5 billion investment to develop blocks of Simandou, a vast iron-ore deposit in Guinea, reinforces the notion that Vale wants to stay big and global but become less diversified.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Iron ore has always been the most important part of Vale&#8217;s business, sucking up half of its capital spending. This year it is set to dig up over 300m tonnes, nearly 30% of global supplies. And iron ore is selling on the spot market at close to record prices. China&#8217;s huge appetite for steel for vast infrastructure projects suggests that the price will stay high for some time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Moreover, Vale&#8217;s attempts at diversification have not always gone smoothly. Inco, which made pots of cash in its first years under Brazilian ownership, is paralysed by a strike, now in its tenth month, that shows no sign of ending. And Brazil&#8217;s government holds a golden share in Vale that lets it block big deals. It takes a keen interest in Vale&#8217;s activities and has never been keen on global diversification, preferring that the company build its business at home. So even if Vale had found a target for a huge, transforming deal, Brazil&#8217;s government, like Norway&#8217;s footballers in 1998, would have proved difficult to beat.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Join the party!</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Unions&#8212;and the state&#8212;knock on the doors of multinationals in Beijing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | HONG KONG | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN LATE April the human-resources departments of many multinational companies with offices in the district of Chaoyang, global firms&#8217; favourite part of Beijing, began receiving text messages. These messages emanated from the local district offices of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the country&#8217;s monopoly union organisation, which is closely aligned with the Communist Party. They were brief: an investigation would be carried out into the companies&#8217; operations, and a limited amount of information was requested. A close reading, however, revealed several oddities.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The union federation sought information about salaries&#8212;not the total or average, as is common&#8212;but by various managerial categories. The information was to be supplied as part of an &#8220;investigation&#8221;, a rarer and more serious affair than a mere &#8220;inquiry&#8221;. And the requests contained oblique references to a mysterious form from which the questions were drawn. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Companies on the receiving end made reciprocal inquiries, which led to a bit more clarity. Some are drawing their own conclusions. &#8220;It is a preliminary step in a drive to unionise the employees of multinationals,&#8221; says Lesli Ligorner, a lawyer in China with Paul Hastings, an international law firm. That would be consistent with China&#8217;s current policies: Hu Jintao, the country&#8217;s president, has often said it is necessary to bring multinationals&#8217; Chinese operations within the union fold to promote his vision of an harmonious society. Even so, it marks a shift: big companies have hitherto been welcomed for providing foreign capital and expertise, and spared intervention of this sort. Unionisation drives have largely been confined to industrial hubs which have a history of activism, such as Guangdong on the southern coast and Tianjin, east of Beijing.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> For the companies notified, the investigation presents a quandary. The labour law is not entirely clear about what they must do: is it their responsibility to create a union, or their employees&#8217;? Nor is it clear whether they can feasibly avoid unionisation. Wal-Mart tried, briefly, and folded. Microsoft is said to be resisting a unionisation drive and, coincidentally or not, has begun to receive critical coverage in the press about its treatment of workers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One answer is to accept the inevitable. The union federation is not known for militancy or obstructionism. Unionisation, however, does bring costs. Among the explicit ones is a payroll levy of 2%. Companies that co-operate may be allowed to exclude the salaries of expatriates, who are few but well-paid. They may also get back as much as 60% of what they hand over for spending on workers. It can be used for anything from health care to parties.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another tactic is delay. Companies have tried claiming that important executives are abroad and cannot be contacted, that the decision-making process has been upended by personnel changes or that certain papers are confidential and&#8212;alas&#8212;cannot be released, and so on. Such pleas are not implausible, and because bureaucratic snags are common in China, they may be heard sympathetically. But companies may have to pay the 2% levy, which is collected by tax authorities and then (after deducting a non-reimbursable administration fee) held in escrow, even so.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many companies are delaying anyway, hoping to avoid a greater inconvenience than the payroll charge. Another consequence of unionisation is that representatives of the workers must be included among the senior executives determining corporate strategy and the terms and conditions of employment. These are defined so broadly that they even encompass the relocation of a company&#8217;s headquarters.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Because the representatives must be approved by the union federation, they are likely to be tied, directly or indirectly, to the Chinese government. So unionisation brings the state into management. What this sort of collaboration will mean for the running of the company and the protection of trade secrets is an open question. Many foreign companies are unwilling to accept it. But if they want to operate in China, they may have no choice.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Message of hope</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Card companies believe technology will bring a smile to special occasions</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>MOTHER&#8217;S DAY, which this year falls on May 9th in many countries, is a time to give thanks and count blessings&#8212;not least for greeting-card companies. Americans alone will spend $671m on cards for this Sunday, according to the National Retail Federation. John Beeder of American Greetings, a card company, claims that his industry is &#8220;somewhat recession-proof&#8221;. The thinking is that people spend more on cards when they don&#8217;t have much cash to splash on gifts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Maybe. Card companies have fared better than some other makers of consumer products in the downturn, but they have not been unscathed. American Greetings&#8217; revenue fell by 3% in the year to February, to $1.6 billion. Hallmark, America&#8217;s largest greeting-card company, saw sales tumble by 8% last year, to $4 billion. Crane &amp; Co, a privately held firm that sells classy stationery, suffered a double-digit decline in sales in the recession. Its second-bestselling item in 2009 (after notecards) was, unusually, high-quality paper for r\xE9sum\xE9s.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The ailing economy has not been the cardmakers&#8217; only problem. People can send greetings by e-mail or via online social networks speedily without buying a stamp. If they want something fancy, they can send &#8220;e-cards&#8221;, jazzed up with animations and songs, through free websites such as 123greetings.com.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Card companies insist that e-cards do not pose a grave threat, because people use them as a supplement to physical cards or for less important dates (eg, Groundhog Day) when they would not bother putting a card in the post. Americans buy 7 billion physical cards but send only 500m e-cards a year, according to the Greeting Card Association, a trade group. Even so, Hallmark, American Greetings and others are trying to deal with the threat of e-cards by offering their own. They allow people to send free e-cards from their websites, but encourage them to buy annual subscriptions for access to the most elaborate designs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The cardmakers hope that novelty will not only keep people buying physical cards but also entice them to pay higher prices. Musical cards, which play a tune when opened, have become popular. Some cards allow the sender to record a message that is played on opening. A new Hallmark card, when held up to a web-camera, shows a 3-D cartoon character that speaks a greeting.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some ideas are intended to turn a card into a gift in itself. One card from American Greetings, on sale for around $20, has an LCD screen and can store 50 photos, which it plays as a slideshow, with music. But George van Horn of IbisWorld, a research group, warns that although such features may boost sales, they will cut into margins because they are expensive to make. He adds that rivals can copy them pretty quickly. That&#8217;s not a message any cardmaker will want to receive.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>La vie en rose</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>French companies get serious about putting women in the boardroom</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>MOST French bosses have little time for a new law, now going through parliament, which would compel listed companies to lift the proportion of women on their boards to 40% by 2016. Xavier Fontanet, chief executive of Essilor, an eyewear firm, has quoted Charles de Gaulle as saying, &#8220;One may not command without having obeyed.&#8221; His point is that few women have had the 30 years or so of experience climbing the corporate ladder that a good director requires. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nonetheless, the government is determined to make France the second country with a compulsory quota for women in the boardroom. (Norway was the first.) At the start of the year women occupied just 11% of the total of around 580 board seats at France&#8217;s biggest 40 firms. Now bosses will have to find as many as 170 new female directors in six years, according to OFG Research. &#8220;We are looking for women to fill every seat vacated by a man,&#8221; says Diane Segalen, vice-chairman of CTPartners, a headhunting firm in Paris. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In private, chief executives say they will look for female board members of a particular type: those who will look decorative and not rock the boat. One boss asked a headhunter for photographs of candidates and said he would treat looks as his first criterion, ahead of industry experience. A board member of a multinational company who opposes the 40% quota said that bosses could simply appoint their wives or&#8212;more subtly&#8212;their girlfriends. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some recent appointments have certainly raised eyebrows. In March Dassault Aviation, a manufacturer of fighter planes and corporate jets, said it would nominate Nicole Dassault, the 79-year-old wife of Serge Dassault, its controlling shareholder, to its board. Mrs Dassault has little hands-on business experience. LVMH has nominated Bernadette Chirac, the 76-year-old wife of the former French president. Mrs Chirac&#8217;s qualifications, explained the company, were that she was female and that as first lady she supported fashion and regularly attended catwalk shows. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Companies with no family controlling shareholder, to be sure, will be expected to propose more qualified candidates. But finding them is not always easy. Sanofi-Aventis, a pharmaceuticals firm, was disappointed when Catherine Br\xE9chignac, the head of the national science research agency, withdrew her candidacy. Some firms are tackling the shortage of senior women with direct experience of their industry by looking far outside. Vivendi, a telecoms and media group, for instance, found Aliza Jab\xE8s, the glamorous founder of NUXE, a beauty-products firm, having used her in an ad campaign for its corporate mobile-phone products. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far, says Pierre-Yves Gomez of EMLYON Business School, appointments such as Mrs Chirac&#8217;s confirm that the first reaction of French chief executives is to find women who will not challenge them. Because companies must find a lot of them in a short time, some women will gather many board seats. One female director, indeed, has had seven offers since January. A perverse effect of the quota, therefore, says Mr Gomez, may be to reduce rather than increase board diversity.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Case studies</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Like the companies their professors study, the world&#8217;s business schools are having to adapt to a more difficult market</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THEY are changing the guard at some of the world&#8217;s leading business schools. On May 4th Harvard Business School (HBS) announced the appointment of a new dean, Nitin Nohria, a first-class choice. The Kellogg School at Northwestern University has also recently selected a new head, and the Judge School at the University of Cambridge, the Ross School at the University of Michigan and the Booth School at the University of Chicago are all in the process of doing the same. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The newcomers will have some of the most enviable jobs in academia. The business-education market has been booming for decades: the number of MBAs awarded by American business schools swelled from 21,561 in 1969-70 to 150,211 in 2006-07. And business schools are rolling in money. HBS&#8217;s endowment is about $2.1 billion. Chicago&#8217;s business school changed its name to Booth when an alumnus handed it $300m. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet even elite schools are plagued by self-doubt. The financial crisis has dealt them a double blow. It has damaged their reputations, because so many bankers are MBAs. It has also dented their market: Wall Street laid off 240,000 people in the 18 months from the middle of 2007. But the schools&#8217; problems are deeper than this, as a new book by three of Mr Nohria&#8217;s colleagues at HBS makes clear.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The business-school boom depended largely on the idea that MBAs were entry tickets to the world&#8217;s two most lucrative professions: investment banking and consultancy. These trades not only consumed more than half the graduates of the leading schools. They also underwrote the schools&#8217; finances: students were willing to pay $100,000 in fees and living expenses (and forgo even more in income) because they were all but guaranteed jobs in these high-paying industries. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But banks and consulting firms are increasingly recruiting people without MBAs, particularly mathematicians and computer scientists. They are also getting keener on growing their own. Why lose a hard-working 25-year-old for a couple of years when you can train him internally and keep him at the coal face? Banks are increasingly dominated by traders who think MBAs are a waste of parchment. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Criticism of MBAs extends beyond consultancies and banks. People in many industries worry that business-school professors are more concerned with pure theory than with practical management (promotion is usually earned by publishing articles in academic journals rather than by teaching, advising businesses or gaining managerial experience). The professors themselves complain that their students are spending ever more time looking for jobs and ever less time studying. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These problems are already taking their toll on the two-year courses that once constituted the ideal of business education. Students are gravitating to one-year MBAs, which are offered by 70% of European business schools, and more specialised courses. Lower-ranked business schools are already finding it harder to fill their places. The elite worry that the trend will eventually catch up with them too.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet business schools have an important asset: they are remarkably flexible compared with the rest of academia. Even before the financial crisis they had begun to implement far-reaching changes. Both Stanford Business School and the Yale School of Management have changed their curricula radically in the past few years. Others will surely follow.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Business schools are wise to globalisation. INSEAD led the pack by opening a second campus in Singapore: all its students have a chance to study in Asia as well as Europe. Almost everybody has leapt on the bandwagon. The Booth School has outlets in three continents. Most schools have research centres across the world. Foreign students make up 34% of students in America&#8217;s elite schools and 85% in European schools. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Business schools have also struggled to make their courses less theoretical. Yale has replaced conventional subject-based courses (marketing and so forth) with &#8220;integrated&#8221; courses based on &#8220;constituencies&#8221; (such as investors, customers and employees). The University of Michigan&#8217;s Ross Business School gives students a chance to work with, say, hospitals in India and energy companies in Mozambique. Most schools are trying to employ more people with practical experience. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One problem is that these changes add to the already exorbitant costs of MBAs. Yale&#8217;s curriculum reform cost $2m-5m. Stanford&#8217;s entailed increasing the faculty by 10-15%. But in straitened times business schools will have to do more with less, drawing on professors from other faculties and on outside business people. In 2008-09 Harvard Medical School had a faculty of 10,884 to cope with an entering class of 165 students because it draws on such a wide range of talents. HBS looks unnecessarily exclusive by comparison.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The new generation of deans will undoubtedly preside over dramatic changes. But the changes already made have produced one huge benefit: a much more variegated environment. Business schools are offering a greater variety of courses taught in a greater variety of ways than ever before. Perhaps they are finally becoming as vibrant as the subject they study. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Tony Hayward is almost as unloved as the boss of Goldman Sachs; he is still the right man to lead BP out of the slick</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BARACK OBAMA&#8217;S administration has promised to keep its boot firmly applied to BP&#8217;s neck. Many people would be happier if the boot were a blade. Fishermen who worry that their livelihoods are in peril; shareholders who have seen the value of BP&#8217;s shares plunge; local Democratic politicians who want to make sure they cannot be blamed for reacting too slowly: the list of boot-and-blade wielders is growing longer by the day. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In practice BP&#8217;s neck means Tony Hayward&#8217;s. Just a few weeks ago Mr Hayward was one of the world&#8217;s most celebrated chief executives, responsible for delivering $5.6 billion in profits in the first quarter of this year. Now, after the collapse of a rig leased by BP in the Gulf of Mexico, costing 11 lives and threatening environmental catastrophe (see ), he is in the meat grinder of public opprobrium along with Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far he has done a creditable job of crisis-management. He has been a whirlwind of activity&#8212;moving to a Ramada Inn in Houma, Louisiana, meeting Mr Obama&#8217;s deputies and giving back-to-back interviews on American television. He has thrown the full might of his company&#8217;s resources at the problem, sending 2,500 people to help with the clean-up and chartering a sizeable armada. He has accepted &#8220;full responsibility&#8221; for the disaster&#8212;but also made it clear that the rig was being operated by a subcontractor, Transocean. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Things may yet get worse for BP. The company faces a tidal wave of litigation and an epidemic of stories about oil-drenched sea birds and devastated wetlands. The final bill for the clean-up, which is costing BP about $6m a day, could well exceed $10 billion. Mr Hayward could yet buckle under the pressure. But, if he can keep his head, he is arguably the best man to deal with an impossibly difficult situation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hayward took over BP in 2007 as the back-to-basics candidate. His predecessor, John Browne, was in many ways a remarkable chief executive, a man who sprinkled pixie dust onto the company&#8217;s black gold while also boosting its market capitalisation ninefold. But Lord Browne focused too much on the soft furnishings and too little on the foundations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He purchased rivals such as Amoco but failed to integrate them properly. He lavished more than $200m on rebranding BP as &#8220;Beyond Petroleum&#8221; but failed to reorganise the company&#8217;s sprawling bureaucracy. His final years were marred by a succession of devastating accidents&#8212;an explosion at BP&#8217;s Texas City refinery in 2005 that killed 15 workers and injured 170 others, and an oil spill a year later that dumped 4,800 barrels of oil at Prudhoe Bay, on the coast of Alaska. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hayward set out to replace flash and fluff with nuts and bolts. He promised to focus &#8220;like a laser on safe and reliable operations&#8221;. He streamlined the company&#8217;s management. He played down the Beyond Petroleum rhetoric in favour of a greater emphasis on the company&#8217;s core business. &#8220;BP makes its money by someone, somewhere, every day putting on boots, overalls, a hard hat and glasses, and going out and turning valves,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;And we&#8217;d sort of lost track of that.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To be sure, after the spill in the Gulf this back-to-basics strategy leaves him open to some sharp criticisms. Hasn&#8217;t the disaster made a mockery of his &#8220;focus like a laser&#8221; argument? And hasn&#8217;t he been at the forefront of lobbying for more deep-sea drilling? He has tried to convince the Obama administration that one of the keys to America&#8217;s energy security lies in the oil and gas in the deep waters of the Gulf. Last September he even dispatched one of his lieutenants, David Rainey, to Congress to argue that new technology had made possible the &#8220;safe and reliable production&#8221; of offshore oil. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But against all this he has a number of things on his side. One is that the disasters at Texas City and Prudhoe Bay occurred before he took over. A second is that before the current oil spill he had a solid record of improving safety and reducing injuries in the workplace. A third is that the markets have probably over-reacted to the oil spill: the fact that BP&#8217;s shares have lost $30 billion in value, three times the likely cost of the clean-up, suggests that they will start to climb back. But the fourth may count for most: that he is an oilman by conviction as well as profession.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Back from beyond</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hayward is at his most animated when reminiscing about his hands-on experience out in the field&#8212;working as a geologist on a North Sea platform (his first job with BP) or exploring for oil in Yemen or Papua New Guinea. He won widespread support in the company&#8217;s lower ranks in the wake of the Texas City disaster when he criticised BP for &#8220;a leadership style that is too directive and doesn&#8217;t listen sufficiently well&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His immediate challenge is to stanch the flow of oil. But his longer-term problem is to secure the future of deep-sea drilling. BP&#8217;s business strategy depends on its ability to keep pushing the frontiers of oil exploration: drilling the world&#8217;s deepest wells and probing the corners of the Arctic for deposits. The Gulf already accounts for 10% of the company&#8217;s worldwide oil production, a share that could be higher in the future.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hayward needs to salt his apologies for the disaster with some tough arguments about the virtues of offshore drilling. He needs to demonstrate that its risks are no greater than, say, those of long-haul shipping. (More oil is spilled from tankers than from offshore wells.) He needs to persuade a restive public that there is no magic that can provide them with risk-free energy. This will test his political skills just as much as the spill in the Gulf is testing his organisational skills. But the alternative to successful persuasion is unthinkable from Mr Hayward&#8217;s point of view: the slow destruction of BP and the betrayal of all those men who put on the protective clothes and turn the valves.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The Deepwater Horizon disaster will affect everyone from pelicans to politicians</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DRILLING for oil is a balancing act. If the pressure of the working fluids in the well, or the strength of concrete holding the piping in place, cannot balance the immense pressure of the oil down below, then things get very bad, very quickly. On April 20th, for some reason as yet unknown, the pressure in a well that had been drilled by the Deepwater Horizon, a rig that BP, one of the world&#8217;s largest oil companies, was using to explore a new field in the Gulf of Mexico, got out of balance. The well blew its top, causing an explosion and subsequent fire which claimed the lives of 11 of the rig&#8217;s crew of 126 and eventually sent the rig itself to the bottom of the ocean, a mile below the surface and some 40 miles (64km) off the Louisiana coast.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the aftermath, oil started to seep to the surface. Since then the slick has grown inexorably, despite attempts to contain and disperse it. On the distant shore they watch with concern and a certain fatalism. &#8220;This is just like waiting for a hurricane,&#8221; says LeRoy Meaux, a Louisiana welder, as he works on fixing a winch to a barge. &#8220;Been there, done that.&#8221; What no one yet knows is whether the Gulf spill will, like some hurricanes, soon fade in the memories of all but those most directly affected, or whether, like Katrina, it will cause havoc that has repercussions much farther afield. Such an outcome is certainly possible. BP has its bottom line and reputation at risk. The technology of deepwater drilling, rightly celebrated for its ingenuity, faces the prospect of more critical assessment than it has received to date. And human livelihoods and natural habitats on the coasts of four states are in jeopardy at a time when offshore drilling is playing an important role in America&#8217;s national debate about the nature and security of the country&#8217;s energy supply. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>At the end of the tether</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the sea floor beneath the Deepwater Horizon sat a device called a blowout preventer, capable of sealing off the well with a number of hydraulic systems, including one designed to slice right through the whole stack. Had it been activated beforehand it should have been able to contain the pressure in the well, saving the rig. Activated after the blowout, it would have done nothing to save the rig, but should still have been able to isolate the oil in the well from the sea above it. But neither of the two systems that should have activated the preventer after the blowout seems to have done so&#8212;or if they did, the preventer did not do its job. Oil continued to flow into the spindled and mutilated remains of the piping that had originally risen from the sea floor to the drilling platform, coming out of that wreckage at three different points and spreading over thousands of square kilometres. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The United States Coast Guard has estimated that 5,000 barrels of oil are being added to the slick every day. Ian MacDonald, a marine biologist at Florida State University who studies oil that comes out of natural seeps on the sea floor, estimates on the basis of pictures and maps from the coastguard that the rate may be as much as five times that. The largest accidental oil spill in history, which was also in the Gulf, was due to a 1979 blowout on a Mexican rig called Ixtoc-1 (see chart). Between June 1979 and March 1980 it released around 3.3m barrels. For comparison, the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> fiasco in Alaska in 1989, America&#8217;s most infamous oil spill, released just 260,000 barrels. At the coastguard rate the Deepwater Horizon leak would take years to match Ixtoc-1; at Mr MacDonald&#8217;s rate, months. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BP has developed a number of plans for stemming the flow before then. The one most assured of success requires the drilling of a new well that would intersect the existing one. Remarkably, there seems little doubt that threading such a well into the old one is possible, despite its being only seven inches across and 18,000 feet (5,500 metres) down. But more than one attempt may be needed, which is why BP has two rigs earmarked for relief wells. One has already started drilling; the other is expected to get under way shortly. Their work, though, will take months. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even if the leakage is only at the lower end of the estimates, months could add up to a great deal of oil on coastlines important for fishing, tourism and the environment. So the race is on for approaches that could work quicker. On May 5th remotely operated submersibles managed to seal off the smallest of the three leaks, which did not reduce the overall flow, but has simplified matters. BP is also building a pair of cofferdams that could sit over the leaks like inverted funnels, with piping allowing the oil up to a drilling ship at the surface. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first of these cofferdams is already built and due to be sunk by May 7th. No such system has been put together at this sort of depth before, so getting it to work is unlikely to be easy. There are, though, other options. While attempts to get the blowout preventer to shut off the flow entirely have so far failed, BP is investigating a technique called &#8220;top kill&#8221; that entails putting new pipe into the preventer through which to apply downward pressure.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many local fishing boats have signed on as vessels of opportunity to help the coastguard; the rest are tied up at their docks, as fishing in the area is no longer permitted. The seafood industry is worth $2.4 billion to the state of Louisiana when fishing, processing, selling and cooking in restaurants are all taken into account, and a fishing ban will eat into that. Tuan Nguyen, a seafood wholesaler in the small community of Venice, Louisiana, says his business was shut down for eight months after Katrina, in 2005, and his savings were obliterated: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to do, because the bills are coming in every day.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first known animal victim of the spill was a northern gannet, currently recovering. Dead jellyfish and turtles are now washing up on the beaches, and fish are suffocating. When the oil starts to wash up in quantity, the greatest environmental threat will be to the Louisiana wetlands. Oil on the fine white sand of the Mississippi, Alabama and Florida coastlines would depress tourism, but workers could scrape it up and haul it away. The muddy lattice of marshes, bayous, and barrier islands that makes up southern Louisiana is different.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The erosion of these delicate environments was a pressing issue even before the spill, made worse by the damage Katrina did to barrier islands. If the oil penetrates the wetlands it could worsen the problem further by killing the vegetation that does its best to hold the marshes together. It will also affect the wildlife therein. Mike Carloss, a biologist with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, says the brown pelicans and terns in the area are already stressed by the seasonal demands of nest building and fighting for territory, and are thus particularly vulnerable.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One of the things that the fishing boats helping the coastguard can do to help is spread dispersants. Oil is dangerous to seabirds because it dissolves the grease that insulates their feathers; they get cold and die. Dispersants cut the oil as washing-up liquid cuts the grease on dishes, allowing oil on the surface to spread down into the water. This lessens its effects on surfaces and shorelines, though it might make things worse for fish. Once dispersed the oil can then be broken down more easily by bacteria that have evolved to live off natural sources of hydrocarbons.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To avoid contaminating the sea floor, most dispersants are used only in deep water. Today&#8217;s dispersants are not as toxic as those used on the big spills of the 1970s, but they still require care, and must be kept away from some sensitive places, such as reefs and spawning grounds.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Boom and bust</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is only a short window&#8212;from a few hours to up to two days&#8212;in which dispersants are useful, says Simon Rickaby, a marine-pollution expert at Britain&#8217;s Institute of Marine Engineering Science and Technology. This is because the light fractions of an oil spill&#8212;as much as 40% of the total&#8212;will evaporate quite quickly (air-quality monitoring stations have been set up along the coast to make sure that this, in itself, does not become a health hazard). The oil left behind becomes thicker and forms a sort of mousse that is less susceptible to dispersants.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The need for early action, and the fact that the Deepwater Horizon spill is in much deeper water than most, has given rise to a new way of using dispersants. A remotely operated underwater vehicle with a &#8220;wand&#8221; rather like those used for weedkiller has been dispensing nine gallons a minute of dispersant thousands of feet below the surface, close to the leaks. The idea is to see if the slick can be broken up before it even reaches the surface.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As well as dispersants, some of the 200 or so boats and ships fighting the slick are deploying booms to prevent the oil getting into sensitive coastal locations and to corral it in places where it is concentrated enough to skim or, if the conditions are right, burn. A typical skimmer uses rotating drums or discs of plastic onto which the oil clings and is then scraped off by something like a windscreen wiper. Like dispersants, both burning and skimming need fresh oil&#8212;once things get <em>mousseux</em> there is much less that can be done. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>By May 4th, 487,000 feet of booms had been deployed, and over 650,000 feet more were available for use. Success, though, will depend on the conditions. Currents draw water under the booms, while waves splash the oil over; strong winds capsize or sink them. Although bad weather, like that of the May Day weekend, keeps boats and booms at bay, it also acts as a dispersant itself, mixing the oil into the water. Over the coming weeks and months the prevailing weather will determine whether the oil stays reasonably contained or spreads farther afield.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The various efforts to deal with the crude were, as of May 5th, costing BP about $6m a day. The costs fall to BP because, as the majority shareholder in the consortium leasing the Deepwater Horizon (the junior partners are America&#8217;s Anadarko and Japan&#8217;s Mitsui) and the project&#8217;s operator, it is liable under American law for the costs of cleaning up. BP is also, at the moment, taking most of the blame from angry Louisianans and from stockmarkets. By May 5th its capitalisation had fallen by $30 billion, or about 16%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But a number of other companies played a role. Transocean, the world&#8217;s largest offshore-drilling firm, owned and ran the Deepwater Horizon. The blowout preventer was made by Cameron International, a specialist engineer. Then there is the cementing of the wellhead, a process which is necessarily tricky. When the cement is wet, its pressure serves to balance the forces inside the well; when it is dry its strength does. But as it sets from wet to dry things can go wrong. This process, which has been implicated in a number of blowouts, was carried out by Halliburton, an engineering-services firm. How blame is eventually allocated among these companies remains to be seen.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile the costs of dealing with the spill are going up. The relief wells will cost $150m apiece, and the cofferdam experiment will cost millions, too. Cleaning up after a lot of oil hits the shore will raise the stakes considerably higher. Financial analysts forecast that in the worst case BP could spend as much as $12 billion fixing the mess, though it would later recoup some of that from its partners. That would be &#8220;utterly&#8221; within BP&#8217;s financial capabilities, a company spokesman says. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Being nasty to oil companies is never hard, and BP&#8217;s record over the past years has not endeared it to American public opinion. A fire at the company&#8217;s Texas City refinery in 2005 killed 15 workers and revealed what at the time was clearly a poor safety culture. The subsequent corporate soul-searching and reform was not particularly obvious to the public; the Alaskan North Slope&#8217;s largest-ever oil spill, in which at least 4,800 barrels of crude seeped out of a BP pipeline just a year later, was more noticeable. In 2007 the company paid more than $300m to settle an investigation into allegations that it had fixed the propane market in 2004. This all gives Washington the whip hand. BP&#8217;s chief executive, Tony Hayward, and Andy Inglis, the head of its upstream division, can look forward to a hard time on Capitol Hill in the weeks to come.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>From sea to slimy sea</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some legislators are talking about changing the legal limit to the amount of third-party damages the company can be sued for. This limit, which was set after the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> spill, now stands at $75m; damages above that figure are meant to be met by a federally managed disaster fund which gets its money from a small tax on oil production and imports. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who opposes drilling off that state&#8217;s shores, talks of increasing the cap to $10 billion, which would open the way for compensation claims as large as the clean-up costs. BP, aware both of the potential downside and of the harm Exxon did to its reputation as it fought off claims against it after the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>, says it will pay all &#8220;legitimate&#8221; claims, suggesting it is willing to go beyond the current cap, but not lose sight of it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then there is the question of expanding offshore drilling. The White House had shown itself willing to countenance more offshore drilling as a way of getting support from Republicans for energy and climate legislation it wants. The proposal is in some ways symbolic. Technically recoverable reserves in the Gulf of Mexico stand at around 41 billion barrels, about a quarter of them to be found in deepwater fields such as the one that the Deepwater Horizon was exploring. The amount of technically recoverable oil off the non-Gulf coasts of the lower 48 states is estimated as just 18 billion barrels, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a division of the Department of Energy. Drilling off these coasts would account for just 7% of domestic production by 2030 and have an &#8220;insignificant&#8221; impact on prices, says the EIA. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For now, the regulators&#8217; focus is on wells already drilled. The Interior Secretary, Ken Salazar, who is heading the investigation into the Deepwater Horizon accident, says production will not be halted in the Gulf, which provides about 30% of America&#8217;s 6.7m barrel-a-day output. But teams from the Minerals Management Service (MMS) have been dispatched to examine the region&#8217;s rigs, and in particular their blowout preventers. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Climate of concern</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, if lobbying by BP and other oil companies in recent years is shown&#8212;as some suspect&#8212;to have thwarted laws that might have made things safer, the oil industry&#8217;s reputation will suffer still more. And as natural-gas and oil companies press authorities in America to open more land to drillers seeking shale-gas deposits, which politicians will be comfortable accepting the argument that the cement casing of wells and the hydraulic fracturing of rocks close to water sources is risk-free?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The political implications do not stop there. The accident seems likely to strengthen the hands of environmentalists keen to turn America away from oil and towards some unconvincingly specified alternative mixture of noble abstinence, natural gas, electricity and ethanol. At the same time, it could harm the most important environmental measure currently on the table in Washington: a troubled Senate bill that might, for the first time, put a price on American emissions of carbon dioxide. Some of this legislation&#8217;s tenuous support has depended on its embrace of energy policies that many Republicans, but few environmentalists, favour: offshore drilling and nuclear power. Renewed opposition to offshore drilling could break the various constituencies apart. &#8220;The political compromise on offshore drilling is about as fragile as the Louisiana wetlands,&#8221; says Paul Bledsoe, a Clinton-era Interior Department official. &#8220;The fate of one could determine the fate of the other.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of the long-term effects of the disaster are clear. Once the oil has stopped flowing and the inquiries have finished, there will be a new, stricter, more costly and, it is to be hoped, more effective safety regime for deepwater drilling off American shores. Technologies involved in that may well also end up used elsewhere. (Some other countries already mandate safety measures America does not, though it is not clear they would have made a difference in this case.) Reforms of the MMS, a regulator widely seen as co-opted by the industry it regulates, are already under way and should pick up pace.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There may also be lasting advances in dealing with deep-sea leaks and surface spills. Robert Bea, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, points out that the drilling technologies and capabilities showcased in a structure such as Deepwater Horizon are so far beyond those of decades past as to be almost space-age. Clean-up techniques have evolved much less impressively. This may, in part, be because large spills have grown rarer as tanker technology, too, has improved. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other impacts depend on the wind, the currents and the success of the various engineering initiatives. If the flow is quickly stanched, things may get back to normal, and the respect that the engineers will surely win might even slightly brighten the oil industry&#8217;s reputation. If the leak drags on and the spill reaches unprecedented proportions the more severe political, economic and environmental consequences will start to play out. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the environmental score there is some good news. The immediate carnage that an oil spill can wreak does not normally lead to lasting environmental damage, though that may not hold for delicate wetlands already under lots of other stress. The type of crude oil coming from the Deepwater Horizon well is easier to degrade than the stuff that sometimes spills from tankers, says Eelco Leemans of the North Sea Foundation, a green lobby group. And a warmer, choppier environment is less easily damaged than the Alaskan shores that were affected by the <em>Exxon Valdez</em>. Even there, though, many think the environment has, a generation on, pretty much recovered. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One of the reasons that there is doubt as to the degree of that recovery is that there wasn&#8217;t a good record of the state of affairs before the spill for comparison. Such a survey was done before oil from the tanker <em>Sea Empress</em> hit the Welsh coast in 1996, and made it possible to monitor the quite pleasing speed of the recovery. Gulf-coast environmentalists might do well to make similar records before the black tide hits and their world is thrown, for a while, out of balance.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Falling stars</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Just when you thought it was safe to be a bank again&#8230;</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BANKS in France, Italy and Spain performed better than most in the rich world during the turmoil of 2008-09. They had smaller investment-banking operations, lower leverage, more stable funding and fewer losses. But if Lehman Brothers&#8217; collapse was unthinkable, they now face the unimaginable: fears of a sovereign-debt crisis in the euro zone. These continue to mount despite the bail-out package for Greece announced on May 2nd. European bank shares dropped by 8.5% over the course of May 4th and 5th, with Iberian firms hit hardest. Portuguese and Spanish bond yields and credit-default-swap spreads are heading up, indicating that investors reckon the odds of government defaults, though small, are rising (see chart).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The direct danger to banks from small euro-zone countries going bust is manageable. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reckons European banks&#8217; exposure to Greece and Portugal was &#8364;298 billion ($429 billion) at the end of last year, including government and private-sector counterparties. That is less than the size of Lehman&#8217;s balance-sheet, and in any case few banks have the kind of intertwined relationships with neighbouring countries as they did with the Wall Street firm. A loss of, say, a third of that amount would not be life-threatening. The top 22 European banks had Tier-1 capital of &#8364;726 billion at the end of 2009, according to CreditSights, a research firm, and made profits before tax and bad-debt charges of &#8364;184 billion last year. That is a massive safety buffer.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Furthermore the BIS data include foreign banks&#8217; subsidiaries in Greece. History suggests that, in extremis, foreign parents can ringfence local subsidiaries and decline to give them any more cash, as happened in Argentina in 2001-03. That leaves them on the hook for just their shares in the subsidiary and any loans they have made to it, not for its entire balance-sheet. Ringfencing a subsidiary in a fellow European Union country would be hard. But in a default scenario there is a real chance that parent companies might avoid taking the full hit, pushing part of it instead onto local creditors. This might help explain why France&#8217;s banks, deemed to be heavily exposed to Greece by the BIS, seem relatively unruffled by this week&#8217;s events.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is not Portugal or Greece that really scares investors, however, but the spectre of a crisis in much bigger Spain, to which Europe&#8217;s banks had some &#8364;590 billion-odd of exposure at the end of last year. Yet only the harshest of judges would say Spain is insolvent. Its public finances are no worse than those of many other rich countries, and the big banks can handle the modest sell-off in government bonds seen so far. Santander, for example, holds &#8364;27 billion of Spanish and Portuguese government paper, against Tier-1 capital of &#8364;58 billion and profits before tax and bad-debt charges of &#8364;22 billion in 2009. That is a different scale of problem from 2008, when bad assets were multiples of many banks&#8217; capital and earnings had collapsed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Could the private sector bring down Spain&#8217;s banks, in the form of dodgy property-market exposures? The central bank says loans to property developers and construction firms stood at &#8364;445 billion at the end of 2009 (of which &#8364;166 billion are judged as suspect). Against this the banks had &#8364;42 billion of specific reserves and a further &#8364;16 billion of general reserves, suggesting they could absorb a loss rate of 13%. By comparison America&#8217;s government &#8220;stress tests&#8221;, conducted a year ago, assumed a loss of 9-12% on commercial-property loans. On top of these reserves, Spain&#8217;s banks had &#8364;226 billion of equity and &#8364;57 billion of profits before taxes and bad-debt charges in 2009. Admittedly both the dodgy assets and the loss-absorbing buffers are not spread evenly. Spain&#8217;s unlisted savings banks, or <em>cajas</em>, are typically in a much worse condition than the big listed firms. Still, as a system, Spain does have a big cushion to absorb losses.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Sovereign defaults in Greece or Portugal would not in themselves bring down Europe&#8217;s banks. A crisis in Spain would, but the evidence that its government and banking system are bust is weak. Yet the lesson of the crisis in 2008-09 is that to survive, banks need to show not just that they are solvent, taking into account ongoing profits, but also that they can fund themselves if wholesale borrowing-markets gum up. Meeting this second test may be tougher. For all but the most geographically diversified banks, the sovereign-bond yield of their home country puts a floor under their own borrowing costs. If those rates rise, banks face a squeeze on their profits. In the worst case they cannot get any funds at sane prices.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Both Spanish and Portuguese banks lend more than they gather in deposits, creating a gap that capital markets fill. The listed banks are at pains to point out that the maturity profile of these debts is sensible, with, for example, only 5% or so of the total needing to be rolled over each six months for Spain&#8217;s banking system. The big two Spanish banks, Santander and BBVA, have more or less covered their refinancing needs for 2010. Portugal&#8217;s banks are typically covered, too, if you also include unencumbered assets (like government bonds) they can use to borrow from central banks. In the medium term Iberian banks hope savings rates will rise, allowing them to gather more deposits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The risk now is less about the maturity of medium- and longer-term debt, more that other counterparties such as depositors and lenders in interbank markets lose confidence and begin to pull out. There is already evidence of outsider banks discriminating between different euro-zone governments: Bank of China&#8217;s latest annual report pointedly noted problems in southern Europe. Even if a country&#8217;s overall funding profile is tolerable, deposits may start to flow from small banks to bigger, safer ones that can afford to pay high interest rates. This is already happening in Spain and will put intense pressure on the savings banks, which account for about half of the banking system. Spanish politicians agreed on May 5th to speed up mergers between wobbly <em>cajas</em>. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What, then, is needed to prevent jitters becoming a crisis? One set of tools is now all too familiar: a rapid government resolution of smaller, troubled banks, and access to liquidity for all banks, both through more relaxed rules at the European Central Bank (protecting banks against further downgrades of their collateral) and bigger and longer debt-guarantee schemes from governments to help banks roll over debts. But if governments themselves are deemed dodgy, the only solution may be to reassure creditors that there is a backstop in the form of European or IMF help for other countries in trouble. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Fear spreads</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A big rescue package for Greece has not protected other countries such as Portugal</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | LISBON | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ON MAY 2nd euro-zone governments and the IMF set out the terms of a &#8364;110 billion ($145 billion) rescue for Greece. That was far more than had previously been pledged but it was not enough to settle investors&#8217; nerves. Stockmarkets in Europe and America slumped on May 4th and fell again the next day. Greek bonds continued to trade at distressed levels. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The poor reaction in part reflects fears that rescue money could be withheld. Its disbursal depends on brutal austerity measures. Failure to carry these out could jeopardise funding and push Greece into default. Even success would leave it with an intolerable public-debt burden.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A rescue that is painful for Greece has not given other countries much relief, either. True, only a few countries are being forced into austerity by bond markets. Most rich countries, including many in the euro zone, have seen their bond yields fall since the start of the year (see chart). But the cost of public borrowing in euro-zone countries with big budget deficits, notably Portugal and Ireland but also Spain, is going in the opposite direction.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bond markets judge Portugal as the next riskiest country in the euro zone. Its bond yields jumped to 5.7% on May 5th, an increase of 1.6 percentage points since the start of the year. Its public debt reached 77% of GDP last year, about average for Europe, but its budget deficit was an alarming 9.4% of GDP. Investors fear the rising debt burden cannot be borne: GDP growth has been weaker than anywhere else in the euro zone (bar Italy) since 2000. Portugal is small, accounting for just 2% of euro-zone output and public debt. Investors who need to hold euros have other places to go.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many in Lisbon feel that Portugal is unfairly picked on. They point out that the government has played fair by the euro-zone&#8217;s fiscal rules, cutting its budget deficit from 6.1% of GDP in 2005 to 2.8% by 2008. Public-sector jobs have been cut by 10%. A 2006 reform limited real increases in pensions to years when the economy grows rapidly. Age-related spending will increase by much less than in most other parts of Europe. There has been modest progress (though not enough) in freeing up labour markets and cutting red tape. Portugal has relaxed (a bit) its stringent rules on hiring and firing. It takes less time and expense to start a business than five years ago. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It needs to do more. Portugal can be shoved around because it relies so heavily on foreign capital. Its net international debt (what Portugal owes to foreigners, less the foreign assets it owns) rose to 112% of GDP last year, after a run of huge current-account deficits. Around half of this is public debt; a slice of it is direct investment in big firms; but a worryingly large chunk, some 46% of GDP, is funnelled through the banking system. The banks&#8217; credit lines need to be rolled over and depend on the standing of public debt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Recession has helped in one respect: private-sector borrowing needs fell to zero last year from 7% of GDP in 2008, thanks to higher saving and cuts in business investment. But if Portugal is to refinance its existing debts at tolerable interest rates, it needs a lower cost of public borrowing. That will require much faster action to cut the budget deficit. The government has already pledged cuts in jobless benefits, which are generous even by euro-zone standards. Public pay could be frozen for longer. Big transport projects could be sacrificed: the government&#8217;s fetish for such schemes means the returns to further investment are likely to be low. Selling state stakes in big firms could yield as much as &#8364;15 billion, enough to cover last year&#8217;s deficit. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are some small mercies among the savagery. One is the steady fall in the euro, a victim of the crisis (see ). That ought to help Portugal sell into markets it has tried to target&#8212;in Angola, Brazil, China and America. Another is that some pain will fall on foreign suppliers: uncompetitive countries, such as Greece, Portugal and Spain, tend to suck in lots of imports when their domestic spending is strong. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Greek chorus of boos</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Other countries will be nervously watching what amounts to an economic experiment</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVERY entertainer knows the feeling. You put on what you think is a great show and the audience responds with a giant raspberry. The rescue package for Greece that was unveiled on May 2nd was rewarded with a renewed plunge in the euro and further falls in Spanish and Portuguese government bonds, the next economies in the markets&#8217; sights.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An obvious historical parallel is with 1992 when the British government was fighting to keep the pound within Europe&#8217;s exchange-rate mechanism. On September 16th, or &#8220;Black Wednesday&#8221;, the government increased interest rates in two steps from 10% to 15% only for the pound to keep falling. Investors simply did not believe that the government would inflict that much pain on its citizens in order to defend the currency. And the markets were right. The pound was out of the ERM by the evening.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Greece may have been guaranteed enough money to deal with its immediate funding needs, but two questions linger. The first is whether its government has the will to push through the accompanying austerity package in the face of public protests. And the second is whether the package will only make matters worse, by locking Greece into endless recession. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Deficit hawks might point to another British parallel, the 1981 budget, in which Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s government unveiled an austerity package in the middle of a recession. A group of 364 economists (including the present governor of the Bank of England) signed a letter to the <em>Times</em> newspaper denouncing the government&#8217;s folly. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To the economists, Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s approach was positively antediluvian. Had not the Depression taught that attempts to balance the budget would only worsen an economic downturn? Yet the British economy, far from relapsing into slump, enjoyed a prolonged boom for the rest of the 1980s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But Mrs Thatcher&#8217;s efforts at deficit reduction were accompanied by sharp falls in short-term interest rates and a currency depreciation. Those two options are not open to the Greeks. Of course, Greece may be able to cut its long-term bond yields if the austerity plan is pushed through. Because such yields determine the borrowing costs of banks and firms, long-term yields are arguably more important than short-term rates in driving growth. But the massive jump in Greek bond yields dates back only to December 2009. That puts Greece in rather a different position from early-1980s Britain, which had suffered high long-term rates for several years. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Greek austerity plan is as close as you can get to a real-time experiment: what happens to an economy when one policy variable is changed and others are fixed? Ireland is conducting a similar test and the news is not that encouraging; its GDP fell by 2.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. In Latvia, the pain has been even greater; its GDP fell by 18% last year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A previous example of the widespread use of fiscal-austerity programmes was during the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. These initiatives were generally blamed for making the crisis worse. The IMF was in favour of such measures at the time but has since changed its tune. It called for co-ordinated fiscal stimulus packages to deal with the credit crunch.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So why is Greece being forced to take the opposite tack? It is an extreme case. The combination of sluggish growth, a budget deficit above 10% of GDP, a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 100% and high bond yields is unsustainable. The private sector will no longer finance the Greek government and other EU nations, now required to bail out the spendthrift Hellenes, are insisting on a high price to appease their own voters. Other countries are not (yet) in as bad a position.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Even so, they will still be watching the Greek crisis closely, as they contemplate their own deficit-reduction programmes. It may be a noble ambition to reduce the debt burden of future generations. But if the price is a return to recession and massive electoral unpopularity, few politicians will relish the task. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More broadly, some of the contradictions inherent in the economic (and market) rebound are coming to the surface. The rally has been driven by the impact of government stimulus but there comes a point when a government can no longer stimulate. Without the prospect of a return to robust long-term economic growth, stimulus packages may at best be just spreading the pain over a longer period. At worst, they may be creating an even bigger problem for the future.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>In a world of ugly currencies, the dollar is sitting pretty</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES once likened investing to judging a beauty contest. For today&#8217;s currency investor, however, none of the main contestants looks that fetching. &#8220;It&#8217;s more like an ugliness contest,&#8221; says one hedge-fund manager. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The dollar, for all its blemishes, is the least hideous-looking. So far this year it has risen against the other main currencies (the yen, pound and euro) that are traded internationally and held as reserves by central banks. It has risen most against the euro, which started the year at $1.43 but bought just $1.28 on May 6th (see chart). The euro has slumped in part because the Greek crisis makes it look a poor choice for reserve managers hoping to diversify their big dollar holdings. The variable quality of euro sovereign bonds is now much harder to ignore. Treasury bonds, with their liquid markets and unique issuer, look prettier. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The case for a further drop in the euro against the dollar has more than just momentum to back it. Business cycles favour it: the euro-area economy is picking up speed again, but America&#8217;s recovery is more advanced. The pressure to tighten fiscal policy in some parts of the euro area will make it hard for the European Central Bank to even consider raising interest rates. A weaker euro also addresses the deeper cause of the present crisis: a lack of export competitiveness in the south of the currency zone. It does not help Greece, Portugal and the rest compete with Germany, but it at least gives their firms a chance against imports from outside the euro bloc. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A cheaper euro hurts America, which will feel it is owed a chance for export-led growth after almost ruining itself as the world&#8217;s main consumer. By most fair-value gauges, the euro is still dear against the dollar, notwithstanding its recent slide. Even so, a weaker euro may crystallise a feeling that Europe is not doing its bit to support global demand.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Are there any beautiful currencies left? A handful had comfortably outpaced the dollar this year before the latest market tremors had investors grasping for greenbacks. Two such currencies are the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Both are issued by rich countries with stable banks that have not sullied the public finances. Another is the South Korean won. Brazil&#8217;s real may over time develop as a reliable store of value. The trouble is, securities issued in these currencies are a tiny fraction of those available in the world&#8217;s four main currencies, says Stephen Jen of BlueGold Capital, a hedge fund. The lack of scale and liquidity limits their role as reserve currencies. The dollar has those plainer qualities in abundance. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Private inequity</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Investors push for more favourable fees and terms, and get them</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;THERE&#8217;S never been a better time&#8221; for institutional investors &#8220;to press our case&#8221;, says Joseph Dear, chief investment officer of CalPERS, America&#8217;s largest public-pension fund. &#8220;We&#8217;re determined to make the most of it.&#8221; So far Mr Dear has been true to his word. Last month CalPERS persuaded Apollo Global Management, a large private-equity firm, to scrap $125m in fees over five years. Mr Dear plans to bargain aggressively with other private-equity firms (known as &#8220;general partners&#8221;) to bring down fees, and he has urged other investors (&#8220;limited partners&#8221;) to do the same.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>During the buy-out boom, general partners could levy high fees and investors would still flock to them. But now fund-raising is a challenge. Private-equity firms raised a paltry $50 billion in the first quarter of this year, compared with nearly $167 billion in the first quarter of 2008 (see chart). Investors are banding together to get better deals. In September the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA), a network of institutional investors in private equity, issued a set of best practices that general partners should consider accepting if they want limited partners&#8217; business. It calls for greater transparency, more favourable contractual terms and more generous profit-sharing. It is hardly &#8220;The Communist Manifesto&#8221;, but it has sent ripples through the industry. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Proponents of ILPA&#8217;s guidelines say they have helped limited partners negotiate lower fees. Private-equity firms have typically charged investors a 2% management fee, which is intended to cover the basic costs of running their business. Limited partners insist that management fees shouldn&#8217;t be a source of profit for general partners, and in some cases are demanding to sit down with them to find out what their real costs are. As a result, the average management fee at buy-out firms trying to raise capital fell by 20 basis points between 2008 and 2009, to just over 1.8%, according to Preqin, a research firm. Larger firms cut their fees the most.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Investors are also attacking the issue of &#8220;deal fees&#8221;, which general partners charge the companies they own for such services as completing transactions and advising them. For example, when a trio of private-equity firms bought HCA, a health-care services giant, in 2006, they charged HCA a $175m transaction fee for completing the deal. These types of fees used to go into the pockets of general partners but limited partners think they are entitled to a cut. Limited partners have successfully negotiated deals to get the bulk of them, and an 80-20 split is now the norm.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Firms are making other concessions, too. Some funds, such as Bain Capital and TPG Capital, have allowed investors to recall some of their capital commitments. Investors are also pushing to add or raise hurdles, which require that general partners reach a certain threshold of returns before they start earning profits themselves. They also want to make sure their contracts contain &#8220;no-fault divorce&#8221; clauses, which make it easier for investors to remove a general partner or terminate the partnership. Only 72% of contracts contained this clause in 2007; 95% of them did in 2009.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Regulations could change these dynamics, says Colin Blaydon, a professor at Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. A proposal being considered by Congress to treat general partners&#8217; profits as income rather than capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate, could cut into margins and make them less willing to make concessions to limited partners. For now, though, investors are enjoying the upper hand. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Shafted</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The economic and political justification of a tax grab</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | HONG KONG | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>HIGH commodities prices should mean happiness for the mining industry. Instead, they spell vulnerability. On May 2nd Australia, the industry&#8217;s largest source of many minerals, proposed a new, 40% tax on what it defines as &#8220;super profits&#8221;. A decline in the price of Australian mining shares that began in April, as word of the new tax emerged, accelerated sharply (see chart). Some fear that other governments could follow suit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Squeezing natural-resources firms is hardly unprecedented&#8212;even in Australia itself, which imposed a surcharge on oil exploration decades ago during a prior boom. The politics are appealing. Natural resources are seen by many as a national patrimony, meaning all profits should be shared. Kevin Rudd, Australia&#8217;s prime minister, noted that hefty chunks of two big mining companies with listings in Australia, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, are held by foreign shareholders. That, said Mr Rudd, means a lot of benefits from Australian resources have gone to non-Australians. It helps too that supporters of the Labor government do not live in Western Australia, where the country&#8217;s big mineral deposits are located and the taxes will be paid.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The economics of the new tax are trickier. Because mining firms comprise a large slice of the Australian stockmarket, the decline has had a big impact on other investors too. The very fact that the government can impose a special tax on one industry will have investors worried about similar measures being applied elsewhere. That should, in theory at least, mean they will charge higher costs for their funding.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As for the mining companies themselves, they have little choice about where to operate but they will inevitably reorganise their financial structures to be tax-efficient. That would mean shifting more costs into Australian operations to depress reported profits. It may also mean that miners alter their capital structures to put more emphasis on debt, which is tax-deductible, rather than equity. If so, increases in leverage would increase their vulnerability to swings in commodity prices. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The outright impact of the tax, along with how it is applied (notably whether projects with losses can be netted against projects with gains), could have a severe impact on the Australian resource sector, says Ray Ball, a professor at the University of Chicago&#8217;s Booth School of Business and a scathing critic of similar measures back in 1984. At least one deal, a bid by Peabody Energy for Macarthur Coal, was being reassessed after this week&#8217;s announcement.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Rudd government argues that investment will not be impeded because the tax is applied to profits beyond what is necessary to fund reinvestment&#8212;likely to be a rate lower than the government-bond yield plus five percentage points. That has the potential to inspire furious debate beyond mining. The claim that a fair rate of return can be set by fiat, rather than the market, for an industry that is prone to booms and busts has obvious appeal elsewhere. The IMF&#8217;s proposals for new bank taxes already nod towards the idea of creaming off excess profits. Miners may be miserable now, but banks also have reason to worry about events down under. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>J'accuse</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>J\xE9r\xF4me Kerviel publishes a book ahead of his trial next month</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE &#8220;fabulous Fab&#8221;&#8212;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs banker charged alongside his employer with misleading investors&#8212;has dominated recent headlines about French investment bankers. But J\xE9r\xF4me Kerviel, the Soci\xE9t\xE9 G\xE9n\xE9rale trader whose rogue bets lost his bank &#8364;4.9 billion ($7.2 billion) in early 2008, has returned to compete for the limelight. In a new book published this week, in which he presents himself as the victim of an immoral financial system, Mr Kerviel intensifies his attacks on his old bosses at SocGen. His trial, in which he faces up to five years in prison and a fine of &#8364;375,000, is due to start in Paris on June 8th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Kerviel cleverly concealed the bets he was making with a series of offsetting transactions with fictional counterparties. He admits as much in his book. But numerous colleagues, he says, also used to enter false information into SocGen&#8217;s trading system, if not on as large a scale. And contrary to the charges against him, he says in the book, he never used colleagues&#8217; passwords or hacked into back-office systems to cover his tracks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Kerviel&#8217;s courtroom defence will be that his bosses were aware of what he was doing but turned a blind eye while he was churning out profits. In late 2007 Eurex, a futures exchange, wrote to SocGen expressing worries over the size of Mr Kerviel&#8217;s positions over the year. According to Mr Kerviel&#8217;s book, his bosses not only ignored Eurex&#8217;s warning but told him not to reveal his trading strategy and to stay vague in his response to the exchange.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For SocGen, the best outcome is that it looks supremely incompetent at monitoring its trader. According to a report by a committee of independent directors, SocGen&#8217;s back-office system threw up no fewer than 74 alerts before the bank finally confronted Mr Kerviel in January 2008. In July 2007, for instance, a back-office employee alerted managers to two trades with what they identified as fake counterparties with a face value of &#8364;7 billion. No further action was taken even though Mr Kerviel&#8217;s explanations &#8220;lacked credibility&#8221;, according to the employee.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SocGen has spent much of the past two years trying to put Mr Kerviel behind it. Under new management, it quickly moved to raise &#8364;5.5 billion of new capital after the scandal, and now has a strong core Tier-1 ratio of 8.5%. It has overhauled its risk management. It reported strong results for the first quarter this week. But the Kerviel affair is still not quite over. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Policymakers are experimenting with ways to stop a property boom</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN AMERICA policymakers are too busy coping with the aftermath of the last housing bubble to worry about preventing the next one. But elsewhere in the world, things are different. In China&#8217;s cities, house prices rose by 11.7% in the year to March, according to official estimates, and by much more, according to unofficial ones. That is one reason why the central bank raised reserve requirements (the share of deposits banks must keep in their vaults) on May 2nd for the third time this year. In Canada, the Canadian Real Estate Association calculates that homes were worth 17.6% more in March than a year earlier, taking them well above their pre-crisis peak. And down under home values only seem to go up, rising by 20% in Australia&#8217;s eight state capitals in the first three months of this year, compared with a year earlier.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How should policymakers respond? In a December speech, Adam Posen, an economist who sits on the Bank of England&#8217;s rate-setting committee, complained that policymakers need a bigger toolkit. Before the crisis many central bankers believed that all they needed was a &#8220;hammer&#8221; (interest rates) to strike a &#8220;monetary nail&#8221; (consumer-price inflation). But not every problem is a nail. Policymakers also need a full set of &#8220;macroprudential&#8221; tools, from wrenches to duct tape.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To fix housing bubbles, Mr Posen suggests, policymakers should consider a tax on real estate that varies over the cycle, rising in property booms and falling in busts. His suggestion echoes an idea proposed a year earlier by Olivier Jeanne of Johns Hopkins University. According to Mr Jeanne, debt, including mortgage debt, is like pollution. It imposes costs on others that the borrower fails to take into account. The right response to an externality of this kind is to tax it&#8212;to make the polluter pay.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a preliminary paper, he and Anton Korinek of the University of Maryland spell out the logic further. When people borrow to buy houses (or any other asset), they push up the price. This raises the value of the collateral against which borrowing is secured. It then becomes easier to borrow to buy homes, which pushes prices even higher. This &#8220;financial accelerator&#8221; (a term coined by Ben Bernanke, now chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark Gertler of New York University and Simon Gilchrist of Boston University) operates in reverse during a downturn. Falling prices erode the value of collateral, tightening credit and depressing demand. When they take on debt, borrowers fail to take into account the effect of their actions on the collateral constraints faced by others. To offset this, Mr Jeanne proposes a counter-cyclical tax on debt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No one really knows how well such measures would work. But economists have increasing amounts of evidence to sift, mainly from Asia. As Jaime Caruana of the Bank of International Settlements pointed out recently: &#8220;Asian central banks have taken the lead in implementing various macroprudential tools.&#8221; He cited the Reserve Bank of India, which in 2005 began requiring banks to make larger provisions against losses from property loans, among other things. It also forced them to set aside more capital. These measures had a big effect on commercial-property lending, which grew by only 26.7% in the year to February 2008, having grown by almost 160% in the year to August 2005.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hong Kong&#8217;s property market has endured some wild gyrations, falling by more than 70% from 1997 to 2003. But because Hong Kong&#8217;s currency is pegged to the dollar, its central bank cannot use the interest-rate hammer even if it wanted to. Instead it has relied on macroprudential policies. In the early 1990s it told banks to lend homebuyers no more than 70% of the value of a home, and to limit their exposure to the property market to 40%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Singapore and China, policymakers are now trying something similar. In February the Singapore authorities barred lenders from making loans for more than 80% of the value of a home. It also imposed a stamp duty on all residential properties sold within a year of purchase. In April China&#8217;s cabinet, the State Council, said it would increase downpayment requirements on second and third homes, as well as big first homes. It set a floor on mortgage rates and ordered cash-rich state-owned enterprises to stop moonlighting as property developers. According to the <em>Economic Observer</em>, a Chinese weekly newspaper, it has also decided to subject some swanky homes to a property tax that previously excluded homes occupied by their owners.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Wrenching changes</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the West central banks are happy to set interest rates for the economy as a whole, but prefer to let the market decide who should lend how much to whom. In emerging markets, central banks are happier to get their hands dirty in the credit-allocation process, arm-twisting banks, favouring some industries with credit and discriminating against others. Some Western policymakers are now following Asia&#8217;s lead. Since April 19th house buyers in Canada have had to make a downpayment of at least 20% on investment properties they do not occupy themselves. And even though variable mortgage rates are low (just 1.75%, according to the Bank of Canada), borrowers must meet the creditworthiness standards required for a five-year, fixed-rate mortgage. These measures should make households less vulnerable to the hammer blows that will fall when the Bank of Canada raises rates.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Besides, policymakers in places like America, Australia and Canada are happy to offer temporary tax breaks to homebuyers in a bust. Symmetry demands they raise taxes on homeowners in a boom. Until February 1st Canadians could claim a tax credit of up to C$1,350 ($1,180) for home renovations such as installing a hot tub. If governments are prepared to subsidise bubbly baths, they can surely bring themselves to tax bubbly markets. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>A cave man blinking in the light</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The DNA of modern humanity&#8217;s closest extinct relative is undergoing detailed analysis</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;KNOW thyself&#8221; was the admonition over the entrance to the oracle at Delphi. Good advice, but hard to follow unless you have points of comparison with others from which to derive such knowledge. That is one reason why the uniqueness of <em>Homo sapiens</em> is difficult to fathom. The evolutionary processes that have made people so different from other animals are hard to determine without an ability to examine human species that have not, in the words of Douglas Adams, achieved &#8220;New York, wars and so on&#8221;. In a scientific <em>tour de force</em>, however, Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig and his colleagues have made such a comparison possible. They have published, in this week&#8217;s <em>Science</em>, an analysis of the genome of Neanderthal man. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><em>Homo neanderthalensis</em>, to give its proper name, lived in Europe and parts of Asia from 400,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago. Towards the end of this period it shared its range with interlopers in the form of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, which was spreading out from Africa, but the two species did not settle down to a stable cohabitation. For reasons which are yet unknown, the arrival of <em>Homo sapiens</em> in a region was always quickly followed by the disappearance of Neanderthals.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Paabo had announced that he had the Neanderthal genome in February 2009, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At that time, however, his team had conducted only a superficial comparison between the DNA of Neanderthals and modern humans. Now they have performed a more thorough study, and in doing so have shed a fascinating light on the intertwined history of the two species.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Kissing cousins</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That history turns out to be more intertwined than many had previously believed. Dr Paabo and his colleagues compared their Neanderthal genome (painstakingly reconstructed from three bone samples collected from a cave in Croatia) with that of five living humans from various parts of Africa and Eurasia. Previous genetic analysis, which examined DNA passed from mother to child in cellular structures called mitochondria, had suggested no interbreeding between Neanderthals and modern humans. The new, more extensive examination, which looks at DNA in the cell nucleus, shows this conclusion is wrong. By comparing the DNA of Africans (whose ancestors could not have crossbred with Neanderthals, since they did not overlap with them) and various Eurasians (whose ancestors could have crossbred with Neanderthals), Dr Paabo has shown that Eurasians are between 1% and 4% Neanderthal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is intriguing. It shows that even after several hundred thousand years of separation, the two species were interfertile. It is curious, though, that no Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA has turned up in modern humans, since the usual pattern of invasion, in historical times anyway, is for the invaders&#8217; males to mate with the invaded&#8217;s females.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One piece of self-knowledge, then&#8212;at least for non-Africans&#8212;is that they have a dash of Neanderthal in them. But Dr Paabo&#8217;s work also illuminates the differences between the species. By comparing modern humans, Neanderthals and chimpanzees it is possible to distinguish genetic changes shared by several species of human in their evolution away from the great-ape lineage from those that are unique to <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More than 90% of the &#8220;human accelerated regions&#8221; that have been identified in modern people are found in Neanderthals, too. But the rest are not. Dr Paabo has identified 212 parts of the genome that seem to have undergone significant evolution since the species split. The state of genome science is still quite primitive, and it is often unclear what any given bit of DNA is actually doing. But an examination of the 20 largest regions that have evolved in this way shows that they include several genes associated with cognitive ability&#8212;and whose malfunction causes serious mental problems. The presence of an extra copy of <em>DYRK1A</em> is linked to Down&#8217;s syndrome; mutation of <em>NRG3</em> is linked to schizophrenia; mutations of <em>CADPS2</em> and <em>AUTS2</em> are linked to autism. These four genes therefore look like good places to start the search for modern humanity&#8217;s essence.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The newly evolved regions also include a gene called <em>RUNX2</em>, which controls bone growth. That may account for differences in the shape of the skull and the rib cage between the two species. By contrast an earlier phase of the study had already shown that Neanderthals and moderns share the same version of a gene called <em>FOXP2</em>, which is involved in the ability to speak and which differs in chimpanzees. It is all, then, very promising&#8212;and a second coup in quick succession for Dr Paabo. In March another of his teams revealed the existence of a hitherto unsuspected species of human using mitochondrial DNA found in a little-finger bone. If that species, too, could have its full genome read, humanity&#8217;s ability to know itself would be enhanced even further.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    \r\n\
    <p>OVER the years, electronics have found their way into almost every aspect of human life. They are in homes, offices, cars and just about all gadgets. Some electronic circuits have also made their way into the bodies of people in the form of heart pacemakers and cochlear implants. Now new kinds of bodily electronics are coming.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most electronics are made in the form of integrated circuits, which are tiny chips that contain transistors and other components etched onto silicon wafers. While fine for computers and other products, they are inflexible and cannot be easily wrapped around curved surfaces or pliable ones, making them hard to be used in the body. Researchers have devised ways to make flexible electronics, for such things as electronic paper. Now, John Rogers of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, who is one of the pioneers of flexible electronics, has devised a new technique to create ultra-thin and flexible circuits suitable for medical use.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Rogers first fabricated a mesh containing a circuit of silicon electronics by thinning silicon until it becomes flexible. But this causes a problem. Since it is so thin, it soon collapses. To avoid this, Dr Rogers deposited the circuit onto a special silk to provide structural support without sacrificing flexibility. The silk was engineered by Tufts University, near Boston, from a silkworm cocoon that had been boiled to create a silk solution that can be deposited as a thin film. When the film containing the circuit is placed on biological tissue, it dissolves naturally. What it leaves behind is the circuit, attached to the tissue by capillary forces and supported by it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To apply his technique to medicine, Dr Rogers has teamed up with Brian Litt of the University of Pennsylvania, a neurology expert interested in creating electronic implants to monitor and treat epilepsy. In a paper recently published in <em>Nature Materials</em> the pair explained how they placed one of Dr Rogers&#8217;s silk-supported electronic meshes on the exposed brain of an anaesthetised cat. After the silk dissolved, the electrodes in the mesh followed the contours of the cat&#8217;s brain and were able to detect neurological activity more accurately than conventional implanted electrodes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Next, Dr Rogers and Dr Litt hope to test the technique on epileptic dogs to see if the electrodes can detect seizures. Eventually it may be possible to use such circuits to prevent epileptic seizures. Other applications could include electrically stimulated repairs to spinal injuries or controlling drug delivery inside the body. For such applications it may even be possible to engineer circuits and components that dissolve once they have done their work. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A way to fly a balloon in and out of the stratosphere</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ACCORDING to the old adage, what goes up must come down. But in the case of balloons, the descent sometimes comes sooner than expected. Although helium-filled weather balloons regularly launch instruments high into the stratosphere, at altitudes of 20km (65,000 feet) the air is 15 times less dense, causing the balloons to expand and ultimately burst. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This problem has long vexed the American military, which would like to use lighter-than-air dirigibles as atmospheric satellites, or stratellites. From 20km a blimp would be able to continuously survey an area the size of Texas for months at a time, but in greater detail and at much lower cost than geostationary satellites or those moving in low Earth orbit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite the problems, dirigibles are coming back into service. Global Telesat Corporation, an American supplier of unmanned aerial vehicles, recently purchased its first SkySat. This 38 metre-long remotely operated airship is designed to carry communications and monitoring equipment for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. With its familiar cigar-shaped design, however, it will rise only so far&#8212;14km, to be precise. And at this altitude ferocious winds require a SkySat to burn through its fuel supply just to stay still. As a result it can remain aloft for only a few days at a time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The ultimate goal is to find a way to slip above the jet stream and into the virtually windless stratosphere for an even better vantage point, says Dan Erdberg of Sanswire, a Florida company which developed SkySat. Over the years the company has looked at various solutions, and it is now working with Global Telesat to develop a novel, snakelike airship called the STS-111. It is made up of four connected and articulated inflatable sections. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Each section of the STS-111 contains two gas envelopes&#8212;one inside the other. The inner envelope holds helium in the head section of the blimp and an ethane fuel gas in the three tail sections. The outer envelope of all four sections contains air maintained at atmospheric pressure. Although the airship starts off flaccid, the helium and the ethane expand as it gains altitude. As it does so, the air in the outer envelope is released to allow these gases to fill the void left behind. This approach gives the gases more room to expand without stretching the envelope of the airship too much. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Venting gases is not a new idea, says Mr Erdberg, but usually it involves releasing helium, which reduces the buoyancy of the craft, so that making a safe descent or maintaining a steady altitude becomes extremely difficult. What makes Sanswire&#8217;s design unique is that it allows the airship to have the same weight on landing as it did when it took off. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is because air is pumped back into the tail envelopes as the ethane fuel is burned by the craft&#8217;s thrusters, and is also pumped into the tail and head during descent as the inner envelopes contract. The serpentine aerofoil shape is designed to face into what little wind there is, generating a small amount of lift. And since ethane has roughly the same density as air, the fuel in effect weighs nothing, further reducing the amount of helium needed to create buoyancy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is the theory, at least. So far, apart from some low-altitude test flights, the only stratospheric tests have involved a scaled-down version tethered to a weather balloon. Tests of a full-sized STS-111 at high altitude are not expected to begin until next year. So the military will have to wait a bit longer to see if Sanswire&#8217;s ideas hold up&#8212;or its claims are inflated. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The almost-winning addiction</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Near misses could heighten gambling addiction</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS not the thrill of winning, but the thrill of almost winning that sets a problem gambler apart from those who just fancy a flutter. A strong reaction in the brain in response to &#8220;near misses&#8221; is correlated with a greater tendency to compulsive gambling, according to new research.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Gambling touches almost everyone, from friends playing online poker to grannies buying lotto tickets. For many it is just good fun, but for some it becomes a debilitating addiction which wrecks lives: they need bigger wins to satisfy their craving, and when forced to stop they suffer withdrawal symptoms. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Henry Chase of the University of Nottingham and Luke Clark of the University of Cambridge, are interested in the cognitive complexities of gamblers. For instance, gamblers often believe that games like roulette, or picking lottery numbers, involve some degree of skill, even though they do not. In games where skill does matter, such as football, a near miss like kicking a ball into the goalpost can rightly be associated with almost scoring a goal. So assigning value to an almost-goal makes some sense. But in games of chance, near misses are meaningless. They say nothing about the future likelihood of winning. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet that is not the way many people think about it. Dr Chase and Dr Clark have found that in normal healthy volunteers, near misses that won participants not a penny still activated parts of the brain associated with monetary wins. In a new study in the <em>Journal of Neuroscience</em> they set out to discover just how that brain activation was related to gambling &#8220;severity&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>They invited 20 volunteers, two of whom were women, to play a kind of slot machine while a functional magnetic-resonance imaging scanner examined their brain activity. These machines show certain parts of the brain &#8220;lighting up&#8221; with increased blood flow as they become active.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The volunteers all enjoyed some gambling, ranging from off-course betting on race horses and football matches to playing slot machines, scratch cards and lotteries. All but one volunteer&#8212;who had been abstinent for a year&#8212;gambled at least once a week. Bets ranged from five people who routinely spent \xA310-100 ($15-150) a day on gambling and two who were willing to drop over \xA310,000. Perhaps not surprisingly, 13 of the volunteers would have been considered to have an excessive gambling habit on conventional tests.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The game was simple: when an icon on the left-hand reel lined up with the same icon on a right-hand one, the volunteer won a cash prize of 50 pence (75 cents). Sometimes the volunteers could pick the left-hand icon. At other times it was selected for them. A near miss came with the agonising deceleration of the right-hand reel so that something like a cowboy boot, an anchor or a banana eventually stopped within a space or two of lining up with a matching icon on the left. In fact, the results were rigged and all participants got 30 wins, 60 near misses and 90 clear misses.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The researchers found that those who scored highest in gambling severity also showed the most activity in the midbrain area in response to near misses. (They did not differ in their response to real wins, however.) This area of the brain is of interest to researchers because it is where dopamine, a neurotransmitter, is produced. Dopamine has been implicated in other addiction studies. It could be the near misses that enhance dopamine transmission in gamblers who suffer the most severe problems, the study suggests. Which means it might be possible to find treatments that reduce dopamine transmission in the brain to take some of the compulsion out of gambling. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Efficient shapes</h1>\r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>WHAT is the most efficient shape for randomly packing things into a container? Physicists at New York University and Virginia Tech have carried out a series of experiments and, among all the shapes they have tested so far, the tetrahedron (a pyramid with four triangular sides) takes some beating. The researchers poured tetrahedral dice into containers which they shook until completely full. A magnetic-resonance imaging scanner was then used to see how tightly the dice packed themselves (pictured above). To quantify the packing efficiency, the researchers poured water into the containers to measure the amount of space between the dice. They report in the latest issue of Physical Review Letters that the tetrahedra filled roughly 76% of the available space in a large container, whereas experiments with spheres typically filled only 64% of the available volume. The physicists say the data will be useful when calculating, for example, how liquids seep through soils of different densities. They think the work might also have some use in packaging consumer products. Watch out for tetrahedral tomatoes.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    \r\n\
    <p>REINFORCEMENTS arrived too late at the site of the bloodiest military defeat suffered by whites in their settlement of the American West. They had, they told a shocked nation celebrating its centenary, found only a single survivor on the battlefield, a veteran bleeding from the wounds of seven bullets and arrows. With the help of a sling, the bay gelding Comanche was gently conveyed to a ship for medical treatment. A general order was issued later saying that as &#8220;the only living representative&#8221; of the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Comanche&#8217;s &#8220;kind treatment and comfort should be a matter of special pride and solicitude&#8221; for the Seventh Cavalry. Henceforth he would not be ridden. Neither would he be put to any work.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such sentimentality towards animals helped cavalrymen retain their humanity. The scenes, sounds and even smells of their brutalised lives suffuse Nathaniel Philbrick&#8217;s gory account of the campaign against the Plains Indians, commanded by General Alfred Terry, that culminated in the catastrophic end, in June 1876, of George Armstrong Custer. Mr Philbrick proves here as fine a writer on land as he is at sea, where he is famed for his history of the whaler that inspired Herman Melville&#8217;s &#8220;Moby Dick&#8221; and for arguing plausibly in his &#8220;Sea of Glory&#8221; that the ocean, not the West, was America&#8217;s first frontier.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His military biography of Custer brings balance to a life that is often distorted by the preconceptions of the historian. This also happens, as the author notes, in films where Custer, a noble hero in Raoul Walsh&#8217;s &#8220;They Died With Their Boots On&#8221; (1941), becomes a deranged maniac in Arthur Penn&#8217;s &#8220;Little Big Man&#8221; (1970). In reality he was a fine soldier, &#8220;one of the best cavalry officers, if not the best, in the Union Army&#8221; in the American civil war. Tragically for his men, his military successes there, and in later wars against the Indians, induced a hubris that led Custer to make some catastrophic decisions at Little Bighorn. While Custer divided his forces, Sitting Bull consolidated. Ever since his boyhood the Indian chief had been renowned for a methodical manner. His intimates nicknamed him &#8220;Slow&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Custer also overestimated the stamina and hardiness of his troops. His regiment was not made up of gnarled Marlboro men; many were born abroad, 17% of them in Ireland, 12% in Germany and 4% in England. Almost all its native-born Americans came from east of the Mississippi. For these men, says Mr Philbrick, the Plains were a strange and unworldly place. They found it hard to accustom themselves to the constant eye-watering reek of horse hair and human sweat. The stench was especially bad at night when they camped near their newly dug latrines. If it was too wet to light a fire, they had to subsist on hardtack biscuits and cold sowbelly doused in vinegar. Since their boots shrank when they dried, troopers had to keep them on at night.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Their mounts were often famished, tired and weighed down by equipment, whereas the ponies of Sitting Bull&#8217;s warriors were well-watered, fresh and, in many cases, barebacked. Controversially, Mr Philbrick claims that Sitting Bull&#8217;s men were better armed, citing the findings of an archaeological sweep of the battlefield with metal detectors in the 1980s. In addition to the Springfield carbines and Colt revolvers fired by the soldiers, there were 43 weapons used by the Indians. Some were old muzzle-loaders, but up to 300 Indians possessed Henry and Winchester repeating rifles capable of firing 17 rounds without reloading. Custer&#8217;s men, with their single-shot carbines, were &#8220;overwhelmingly outgunned&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In American military mythology Custer&#8217;s last stand ranks alongside the Battle of the Alamo, an attack by Mexican forces on a compound in Texas, which left all the defenders dead. Indian war buffs will be absorbed by Mr Philbrick&#8217;s intelligent, yet necessarily speculative, reconstruction of Custer&#8217;s reckless encounter. Others will be even more intrigued by the author&#8217;s vivid recreation of the tribulations of 19th-century cavalrymen. And of their horses, especially Comanche. His stuffed remains reside at the University of Kansas.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>Losing Control: The Emerging Threats to Western Prosperity. </strong>By Stephen King. <em>Yale University Press; 246 pages; $30. Published in Britain by Yale University Press as &#8220;Losing Control: Why the West&#8217;s Economic Prosperity Can No Longer be Taken for Granted&#8221;; \xA320. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>YOU might expect a book on the rise of emerging markets by the chief economist of HSBC to be a rose-tinted puff piece. After all, HSBC is one of the global banks that has the biggest presence in the emerging world. You would be mistaken. Stephen King may be employed by a firm that is profiting handily from the emerging giants&#8217; prosperity, but his assessment of the impact of that rise on the West is provocatively pessimistic. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The rich world&#8217;s policymakers, he argues, have been far too complacent about how emerging markets might affect the West&#8217;s future prosperity and the workings of the world economy. As the book&#8217;s title suggests, Mr King reckons the rise of the emerging giants means Western countries will increasingly forfeit control over their economic destiny. They will face far greater competition for scarce resources, such as commodities, even as the globalisation of labour markets decreases their workers&#8217; bargaining power. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Emerging economies&#8217; rising heft will also undermine some of the cushy global arrangements that have benefited the West, such as, in America&#8217;s case, the dollar&#8217;s reserve-currency status. The result will be a dramatic redistribution of income, a rapid erosion of the West&#8217;s relative economic clout and, for many Western citizens, an end to the cosy expectations of ever rising living standards. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The book ranges widely: from a quasi-Malthusian discussion of the impact of limited resources to the more familiar territory of how wage competition from emerging economies influences income inequality. But the main focus is a discussion of global capital markets and the international monetary system. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr King writes that the rise of emerging economies has distorted the traditional macroeconomic indicators in ways that Western policymakers have been too slow to appreciate. As emerging economies push the prices of commodities up and those of manufactured goods down, consumer-price inflation is no longer a reflection of domestic monetary conditions, nor is low inflation a guarantor of economic stability. At the same time emerging economies&#8217; behaviour, particularly the accumulation of massive foreign-exchange reserves, has distorted capital markets by artificially pushing down long-term interest rates. The combination of state-led investment decisions in the emerging world and a parochial focus on price stability in the rich world produced serial asset bubbles rather than efficient capital allocation. Or, as Mr King puts it, &#8220;a gold rush&#8221; in which ordinary investors gained little. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> What&#8217;s more, Mr King reckons today&#8217;s international monetary system is unsustainable. Though emerging economies&#8217; excess saving will not disappear quickly (he is unconvinced, for instance, that a stronger Chinese currency would make much difference), Mr King believes these rising giants will be increasingly unwilling to hold the bulk of their reserves in dollars. A shift away from the dollar would raise America&#8217;s borrowing costs and reduce its long-run growth potential.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr King lays out his arguments in accessible and engaging prose. He is a lively writer with a deft eye for catchy historical analogies. He likens America&#8217;s foreign borrowing to the sale of indulgences by medieval Catholic priests for instance, and wonders what will be the financial equivalent of the Protestant Reformation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It is hard to dispute Mr King&#8217;s basic macroeconomic instincts&#8212;that the effect emerging economies are having on the world economy is considerable and is easily underestimated by policymakers. Nonetheless, &#8220;Losing Control&#8221; has its weaknesses. Mr King caricatures globalisation&#8217;s proponents as pollyannas who see only winners and no losers from the integration of emerging economies. He gives short shrift to a wealth of well-known economic analysis&#8212;on everything from the determination of consumer prices to the causes of income inequality&#8212;which suggests that the impact of emerging economies is more nuanced than he allows. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> His conclusions are too glib. Mr King&#8217;s main proposal, sketched out in a few breezy pages, is the creation of three big monetary unions&#8212;an expanded euro zone along with currency unions in Asia and the Americas. It is hardly his fault that this book appears at a time when Greece&#8217;s financial crisis provides a glaring example of the risks in monetary union. But Mr King fails to make a convincing case for why such a reform would ever happen or why it would lead to a more stable global monetary system. &#8220;Losing Control&#8221; is more a series of provocative comments than a convincing argument. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Plundered Planet: Why We Must&#8212;and How We Can&#8212;Manage Nature for Global Prosperity. </strong>By Paul Collier. <em>Oxford University Press; 271 pages; $24.95.

    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS a common tactic of environmentalists, frustrated at the latest chemical spill or development disaster, to repeat the question: &#8220;What will our children think of us?&#8221; Paul Collier, a British developmental economist who made his name with &#8220;The Bottom Billion&#8221;, his 2007 study of the world&#8217;s poorest people, is at least prepared to take this overused question seriously. His latest book examines the issue of how best to use the oil, coal, diamonds, timber and minerals that modern industrial civilisation depends on, while ensuring that man&#8217;s present rapaciousness does not leave nothing for those who will come after us.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;The Plundered Planet&#8221; covers a great deal of ground for a relatively slim volume. Mr Collier looks at the vexed question of a resource &#8220;curse&#8221; (why is it, for instance, that oil has made Norway rich, but diamonds have ruined Sierra Leone?). He ponders the best way to distribute the revenue raised from resources that were bestowed upon some people by a mere whim of providence rather than any productive effort on man&#8217;s part, and explores how best to deal with resources that lie in nobody&#8217;s sphere of control (deep-sea fish, for instance, which obstinately refuse to confine themselves to national waters). And he ponders the &#8220;bads&#8221; as well as the &#8220;goods&#8221;: how are we to deal with global emissions of planet-heating gases?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For anyone already familiar with such questions, there is not a great deal here that is startlingly original. Mr Collier writes that, in exploiting resources, we should be careful to create more wealth than we destroy. Anything else is merely looting the future for the convenience of the present. Good governance&#8212;in particular democracy, transparency and a lack of corruption&#8212;and enforceable property rights are the best way to ensure that this is done. Even where there is no clear ownership of a resource, and the incentives to plunder it are strongest, some sort of political agreement between countries, he argues, is the only alternative to over-exploitation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Collier is an economist and it shows. His neat, geometrical analyses (that the wealth created by pumping oil must at least equal the notional value of the oil itself, for example) come straight from the greatly simplified facsimile of reality that professional economists inhabit. Mr Collier has been accused in the past of over-simplification. This book is vulnerable to similar criticism, yet it would be unfair. Simplification is not always a bad thing: ignoring the trees can reveal the shape of the wood. It is true that every country&#8217;s problems differ in their details, but that is not the same as saying that general principles should be discarded altogether. Anyone looking for a primer on how best to exploit the riches of nature could do worse than reading this introduction to the problem. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. </strong>By Rebecca Skloot. <em>Crown; 384 pages; $26. Macmillan; \xA318.99. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THIS moving book, which was published in America in February and is now coming out in Britain, intertwines two stories, one of a personal tragedy, the other of an epoch in modern medicine. Both start in 1951, with the death from cervical cancer of 31-year-old Henrietta Lacks, a poor black tobacco farmer living in rural Maryland. She was treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, pretty well by the standards of the day. But by the end her sufferings were horrible, her abdomen badly burnt by the radiation treatment, the pain from her multiplying tumours far beyond the reach of morphine. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Four of Lacks&#8217;s children stayed with their father after her death, to suffer neglect and worse. The fifth, damaged in utero by syphilis, died just four years after her mother in a &#8220;Hospital for the Negro Insane&#8221;. One son grew up to serve 15 years for murder; one daughter, Deborah, who became close to the author, died as the book was being finished. None of Lacks&#8217;s children travelled far, or succeeded in rising out of poverty.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And then there is the story of the other fruit of her womb. Though neither she nor her family knew it, when Lacks arrived at Johns Hopkins complaining of a knot in her insides, the doctors who treated her had been trying to grow cancer cells in vitro for some time. They wanted to watch as the cells divided and multiplied, to understand how they differed from ordinary cells and how the disease got its start. Sometimes cells would survive for a few days, but they always petered out eventually&#8212;until the arrival of Lacks. The cells from her tumour, in the words of the laboratory assistant who prepared them for culture, grew &#8220;like crabgrass&#8221;. Their descendants are growing still.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Scarcely a development in modern medicine does not owe something to HeLa, as the cell line has been labelled. The Salk polio vaccine was tested on the cells shortly after Lacks died. Since then researchers have infected them with herpes, measles, salmonella, tuberculosis and many other diseases too. They were sent up with early space flights to see how human cells coped with zero gravity and exposed to radiation to test the effects of nuclear weapons. According to one estimate, if all the HeLa cells ever cultured were laid end to end they would encircle the globe three times.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This book also takes in some of the darker episodes of 20th-century medicine. The first place to produce HeLa samples on an industrial scale was the Tuskegee Institute&#8212;where, at the same time, syphilitic black men were left untreated so doctors could observe the progress of the disease. Later, at Ohio State Penitentiary, doctors injected HeLa cells into prisoners without telling them what they were doing: some developed tumours as a result. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Lacks had been dead a quarter-century before her children found out that descendants of their mother&#8217;s cells still lived. They gave blood samples to researchers&#8212;but a cavalier approach to explaining things left them with the impression that they were being treated for hereditary cancer, rather than simply helping scientists to gain a better understanding of the world&#8217;s most important cell line. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Their mother&#8217;s identity was made public with no thought for her descendants&#8217; privacy; now much of their DNA profile is a matter of public record. Poor in a country without comprehensive health-care insurance, they struggle to pay for medicines her cells helped to develop. Difficult medical matters&#8212;such as the asymmetry in power and knowledge between doctor and patient, and issues of privacy, consent and access to treatment&#8212;take on a particularly bitter flavour in this tale. A poor woman who died as a charity case in a &#8220;coloured&#8221; ward&#8212;but whose legacy transformed medicine for us all.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Edge of the world</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A historical tale of a Dutchman and a Japanese midwife</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet. </strong>By David Mitchell. Sceptre; 469 pages; \xA318.99. <em>To be published in America by Random House in June; $26. </em>Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DAVID MITCHELL, a British novelist, has a reputation for courage and panache as a writer. A devoted post-modernist, who plays with structure as easily as words, his work has twice been shortlisted for the Man Booker prize. His best known book, &#8220;Cloud Atlas&#8221;, came within a whisker of winning the award in 2004, but the judges could not throw off the suspicion that it was just a bit too clever for its own good.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His new novel is structurally his most conventional; a linear narrative, it is the first book Mr Mitchell has written wholly in the third person. It opens with the story of a Japanese midwife, Orito Aibagawa, who in 1799 thwarts a senior adviser to the emperor to save the life of a newborn princeling and his concubine mother. Just six pages long, it is a virtuoso piece of writing, full of oddities and magical phrasing. But it also serves to confuse the reader.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The book&#8217;s main focus, it turns out, is not the Japanese midwife at all, but a priggish Dutchman, Jacob de Zoet, who has left behind a fianc\xE9e in Holland to make his fortune with the Dutch East India Company on an island off Nagasaki. Japan had deliberately isolated itself from the rest of the world by the 18th century, a state of affairs that affords Mr Mitchell endless literary opportunity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Catching sight of the magnificent Miss Aibagawa, de Zoet falls passionately in love. All too soon, though, the Dutchman falls foul of the Japanese. Miss Aibagawa&#8217;s father dies, leaving huge debts, and the midwife is sold into slavery at a mysterious shrine.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When the hero and heroine are separated, the book still has 300 pages to go. Mr Mitchell fills the gap with a number of clever, if somewhat disconnected set pieces. The result is uneasy. As so often happens with his writing, the reader is left feeling more seduced than satisfied. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Two books that distinguish between piety and fundamentalism</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Meccanomics: The March of the New Muslim Middle Class. </strong>By Vali Nasr. <em>Oneworld; 308 pages; \xA316.99. </em>Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Paradise Beneath Her Feet: How Women are Transforming the Middle East. </strong>By Isobel Coleman. <em>Random House; 352 pages; $26. </em>Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ISLAM looms large, sometimes terrifyingly so, in the West&#8217;s vision of the Middle East. Westerners are apprehensive as they see secular-minded democrats losing ground to Islamic fundamentalists. This anxiety, greatly sharpened by the attacks on America in 2001, the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; and all its consequences, has led to many seeing any public expression of Islam as a threat. Two new books by Vali Nasr, an Iranian-American academic, and Isobel Coleman, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, offer a welcome challenge to such fears. Neither author disregards the danger posed by extremists (underlined this week by the attempted car-bombing in New York). But they insist on a careful distinction between piety and fundamentalism, and present a nuanced view of Islam&#8217;s role in public life that is cautiously hopeful.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The battle against religious extremism, writes Mr Nasr, will be won by the rising Muslim middle class. Change will come about through free trade and integration into the global economy, not by sanctions or military action. The region will not turn away from Islam but remain piously conservative, probably misogynistic too. Secularism&#8217;s appeal has been tarnished by the region&#8217;s many autocratic regimes&#8212;and Middle Easterners have countless reasons to resent the West and its attempts to impose its own style of political reform. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>None of this precludes reform which comes in many guises. Dubai, he claims, demonstrated that temporal and spiritual riches can be enjoyed together. Turkey&#8217;s situation suggests that moderate Islamic parties can act as a bulwark against radicalism. There is, writes Mr Nasr, &#8220;little evidence that the growing conservatism of Muslim societies is a bar to fighting for freedom and prosperity.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The position of women in much of the Muslim world would prompt many to disagree. Cracking down on women&#8217;s rights has often been an easy way for governments, secular or not, to placate their more extreme allies or enemies. But many Middle Easterners, both men and women, chafe at attempts to introduce Western-style feminism. An activist in Afghanistan gently berates do-gooding foreigners: &#8220;When they come here and start teaching the women about their rights, the women often go home and criticise their husbands and their life just gets worse.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Ms Coleman makes the case for Islamic feminism. Far from oppressing women, Islam endows them with plenty of rights; the problem lies in implementing those rights. Riffat Hassan, a Pakistani-American, argues that though the Koran treats women with respect, centuries of patriarchy have turned them into chattels. She and other Islamic feminists believe that by fighting for women&#8217;s rights within Islam, using the very same texts and doctrines that have proved so oppressive, women may be able to push through reform without being told that they have been indoctrinated by Western infidels.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At the same time, for many Middle Eastern women, Islamic feminism is a tactical choice, a stepping stone to something better. Shirin Ebadi, Iran&#8217;s Nobel-prize-winning campaigner for human rights, concedes that she would rather that the fight for women&#8217;s rights did not involve interpreting musty religious texts. &#8220;But is there an alternative battlefield?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;Desperate wishing aside, I cannot see one.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bruised by its invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and concentrating on the threat of religious extremism, the West is often blind to the many forms of Islam practised in the Middle East. These two sensible books argue that rather than trying to impose its own ideas, the West should listen more carefully to voices from the region.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A rarely seen Picasso is revealed, and breaks all records</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THREE months after the world&#8217;s most expensive work of art was sold at auction in London the record has been broken again. This time by the sale, at Christie&#8217;s in New York, of a painting by Pablo Picasso that had not been seen in public for more than 50 years and had only ever been photographed in black-and-white.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Eight bidders, including a Russian and someone from Asia, drove the price up to $106.5m (including commission and taxes). &#8220;Nude, Green Leaves and Bust&#8221; (pictured) was the most important in a series of portraits Picasso completed in the spring of 1932 of his young mistress, Marie-Th\xE9r\xE8se Walter. The painter, then 50 years old, was enjoying an unusual spurt of creativity. A week later he painted &#8220;Jeune Fille Devant un Miroir&#8221;, which is now in New York&#8217;s Museum of Modern Art. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;Nude, Green Leaves and Bust&#8221; formed the centrepiece of a retrospective of Picasso&#8217;s work in Zurich the same year. The painting was then acquired in 1951 by a Los Angeles property developer, Sidney Brody, and his wife, and hung in their modernist home designed by A. Quincy Jones. It rested quietly there until Mrs Brody died last November. Twenty-six other works were sold with it, fetching a total of $224.2m, the biggest single-owner sale ever. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The bidder who bought the Picasso this week also paid $10.2m, another world record, for George Braque&#8217;s 1953 &#8220;La Treille&#8221;. A nice evening&#8217;s shopping.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

  :content: "\r\n <div class=\"clear toprow\"><span class=\"article-section\"></span></div>\r\n \r\n \r\n <h1>Fred Halliday</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Fred Halliday, demystifier of the Middle East, died on April 26th, aged 64</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 6th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A CRUSH of 500 listeners waited apprehensively as, ill and moving slowly, Fred Halliday came up to speak about Iran. The occasion, in February 2009, was the 30th anniversary of Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s takeover. The place was the London School of Economics, where for 24 years Mr Halliday was professor of international politics, concentrating on the Middle East. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet for close on 90 minutes he held his audience spellbound. He told them that social conflict, not religious fervour, had provoked the Iranian revolution; that conflict persisted, and the regime was not likely to crack. He spoke with learning, humour and passion. At the end, his audience rose to applaud as for a piano virtuoso. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> As an interpreter of the Middle East, Mr Halliday&#8217;s talents overflowed. He spoke Arabic and Persian, as well as French, German, Spanish and Russian. He knew the history and cultures of the countries he wrote about. More than anything, he knew people. His London students, once back home in Cairo, Baghdad or Tehran, rose to high positions in government and business. His contacts were a foreign correspondent&#8217;s envy, as well as a boon to the LSE&#8217;s fund-raisers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> His learning came not only from books but from bars and caf\xE9s. He travelled, listened and argued. He had a thesaurus of political jokes, collected over years, at the expense of Baathists, Islamists, nationalists, imperialists, Palestinians, Israelis, everyone. He could be superbly rude to peddlers of clich\xE9 and to plausible-sounding simplifiers. With a tilt of the head and an ironic smile he could give a friendly tease or a devastating &#8220;Come off it.&#8221; Students adored him. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Middle Eastern studies suffered, in his view, from three faults. One was &#8220;mappism&#8221;. Behind handy diplomatic counters marked on maps &#8220;Iran&#8221;, &#8220;Iraq&#8221; or &#8220;Saudi Arabia&#8221; he saw poorly understood societies that were complex and shifting. He had no patience, secondly, with efforts, particularly in the United States, to illuminate the region from the armchair with mathematical models and theorising (&#8220;all this meta-stuff&#8221;). He thought, thirdly, that the cold war had led everyone, Middle Easterners included, to exaggerate the influence of outsiders. The region&#8217;s problems, he insisted, lay in the region more than in Moscow, Washington or the colonial past. Such views are now commonplace. They were not when Mr Halliday began. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a world of doctrines and positions, he was impossible to box. A stickler for meanings, he liked to be called not internationalist, but cosmopolitan. His mother was an Irish Catholic, his father an English Methodist-Quaker. He grew up in Ireland close to the border with the north. He was schooled in that least national of faiths, Catholicism, and tempted by the priesthood for a while. But at Oxford University he was drawn to a different universal message, that of Karl Marx. Instead of taking a fellowship, he joined the <em>New Left Review.</em></p>\r\n\
    <h2>Explaining bin Laden</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He stayed until 1983. He marched against the Vietnam war, summered at a student work camp in Cuba and trekked with Dhofari guerrillas, who were fighting the British-trained soldiers of the Sultan of Oman. At another time, a brainy left-winger interested in foreign affairs might well have entered the Labour Party and become foreign secretary or secretary of defence. Mr Halliday chose a stonier path. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the early 1980s he began a winding journey away from the radical left. It was not a prodigal&#8217;s return to neoconservatism, from one simplicity to another. He looked for a less dogmatic politics that combined liberal values, respect for human rights and social equity. He hoped the space for such a social-democratic outlook existed in regions he knew best, beyond Europe and the United States. He was too shrewd to believe that it must exist. He was nevertheless withering with anyone who claimed that the persistence of autocratic and theocratic attitudes meant that it could not exist. As with God and Marx before, he thought of political values as universal. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> He also favoured outside intervention to rid people of oppressors. A Soviet-backed regime was preferable to the Taliban in Afghanistan, and he blamed the United States for creating a seedbed for Islamist terror there. &#8220;Bin Laden&#8221;, he said, &#8220;is the illegitimate child of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.&#8221; He was for removing Saddam Hussein, though he thought the occupiers recklessly ill prepared. To the enemies this earned him on the left, he retorted: &#8220;The future of humanity does not lie in the back streets of Fallujah.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Halliday published more than 20 books. Ranging wide, he was not always right or consistent. He probably underplayed the force of faith in politics. Yet he had a nose for looming trouble, as his choice of travel spots in the 1970s attests: Cyprus, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan. He grasped the social instabilities of the Middle East, and sensed that they would burst out in new ways once the cold war ended. Diplomats and politicians, including Tony Blair, were glad of his advice.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Looking for a tidy thread in Mr Halliday&#8217;s views may be mistaken. His achievement was to be a personal bridge. He introduced Westerners to Middle Easterners who were neither hostile nor exotic, but hoped for the same things and treasured the same values as they did. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>In 2009 sales of recorded music totalled $17 billion globally. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a music-industry association, overall sales were hit by the recession, falling by 7.2% from their 2008 level. But sales of music in the form of digital files for use on computers, mobile phones and MP3 players grew by 9.2% to exceed a quarter of total sales during 2009. Digital files accounted for more than half of revenue from music sales in South Korea, where a law punishes those who repeatedly download pirated music by cutting off their broadband connections. Americans spent $4.6 billion on music last year, the most in the world. More than two-fifths of this was spent on digital files.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "
