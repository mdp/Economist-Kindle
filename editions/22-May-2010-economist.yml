    <h2>Artificial life, the stuff of dreams and nightmares, has arrived</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TO CREATE life is the prerogative of gods. Deep in the human psyche, whatever the rational pleadings of physics and chemistry, there exists a sense that biology is different, is more than just the sum of atoms moving about and reacting with one another, is somehow infused with a divine spark, a vital essence. It may come as a shock, then, that mere mortals have now made artificial life. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Craig Venter and Hamilton Smith, the two American biologists who unravelled the first DNA sequence of a living organism (a bacterium) in 1995, have made a bacterium that has an artificial genome&#8212;creating a living creature with no ancestor (see ). Pedants may quibble that only the DNA of the new beast was actually manufactured in a laboratory; the researchers had to use the shell of an existing bug to get that DNA to do its stuff. Nevertheless, a Rubicon has been crossed. It is now possible to conceive of a world in which new bacteria (and eventually, new animals and plants) are designed on a computer and then grown to order.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That ability would prove mankind&#8217;s mastery over nature in a way more profound than even the detonation of the first atomic bomb. The bomb, however justified in the context of the second world war, was purely destructive. Biology is about nurturing and growth. Synthetic biology, as the technology that this and myriad less eye-catching advances are ushering in has been dubbed, promises much. In the short term it promises better drugs, less thirsty crops (see ), greener fuels and even a rejuvenated chemical industry. In the longer term who knows what marvels could be designed and grown?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the face of it, then, artificial life looks like a wonderful thing. Yet that is not how many will view the announcement. For them, a better word than &#8220;creation&#8221; is &#8220;tampering&#8221;. Have scientists got too big for their boots? Will their hubris bring Nemesis in due course? What horrors will come creeping out of the flask on the laboratory bench?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such questions are not misplaced&#8212;and should give pause even to those, including this newspaper, who normally embrace advances in science with enthusiasm. The new biological science does have the potential to do great harm, as well as good. &#8220;Predator&#8221; and &#8220;disease&#8221; are just as much part of the biological vocabulary as &#8220;nurturing&#8221; and &#8220;growth&#8221;. But for good or ill it is here. Creating life is no longer the prerogative of gods. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Children of a lesser god</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It will be a while, yet, before lifeforms are routinely designed on a laptop. But this will come. The past decade, since the completion of the Human Genome Project, has seen two related developments that make it almost inevitable. One is an extraordinary rise in the speed, and fall in the cost, of analysing the DNA sequences that encode the natural &#8220;software&#8221; of life. What once took years and cost millions now takes days and costs thousands. Databases are filling up with the genomes of everything from the tiniest virus to the tallest tree. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These genomes are the raw material for synthetic biology. First, they will provide an understanding of how biology works right down to the atomic level. That can then be modelled in human-designed software so that synthetic biologists will be able to assemble new constellations of genes with a reasonable presumption that they will work in a predictable way. Second, the genome databases are a warehouse that can be raided for whatever part a synthetic biologist requires. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The other development is faster and cheaper DNA synthesis. This has lagged a few years behind DNA analysis, but seems to be heading in the same direction. That means it will soon be possible for almost anybody to make DNA to order, and dabble in synthetic biology. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is good, up to a point. Innovation works best when it is a game that anyone can play. The more ideas there are, the better the chance some will prosper. Unfortunately and inevitably, some of those ideas will be malicious. And the problem with malicious biological inventions&#8212;unlike, say, guns and explosives&#8212;is that once released, they can breed by themselves.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Biology really is different</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Home Brew computing club launched Steve Jobs and Apple, but similar ventures produced a thousand computer viruses. What if a home-brew synthetic-biology club were accidentally to launch a real virus or bacterium? What if a terrorist were to do the same deliberately?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The risk of accidentally creating something bad is probably low. Most bacteria opt for an easy life breaking down organic material that is already dead. It doesn&#8217;t fight back. Living hosts do. Creating something bad deliberately, whether the creator is a teenage hacker, a terrorist or a rogue state, is a different matter. No one now knows how easy it would be to turbo-charge an existing human pathogen, or take one that infects another type of animal and assist its passage over the species barrier. We will soon find out, though.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is hard to know how to address this threat. The reflex, to restrict and ban, has worked (albeit far from perfectly) for more traditional sorts of biological weapons. Those, though, have been in the hands of states. The ubiquity of computer viruses shows what can happen when technology gets distributed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thoughtful observers of synthetic biology favour a different approach: openness. This avoids shutting out the good in a belated attempt to prevent the bad. Knowledge cannot be unlearned, so the best way to oppose the villains is to have lots of heroes on your side. Then, when a problem arises, an answer can be found quickly. If pathogens can be designed by laptop, vaccines can be, too. And, just as &#8220;open source&#8221; software lets white-hat computer nerds work against the black-hats, so open-source biology would encourage white-hat geneticists.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Regulation&#8212;and, especially, vigilance&#8212;will still be needed. Keeping an eye out for novel diseases is sensible even when such diseases are natural. Monitoring needs to be redoubled and co-ordinated. Then, whether natural or artificial, the full weight of synthetic biology can be brought to bear on the problem. Encourage the good to outwit the bad and, with luck, you keep Nemesis at bay.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>Thailand&#8217;s </strong>army brought an end to more than two months of protests in Bangkok. Dozens of people were killed and scores injured over several days as troops moved in to break up the red-shirt camps and capture their leaders. The government imposed a curfew in much of the country. Nearly 30 prominent buildings in Bangkok were set on fire by protesters. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>South Korea </strong>officially accused <strong>North Korea</strong> of having fired a torpedo to sink one of its warships in March, killing 46 sailors. Its evidence included a propeller with North Korean markings. North Korea said it would treat any sanction it might face because of the incident as an act of war. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Maoist &#8220;Naxalite&#8221; rebels in <strong>India </strong>bombed a passenger bus in Chhattisgarh, killing 35 people, including 11 police officers. Four soldiers were killed in a Naxalite bombing in West Bengal. The Maoists also called a two-day general strike that spanned parts of five states. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Taliban claimed credit for a complex assault on the NATO base at Bagram, one of the biggest in <strong>Afghanistan</strong>. Two days earlier in Kabul a suicide-bomber targeted an American convoy killing 18 people, including five American troops and one Canadian. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Malaysia&#8217;s </strong>governing coalition suffered a bitter defeat in a by-election in Sarawak state, when ethnic-Chinese voters swung en masse to support the opposition led by Anwar Ibrahim. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The Tehran two-step</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a deal negotiated by Turkey and Brazil, <strong>Iran</strong> agreed to send 1,200kg of its low-enriched uranium to Turkey in exchange for 120kg of uranium enriched to a higher level for use in a medical-research reactor. But many were unconvinced. Soon after, Hillary Clinton, America&#8217;s secretary of state, said she had secured the backing of China and Russia for a draft UN resolution extending sanctions on Iran. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In <strong>Iraq</strong>, the electoral commission upheld the result of the March parliamentary election after a partial recount, leaving intact the two-seat lead of Iyad Allawi over Nuri al-Maliki, the incumbent prime minister. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After a high-profile trial which provoked international condemnation, a court in <strong>Malawi</strong> convicted a gay couple of gross indecency. They could face up to 14 years in prison. Uganda&#8217;s parliament is considering a bill that would make homosexuality a capital offence. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>A coincidence?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The<strong> French government </strong>was accused of striking a secret deal with Iran to secure the release of a French national from captivity. Two days after the Iranian authorities had freed Clotilde Reiss, a French teacher whom they had accused of spying, a French court ordered the release of Vakili Rad, who in 1994 was convicted of murdering a former Iranian prime minister. The French said the cases were unrelated.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Greece</strong> received &#8364;20 billion ($25.4 billion) from the European Union and the IMF, the first tranche of its &#8364;110 billion bail-out package. The country was hit by another general strike. Separately, the deputy tourism minister resigned when it emerged that her pop-star husband owed more than &#8364;5m in taxes and fines. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tens of thousands of <strong>Romanians</strong> took to the streets to protest against their government&#8217;s austerity measures, which include plans to cut public-sector pay by a quarter and pensions by 15%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A report into <strong>NATO&#8217;s</strong> future called on the alliance to prepare for unconventional threats such as cyberwarfare. The report is a prelude to NATO&#8217;s revised &#8220;strategic concept&#8221;, which will be unveiled in November.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Preliminary findings from an investigation into the air crash that killed the <strong>Polish president</strong>, Lech Kaczynski, and 95 others in April found that some passengers had been in the plane&#8217;s cockpit 20 minutes before the disaster. There had been speculation that the pilot attempted to land in bad weather under instruction from the president; the investigation provided no direct evidence for this claim.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>A sawing achievement</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In what was billed as the biggest commercial forest-preservation agreement in history, environmental advocates and timber companies struck a deal to protect 72m hectares of forests in <strong>Canada</strong>. The pact will ban logging in parts of the area and limit it in others. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The UN appointed Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat, as its top official on <strong>climate change</strong>. Yvo de Boer resigned from the job after December&#8217;s climate-change talks in Copenhagen.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Jamaica&#8217;s</strong> government announced it would extradite Christopher &#8220;Dudus&#8221; Coke, an alleged gang leader, to the United States. He is wanted in America for drug-trafficking and gun running. Jamaica had previously refused for months to hand him over.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Diego Fern\xE1ndez de Cevallos, a former presidential candidate in Mexico, disappeared in a suspected <strong>kidnapping</strong>. His car was found abandoned with blood stains inside it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Felipe Calder\xF3n, <strong>Mexico&#8217;s</strong> president, travelled to Washington for a state visit. Standing beside Barack Obama, Mr Calder\xF3n roundly condemned a new Arizona law that cracks down on illegal immigrants. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Arlen&#8217;s not their darlin&#8217;</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A smattering of primary elections in America confirmed the anti-incumbency mood of voters. In Pennsylvania <strong>Arlen Specter</strong>, a senator who was first elected in 1980, lost his renomination bid. He had switched parties from the Republicans to the Democrats, providing Barack Obama with a (temporary) filibuster-proof Senate majority, but was defeated in the primary by a contender to his left. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In <strong>Arkansas</strong> Blanche Lincoln, a moderate Democratic senator, was forced into a run-off after failing to win a majority in her primary against a union-backed challenger.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Rand Paul scored a big win for the tea-party movement in the Republican Senate primary in <strong>Kentucky</strong> by trouncing the establishment-backed candidate. Mr Paul&#8217;s father is Ron Paul, who ran for president in 2008 and is a hero to libertarian conservatives. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Democrats breathed a sigh of relief after winning a special election for a congressional seat in <strong>Pennsylvania</strong> that had been held by the late John Murtha, a legendary wrester of pork from Washington for his district.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>Markets had another unsettled week amid continuing worries that officials in the <strong>euro area</strong> have failed to resolve the sovereign-debt crisis in the currency block. The European Central Bank&#8217;s announcement that it had made an initial purchase of &#8364;16.5 billion ($20.4 billion) in government bonds as part of a programme to soothe markets left investors underwhelmed. The euro traded at a four-year low against the dollar. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Germany also rattled the markets and its partners by introducing a unilateral ten-month ban on <strong>naked short-selling</strong> (when securities are sold that are not owned or borrowed, which is the practice in conventional short-selling). Naked short-selling in credit-default swaps is blamed by some for pushing up Greece&#8217;s debt-funding costs, although BaFin, Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, said in March that it had found &#8220;no evidence of massive speculation against Greek bonds&#8221;. The French finance minister warned that the German ban could reduce liquidity in euro-zone bond markets. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, finance ministers in the European Union gave their blessing to proposed regulations that would curtail the activities of <strong>hedge funds</strong> and private-equity firms. With 80% of the European industry based in London, George Osborne, the British chancellor, raised his concerns but backed off from harsher criticism of the new rules, which are enthusiastically supported by France and Germany. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>True to its word</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Dubai World</strong> reached an agreement with its principal creditors to restructure $23.5 billion of debt, and emphasised that it did not require additional government support. The state-owned conglomerate roiled markets last November when it requested a six-month standstill on debt repayments. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Chinese </strong>stockmarkets fell again on fears that the government might rein in the booming housing market and that the debt crisis in Europe could hurt exports. After a strong rebound in 2009, the Shanghai Composite index is Asia&#8217;s worst-performing stockmarket so far this year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>American senators added more amendments to a <strong>financial-regulation bill</strong> ahead of a vote. Additions included lower interchange fees for credit-card companies, a new system for awarding business to credit-rating agencies and exemptions for some small businesses from a new consumer-watchdog agency. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Hitting the red button</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After the &#8220;flash crash&#8221; of May 6th, in which stockmarkets plunged within a matter of minutes, America&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission put forward plans for new &#8220;circuit breakers&#8221; for <strong>automated-trading systems</strong> that would halt dealings in shares which experience price movements of 10% or more over a five-minute period. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Britain&#8217;s <strong>Prudential</strong> published the prospectus for a $21 billion rights issue to help pay for its takeover of the Asian life-insurance business of American International Group. Since announcing the deal in March, Prudential has sought to assure investors about the $35.5 billion price-tag, insisting the business will be very profitable. The share offering was priced at a heavy discount. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Executives at <strong>Facebook</strong> met to decide whether they should simplify the 170 privacy options on the social-networking website amid growing unease about the public availability of users&#8217; personal information. Separately, <strong>Google</strong> admitted that it had sometimes unintentionally collected web data from wireless networks during mapping for its Street View service. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>General Motors</strong> made its first quarterly profit in three years. The carmaker reported net income of $865m for the three months ending March; its North American operations made a pre-tax profit of $1.2 billion. The company, which left bankruptcy protection last July, hopes to turn an annual profit in 2010, something it hasn&#8217;t achieved since 2004. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The <strong>price of oil</strong> closed below $70 a barrel for the first time this year. Oil prices have tumbled by a fifth since the beginning of May, partly because of a build-up in oil inventories at a delivery point in Oklahoma. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>On Firma ground</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Terra Firma Capital Partners agreed to invest &#8220;additional sums&#8221; in <strong>EMI</strong>, avoiding a default on its debt to Citigroup that could have seen the bank seize control of the music group. Terra Firma bought EMI in 2007, but has since struggled with its investment and undertook a cash-raising exercise to avert the loan default. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An auction of 3G bandwidth for <strong>wireless services in India </strong>reaped 677 billion rupees ($15 billion) for the government, double what was expected. According to the telecom regulator, subscriptions for current wireless services reached 584m in March. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

Encourage the good to outwit the bad and, with luck, you keep Nemesis at bay.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Europe's three great delusions</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The continent&#8217;s leaders have still not grasped how much they need to do to save the euro</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT HAS been another turbulent week for the euro. Investors have pondered the &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) rescue plan devised by euro-zone finance ministers&#8212;and remain nervous (see ). The euro has fallen sharply. Fears that the rescue plan will not be implemented may grow. But the real worry is that the time the plan should buy may be wasted as a result of three delusions which have overtaken European leaders.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first is shoot-the-messenger syndrome. Too many European politicians lay all the blame on speculators, hedge funds, rating agencies and the rest for &#8220;unwarranted&#8221; attacks on the euro. Such thinking has informed Germany&#8217;s decision to ban &#8220;naked&#8221; short-selling of government bonds. The German regulator itself admits that this practice played little part in the Greek mess. The ban will apply only in Germany, whereas most short-selling happens in London. If it has any impact at all, it will merely make it harder to sell government bonds.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The decision in Brussels to push through tough rules on hedge funds and private equity reflects an equally gormless view that such firms caused the financial crisis (see ). Nobody can deny that financial regulation needs to be improved. But to attribute the woes of euro-zone government-bond markets solely to evil speculators is dangerously misguided. In fact, investors everywhere (not least at home) have woken up, belatedly, to the extreme fiscal vulnerability of some euro-zone countries&#8212;and are now forcing budget cuts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The second delusion might be termed excessive faith in shock-and-awe. Although the euro&#8217;s rescue plan took weeks to devise, &#8364;750 billion is an undeniably big number. The European Commission&#8217;s president, Jos\xE9 Manuel Barroso, claimed it showed the euro zone would do &#8220;whatever it takes&#8221; to defend itself. Even less troubled euro-zone countries like Italy are pushing new fiscal austerity. Yet for Greece, faith in shock-and-awe seems misplaced. Even if it does everything it has promised (and it may well not), Greece will end up with public debt over 150% of GDP and at best meagre growth prospects. In truth, Greece&#8217;s debt problem is one of insolvency, not illiquidity&#8212;and insolvency cannot be rectified by piling on more debt, however shocking and awesome the amount. Instead, euro-zone governments and regulators should start planning now for an orderly debt restructuring, including the imposition of losses (&#8220;haircuts&#8221;) on banks that hold Greek debt.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Burying Greek busts</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The third and most disturbing delusion is that deeper structural reform is not necessary; everything will be fine if only Greece and other euro-zone laggards cut their budget deficits. Several notorious fiscal reprobates are promising Angela Merkel that they will whip themselves into line. This is both masochistic and cowardly. On the one hand, sharply reducing demand in economies that are recovering only weakly from recession may cause much unnecessary pain. But an obsession with fiscal discipline may also be an excuse for politicians to run away from tackling Europe&#8217;s chronic imbalances and the loss of competitiveness in southern Europe.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Greece, Spain and Italy all made strenuous efforts to qualify for the euro. But once in, they relaxed and gave up the tiresome business of pushing through reforms to enhance competition, hold down labour costs and boost productivity. In fact their loss of monetary and exchange-rate flexibility makes these reforms more pressing&#8212;as the euro crisis has underlined. It also makes it imperative that Germany do more to boost domestic demand. How sad that most euro-zone governments still do not seem to get it; how pathetic that they cover their ignorance by blaming hedge-fund managers in London. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The battle of Bangkok</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>An all-out massacre in the capital has been avoided, but Thailand is not beyond the risk of civil war</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE best that can be said about this week&#8217;s bloody street battles in Bangkok is that they could have been so much bloodier. In the end, red-shirt protesters, after camping out in the Thai capital for more than two months, surrendered in the face of the overwhelming might of the Thai army (see ). Thanks to that last-ditch display of common sense and common humanity, the protests ended with dozens dead, not hundreds. That is still a catastrophe for a country that seemed to be rushing towards prosperity and pluralism.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indeed, the fact that the scale of the disaster has so far been contained should not deflect attention from the dangers ahead. With the stock exchange and several other treasure palaces of Thailand&#8217;s globalised elite in flames, unrest spreading outside the capital and a curfew in effect in much of the country, it is not scaremongering to worry that civil war may ensue.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government would pooh-pooh such a notion. It has all along played down the seriousness of the crisis, preferring to pin the blame on a few &#8220;terrorists&#8221;, a rent-a-mob&#8212;and, above all, on its supposed paymaster, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister toppled in a coup in 2006 who is now in exile. In one way, the yellow-shirted elite is right: Mr Thaksin probably did play a malign role, especially in helping scupper attempts at a negotiated end to the protests. At the very least, he did not call on his supporters, as he could have done, to go home to avoid bloodshed. But however self-seeking and power-hungry Mr Thaksin may be, the red-shirt movement now dwarfs his individual ambition. It has become a broad-based response to a broken political system.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That breakdown explains why the risks remain so high. The obvious solution to the crisis in the short term is for parliament to be dissolved and fresh elections held. But the evidence of four elections since 2001 is that a fair one would probably be won by parties loyal to Mr Thaksin. The royalist elite might not accept that. After all, they ousted him in 2006, and saw off subsequent governments led by his proxies through street protests, airport sieges, quirky court rulings and parliamentary horse-trading&#8212;any means, it seemed, other than the ballot. No wonder some of the red shirts, even after coming close to achieving their main demand, for an early election, seemed to give up on parliamentary democracy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>With so much blood spilled, they will now be even less inclined to trust the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva, the prime minister, to organise a free and fair vote, and to respect the outcome. An interim government of national unity is needed. Sadly, Mr Abhisit&#8217;s ministers have set their face against any foreign involvement in helping arrange such an administration. &#8220;Thailand is not a failed state,&#8221; they say. Better, as proof of that assertion, to accept outside intervention when it is necessary. An interim government should have a remit not just to arrange a new election, but to discuss amending the constitution adopted under military rule in 2007, and to consider the transition few Thais want to talk about: the royal succession.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>We&#8217;re not in 1992 any more</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As the stand-off and then the fighting in Bangkok dragged on, many recalled the last time the city endured a massacre, in 1992. Then, tensions were calmed when the king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, berated both the protest leader and the then military dictator on television. An interim government under a respected technocrat, enjoying the royal seal of approval, took over. This time any hopes that the king might work the same magic came to nought.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is of course unfair to criticise him for this. He is 82, has been in hospital and may simply not be up for active political intervention. But it is not unfair to criticise the monarchy and its advisers for having created a system where the king is so sorely needed. Thai officials argue that the king is above politics and an important guarantor of stability. One lesson of the latest tragedy is that he cannot be both these things, and in fact, the monarchy is no longer either. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The world's most valuable stuff</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Mostly because of farming, water is increasingly scarce. Managing it better could help</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PEOPLE kill each other over diamonds; countries go to war over oil. But the world&#8217;s most expensive commodities are worth nothing in the absence of water. Fresh water is essential for life, with no substitute. Although mostly unpriced, it is the most valuable stuff in the world.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nature has decreed that the supply of water is fixed. Meanwhile demand rises inexorably as the world&#8217;s population increases and enriches itself. Homes, factories and offices are sucking up ever more. But it is the planet&#8217;s growing need for food (and the water involved in producing crops and meat) that matters most. Farming accounts for 70% of withdrawals.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Our this week looks at the increasingly visible consequences of the rising demand for water. Few of the world&#8217;s great rivers that run through grain-growing areas now reach the sea all the year round or, if they do, they do so as a trickle. Less obvious, though even more serious, are the withdrawals from underground aquifers, which are hidden from sight but big enough to produce changes in the Earth&#8217;s gravitational field that can be monitored by NASA&#8217;s satellites in space. Water tables are now falling in many parts of the world, including America, India and China. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far the world has been spared a true water war, though the belligerency in Darfur comes close to being one, and competition for water can sometimes bring rivals together as well as drive them apart. But since over 60% of the world&#8217;s population lives in a river basin shared by two or more countries, the scope for squabbles is plain. Even if acute water shortages were to become widespread in just one country&#8212;India, say, or China&#8212;they could lead to mass migration and fighting.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although the supply of water cannot be increased, mankind can use what there is better&#8212;in four ways. One is through the improvement of storage and delivery, by creating underground reservoirs, replacing leaking pipes, lining earth-bottomed canals, irrigating plants at their roots with just the right amount of water, and so on. A second route focuses on making farming less thirsty&#8212;for instance by growing newly bred, perhaps genetically modified, crops that are drought-resistant or higher-yielding. A third way is to invest in technologies to take the salt out of sea water and thus increase supply of the fresh stuff. The fourth is of a different kind: unleash the market on water-users and let the price mechanism bring supply and demand into balance. And once water is properly priced, trade will encourage well-watered countries to make water-intensive goods, and arid ones to make those that are water-light. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Solutions on tap</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All four approaches have a part to play in the solution, but none is likely to end the over-drawing of water at all quickly. For instance, although crop yields may be improved by new technologies and even new breeds (especially following this week&#8217;s genome advance), no one has yet managed to produce plants that offer dramatically more crop per drop. Without such a breakthrough, growing more crops inevitably means losing more water, since each extra plant transpires water vapour into the atmosphere during photosynthesis. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Desalination looks more hopeful, since new technologies are being developed and prices are falling. But it is still expensive, especially in terms of energy use, which is why at present it provides only 0.4% of the world&#8217;s fresh water. It will undoubtedly add to the supply of drinking water, of the ultra-pure water required for some industrial processes, even of irrigation for high-value crops, especially if grown for export. But it won&#8217;t solve most farmers&#8217; water problems.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Liquid assets</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As for the market, when it approaches water it meets all sorts of obstacles: water is difficult to move, difficult to measure, difficult to price and often difficult to charge for, since many people think it should be free. Even in arid market economies where every drop is precious, the price of water seldom reflects scarcity. Trading in water rights may one day bring order to the 20m well-users in India, but not in time to feed the 1.4 billion Indian mouths expected by 2025.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If that is to be done, it will be done largely by managing demand. This is already beginning to happen in parts of both India and China, where farmers are learning how to measure the water they pump, how to use it to greatest effect and thus how to sustain aquifer levels. The urgent need now is to spread their principles and practices at home and to other countries. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even if the world manages to limit depletion, many water-related problems will persist. About 1 billion people are still without access to a decent water supply, while others suffer from flooding, pollution and poor sanitation. Yet if man wants to solve these problems, he can. He has applied far more money and know-how to issues far less important than the shortage of water. And if he does tackle them successfully, the big causes of human suffering&#8212;disease and poverty&#8212;will be automatically alleviated. Investing more thought and cash in the better use of the world&#8217;s most valuable commodity is surely worthwhile. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

  :title: Dicing with data

    <h1>Dicing with data</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Google and especially Facebook should change the way they look after people&#8217;s personal information</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN THE space of a week two of the best-known internet companies have found themselves in a pickle over privacy. Facebook faces criticism for making more information about its users available by default. Meanwhile Google has been castigated by a bevy of privacy regulators for inadvertently collecting data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in people&#8217;s homes as part of a project to capture images of streets around the world.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although the two cases are distinct, they have revived fears that online privacy is being trampled underfoot as internet behemoths race to grab as much data as possible. And they have provoked calls for tougher action by regulators and governments to prevent web firms from abusing the mountains of personal data they now hold. Danah Boyd, a social-networking expert, has even argued that Facebook, with its hordes of members around the world, is now so embedded in people&#8217;s lives that it should be regulated as a utility. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The firms have fought back. Facebook claims that most of its users are comfortable with the changes it has introduced, including one that lets it share detailed customer data with some external sites. It has blamed the furore on media hysteria; only a few privacy activists have publicly committed &#8220;Facebook suicide&#8221; by closing their accounts (see ). As for Google, it has apologised for its &#8220;mistake&#8221; and says that leaders of its Street View project knew nothing about the software that allowed its roving vehicles to capture snippets of e-mails.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Friends or foes?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At its most extreme, the attack on Facebook and Google makes little sense. Treating them as utilities seems excessive, for two reasons. They are not essential services that enjoy a local or national monopoly; people who feel their privacy is being violated are free to hop to other web services (remember AltaVista and MySpace?), though many sites deliberately make it hard for them to take their data with them. A second reason to tread carefully is that strict regulation could stifle the rapid innovation in business models that has thrived on the internet. Instead, officials should concentrate on enforcing existing privacy rules&#8212;something they seem reassuringly keen to do. Canada&#8217;s privacy commissioner, Jennifer Stoddart, has given warning that her organisation may take action against Facebook for violating a deal reached last year requiring the network to seek users&#8217; permission before sharing their data. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, even if, like this newspaper, you both distrust government intervention and believe the world has gained from the sharing of information on the web, there are plainly real grounds for concern. For instance, Google claims it discovered that its software had been accidentally recording private information for several years only after privacy officials in Germany demanded that it come clean about the data being collected. That is a stunning admission from a technology giant&#8212;and privacy watchdogs are right to investigate that. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Facebook&#8217;s problem is more fundamental. True, the social network has some of the most extensive privacy controls on the web, but these have now become so complex&#8212;and are tweaked so often&#8212;that even privacy experts find them bamboozling. The company also has a powerful incentive to push people into revealing more information. Facebook generates most of its revenue from targeted advertisements based on users&#8217; demography and interests, so the more data users share publicly the more money it can mint from ads. It may well be betting that users are now so hooked that they are unlikely to revolt against a gradual loosening of privacy safeguards. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The worst thing is Facebook&#8217;s underlying prejudice against privacy. Sign up and it assumes you want to share as much data as possible; if not, you have to change the settings, which can be a fiddly business. The presumption should be exactly the opposite: the default should be tight privacy controls, which users may then loosen if they choose. If Facebook fails to simplify and improve its privacy policy, it will justly risk the wrath of regulators&#8212;and many more Facebook suicides. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>On Montenegro, Indonesia, Canada, Arizona, Britain's electoral system, dams, rioting</h1>\r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Montenegro and corruption </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Your suggestion that the case of Darko Saric, a Serbian fugitive wanted on charges of drug-smuggling, has &#8220;hit the reputation of Montenegro&#8221; was way off the mark (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th). As you noted, preliminary evidence indicates that Mr Saric may have laundered money through the Montenegrin branch of Hypo Alpe Adria, an Austrian bank. Montenegro has begun an inquiry and will press charges where appropriate. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fact is, criminals launder money in countries all around the world. It is hard to understand why you think Montenegro&#8217;s reputation might be compromised, especially as the authorities are taking action to identify those responsible. Would you say that the Saric affair has damaged the standing of Austria, where Hypo Alpe Adria is based, or the United States, where some of Mr Saric&#8217;s funds supposedly originated? </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is no secret that Montenegro is battling corruption. The press often ignores the fact that we are winning that fight. The Council of Europe&#8217;s Group of States Against Corruption reported that Montenegro has satisfactorily implemented 67% of its recommendations since 2006, a greater percentage than that of any other Balkan nation. Freedom House gave Montenegro a better rating on corruption in 2009 compared with just two years prior. Transparency International accorded Montenegro a better score on corruption than any other Balkan country apart from Croatia. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Igor Luksic<br>Deputy prime minister<br>Podgorica, Montenegro </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The banned played on </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; According to your article on the efforts in Indonesia to tackle smoking, the anti-tobacco lobby tried to stop a Kelly Clarkson concert in Jakarta (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st). This is a misrepresentation of the position taken by tobacco-control groups. The Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance joined its Indonesian partners in objecting to the sponsorship of the concert by a tobacco company, and not to the event per se. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><em>The Economist</em> would know that tobacco-sponsored entertainment has been outlawed in many countries around the world, and hence should not ridicule efforts by those who want to do the same in Indonesia. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Canada&#8217;s economy </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; You appropriately recognised the benefits of Canada&#8217;s approach to regulating banks (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th). However, in the past, Stephen Harper, the prime minister, has been a vocal proponent of bank mergers and deregulation. Instead of stimulating the economy he at first celebrated the recession as a &#8220;buying opportunity&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Threatened by the opposition-dominated Parliament, economic stimulus was a deathbed conversion for him. His present opposition to proposed financial reforms, such as bank levies and tariffs on financial transactions, needs to be understood in the context of his previous enthusiasm for bank mergers and deregulation. Leaders of the G8 and G20 should look to Canada for best practices on banking regulations, but don&#8217;t take its prime minister&#8217;s advice on the economy. To be clear: Canada&#8217;s economy is stronger than that of other wealthy countries despite Mr Harper, not because of him. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Paul Dewar, MP<br>New Democrat spokesperson on foreign affairs<br>Ottawa</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; The only thing missing from your comparison of the fiscal situation in Canada and the United States was the recognition that Canadian provinces run operating deficits, whereas American states do not, because they cannot. If you added up Canada&#8217;s federal, provincial, municipal and crown-corporation debt, its debt-to-GDP ratio would be very close to America&#8217;s. What&#8217;s more, the Certified General Accountants of Canada issued a report recently indicating that Canada now has the dubious distinction of ranking first in terms of debt-to-financial assets ratio among 20 OECD countries. I think our bragging rights are gone. </p>\r\n\

    <p>Brent Kroeker<br>Winnipeg, Canada </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Passions on the border </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; I took exception to your leader about the new immigration law in Arizona, in which you repeated many of the incorrect generalisations popularised in the mainstream media (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th). For example, you said that Arizona&#8217;s state law &#8220;would require all non-US citizens to carry documents proving their immigration status&#8221;, but this is already federal law and the norm in most countries. Rather than looking closely at the act, its opponents choose to criticise it for their own political advantage. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Arizona&#8217;s law is not &#8220;deeply illiberal&#8221;, but reasonable and prudent. The legislation specifically prohibits race, colour and national origin as a basis for suspicion and arrest. Arizona faces many challenges regarding illegal immigration and this is a small tool that local police officers can use in their attempt to stem the tide of drugs and violence that are the result of America not having secure borders.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dean Riesen<br>Scottsdale, Arizona</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; Around 10% of the population of Mexico has entered the United States illegally. What if 10% of Russia entered Finland or 10% or China entered Siberia or 10% of Egypt entered Israel? The outcry would be deafening. What is needed on our border is the rule of law. Arizona is supplying it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>William Thayer<br>San Diego</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; The only thing Arizona&#8217;s law does is make it illegal for illegal immigrants to be in Arizona illegally.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Rogelio Saez de la Fuente<br>San Jose, California </p>\r\n\
    <h2>A bill of wrongs? </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; You got it wrong on Britain&#8217;s new politics (&#8220;&#8221;, May 15th). There is much that is positive in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, but its constitutional &#8220;innovation&#8221; is appalling. The idea that a government may fall only if 55% or more of members of Parliament vote against it is outrageous. Since at least 1688 the will of Parliament has been paramount; tinkering with that tradition is foolish and profoundly wrong. What happens if a government loses the confidence of Parliament but refuses to resign? No legislation could get passed, no fresh elections could be called. How would we get rid of the government? And where did the 55% threshold come from? Why not 53% or 60%? And why not apply it to motions other than those of &#8220;no confidence&#8221;?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A new politics is all very well but some conventions have stood the test of time. The job of conservatives is precisely to conserve worthwhile traditions, and a majority vote of 50% plus one is one of those. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Raphael Mokades<br>London</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Almost 33 years ago you published a series of essays on the inadequacies of Britain&#8217;s Parliament, in which you argued that the time was ripe for the return of Guy Fawkes (&#8220;&#8221;, November 5th 1977). The thesis was that Britain&#8217;s electoral system had led to an overpowerful executive that ruled the country only nominally through debate in Parliament, and actually by the ruthless whipping of subservient members through their parties&#8217; lobbies. Parliament wasn&#8217;t working.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At the heart of your argument lay the following assertion: &#8220;Only the blessed accident of a hung Parliament&#8230;at the next or some future election can lead to reforms of parliamentary practice, to greater accountability and to the constitutional checks on minority parliamentary rule that Britain now lacks. No government with a working majority in the British House of Commons is likely to legislate away its present absolute control.&#8221; How true that has proved.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now there is a real chance to make serious changes: to improve the voting system, to lessen the power of party hacks and to return an element of independence to individual MPs. It is time that British politics became less dramatic, less hyperactive and less media-conscious. If this happens, perhaps the Guy Fawkeses of the 21st century can put away their burning tapers, for a few decades at any rate.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\

    <h2>Africa's dams</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; Regarding your article on building dams in Africa (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th), the construction of the Aswan High Dam, and creation of Lake Nasser, was a formative event for UNESCO. For the first time, the international community galvanised to protect an archaeological heritage threatened by a large &#8220;development&#8221; project. Today, north-eastern Africa faces similar challenges.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As with the Egyptian case decades ago, the Merowe dam in Sudan and the dams in Ethiopia are likely to underperform in power generation. They will, with certainty, have a negative impact on rural communities and damage irreplaceable historical and archaeological sites (hitherto considered collateral damage). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At the very least, African governments and project-backers should vigorously enforce standards set by the World Commission on Dams for assessing human, environmental, and heritage impacts. It is unacceptable that Sudan and Ethiopia, which have so much yet to teach about African and world histories, engage in &#8220;development&#8221; projects in a manner that may leave Africans without a history to turn to.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Jonathan Walz<br>Gainesville, Florida</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Riot polis</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; I was intrigued by your statement that, &#8220;street riots, even violent ones&#8221; are a too-frequent part of Greek political life (&#8220;?&#8221;, May 8th). Presumably you think riots in more orderly countries are non-violent. </p>\r\n\

    <p>THE black smoke that had hung over Bangkok&#8217;s jagged skyline for six days grew thicker and more noxious. On May 19th combat troops marched into the protest camp where a few thousand anti-government red-shirt stragglers remained, defiant to the end. Their main leaders went quietly, to howls of disapproval from diehard demonstrators, but 13 people died and more than 80 were injured as the camp was cleared. Angry protesters torched their tyre-and-bamboo barricades, then set fire to the Bangkok stock exchange and Central World, one of South-East Asia&#8217;s biggest department stores.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The dawn assault on the fortified camp was methodical, and met only scattered resistance from gunmen holed up inside. It was not, mercifully, the Tiananmen Square rerun that some had predicted. Most protesters took shelter in a temple, and then were herded away to evacuation points. Security forces had overwhelming force on their side. On the outskirts of the camp, though, riots flared along a main road that had seen the worst of the recent fighting. Arson attacks spread to new areas, and gun battles erupted in the blackened underpass beneath an expressway, not far from a port slum that has begun staging its own red-shirt rally. Protesters in the north and north-east, where red-shirt sympathies run deepest, were quick to resort to arson attacks in retaliation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> All this has its roots in a military coup in 2006, when the then prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecoms tycoon, was removed from power. He fled into exile, but the red shirts continue to support him, and have been demanding new elections. They present themselves as rural and poor, as opposed to the urban elites who are closer to the revered King Bhumibol and his family. The protests have been their way of venting their political frustration. They have also revealed the deep social and economic divisions in Thai society. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, has failed to make any headway with the red shirts. On April 10th he hastily sent in troops to clear another protest site, with the loss of 25 lives. But he does deserve credit for offering a compromise since then. On May 3rd he proposed the holding of elections in November, a year before his term ends, as part of a reconciliation package. That the leaders of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), the red shirts&#8217; formal title, failed to grasp this olive branch is tragic. They, as much as trigger-happy soldiers, must bear some responsibility for the lives lost. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Yet even on May 18th an 11th-hour ceasefire had appeared close. But mistrust on both sides proved impossible to bridge, and the talks failed. In truth, this approach may have been doomed since widespread fighting erupted on May 13th after a presumed army sniper picked off General Khattiya Sawasdipol, a rogue officer who ran the red shirts&#8217; security. He died on May 17th. Suspended from duty but not yet stripped of his rank, he was honoured with a funeral sponsored by the king at a Buddhist temple, another reminder of how much rank means in Thailand. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>By then, the die had been cast. Military units trying to block off the sprawling protest site were attacked by stone-throwing yobs who brought along petrol bombs and firecrackers. Shadowy black-clad militia-members also joined in, though fleetingly. Soldiers shot back without much restraint, even at paramedics trying to bring out the wounded. Road junctions were declared &#8220;live-fire zones&#8221;. The mayhem spread to other parts of the city. The military cordon appeared to be breaking as red shirts defied orders to stay away. Something had to give. In the end it was overwhelming military force, not a political deal among the warring factions, that won the day. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As the bullets flew and the bodies fell, crocodile tears came from afar, as Mr Thaksin tweeted his sorrow to his followers. From his luxurious exile he denied, once again, that he was giving orders to the red-shirt leaders and urged everyone to embrace peace. There is little doubt, however, that Mr Thaksin holds sway over the splintered, squabbling red-shirt leadership. The two-month protest would not have been possible without his deep pockets, vengeful will and political network, even though the red-shirt cause has become much larger than him. And his stubbornness seems to have undone the peace talks, despite his protestations. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Society fractured</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In April 2009, when troops were also called in to restore order in Bangkok, red-shirt leaders got carried away by their own rhetoric and found themselves quickly out on a limb. Veera Musikapong, a moderate Thaksin follower, recommended surrender instead. Tellingly, he left the red-shirt camp last week when it became clear that hardliners led by Mr Thaksin would not accept Mr Abhisit&#8217;s peace plan. Mr Veera&#8217;s behind-the-scenes efforts to bring the leadership back into the fold came to nothing. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Thailand&#8217;s crisis continues to unfold, many will wonder how it came to this. If politics is the art of the compromise, Thais had appeared to be experts. Various political factions, both elected and unelected, cobbled together governments that oversaw steady economic growth even as they squabbled and scrapped for the spoils. That pragmatic formula no longer works. Political crises have polarised opinions within families, workplaces and communities, and hollowed out the centre. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is why this crisis goes much deeper than previous rounds of political violence, including the bloodshed in May 1992 when a coup leader sent troops out to mow down pro-democracy protesters. Then, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was able to order a truce between the army chief and the protest leader, and appoint an interim administration to steer the country out of crisis. Bhumibol, who is 82 and confined to hospital, has stayed out of the current mess. Some red shirts, and many foreign observers, believe that the palace has already taken sides and is no longer an honest broker. The 2006 coup and royalist yellow-shirt protests in 2008 drove home that message. But even if Bhumibol did try to mediate this time, there is no simple fix. The prospect of the looming succession, with an unpopular crown prince in the wings, further heightens tensions.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Why compromise failed</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The aftermath of the May 19th crackdown will probably see sporadic unrest, both around Bangkok&#8217;s slums and in the north and north-east. Many of the red shirts at the rally came from the north-east, which accounts for around one-third of parliamentary seats. Since 2001 the region has overwhelmingly voted for Mr Thaksin and his allies. The red shirts had sought to force a new election in the belief that voters would turf out Mr Abhisit, the darling of Bangkok&#8217;s privileged classes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Had the red shirts accepted the prime minister&#8217;s offer of elections, the timetable would have been to their advantage. Now an election seems like a liability in a climate of violence and fear. It is hard to imagine government candidates setting foot in the red-shirt heartland without a phalanx of armed guards. Many in Bangkok would be irate to see the protest leaders run for office. Mr Abhisit has argued that an election, in itself, will not solve Thailand&#8217;s political problems. He has a (self-serving) point. A chaotic, disputed ballot, and the absence of neutral bodies to settle disputes, could drag Thailand further down the road towards civil war, which is increasingly talked about. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Many are asking why peace talks failed, when the red shirts had little hope of resisting the troops. Insiders say that Mr Thaksin was a serious spoiler, as were General Khattiya and other radicals. In a dysfunctional and factionalised movement, internal talks bogged down. Some leaders balked at facing criminal charges without the guarantee of bail. But the leadership was also held hostage, in part, by its own rhetoric and the emotions stirred among its followers. Many were enraged by the April 10th slaughter and unimpressed by the six-month timeline for elections. &#8220;The mob would not allow them to give in so easily,&#8221; says a senior security official. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some red shirts complain that the prime minister&#8217;s plan was too vague and lacked teeth. They did not trust Mr Abhisit to keep his promises, and asked what would happen if he resigned or his party were dissolved for electoral irregularities (it faces a court case). But by far the greatest distrust, and the hardest to overcome, is that felt by a sizeable number of Thais, inside and outside the red shirts, towards the country&#8217;s royalist elite and its political, military and business allies. This grouping blithely tossed out Mr Thaksin when he got too big for his boots. That he was thuggish and greedy was a handy excuse. But the 2006 coup failed to bury him politically and only unleashed a wider backlash against an elite that still believes in a divine hierarchy of which they are the agents. Mr Abhisit would object to such a description, but his class betrays little sympathy or interest in the aspirations of rural and working-class voters. Their attitude, says Supavud Saicheua, an economist at Phatra Securities, is: &#8220;We are brilliant people. We know what you want.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such intransigence has bred dark, violent dreams. Most red shirts swear blind that they stick to peaceful methods, even if they have to resort to disruptive sit-ins. Indeed, the protests were surprisingly jolly and gentle at the start, to the relief of Bangkokians who remembered the April 2009 unrest. Their message of social and economic injustice, and of the double standards in Thai justice, got a sympathetic hearing. It seemed that the tide had shifted towards the red shirts and away from their yellow-shirted rivals in the People&#8217;s Alliance for Democracy (PAD). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But it has long been apparent that some red followers do not believe in gradual change in Thailand&#8217;s political order. Simply put, they think it is not possible to play at democracy in the current circumstances. To this group of rogue military types, armchair revolutionaries and opportunists, the endgame is not elections, but regime change. The current violence is only the start of a long revolutionary road. This is the unfinished business of 1932, when the absolute monarchy ended and Thailand&#8217;s power balance began to shift towards other forces. It is still in flux, and is likely to remain so as long as the post-Bhumibol future is so uncertain. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Conservatives will object vehemently to this characterisation of Thailand&#8217;s troubled politics. They will argue that Mr Thaksin has hoodwinked the world into believing that his red-shirt rabble is poor and oppressed. Not so, they say. Thailand&#8217;s economic growth has trickled down to the masses, all under the benevolent gaze of Bhumibol. In recent weeks the foreign minister, Kasit Piromya, has railed at foreign diplomats who talked to the red shirts after the April 10th clashes, which the government says militant gunmen fomented. He snubbed a senior American diplomat who dared to sit down to breakfast with moderate opposition figures. He says foreign allies should be doing more to catch Mr Thaksin, a &#8220;terrorist&#8221;, as he calls him.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When the UDD called for the United Nations to step into the crisis, Mr Kasit retorted that Thailand was &#8220;not a failed state&#8221;. That is true. But if it does become ungovernable, the fault will not be Mr Thaksin&#8217;s alone. Equally culpable is the royalist PAD that Mr Kasit belongs to. He and many of his peers could not stand the idea of an elected government loyal to Mr Thaksin. So they helped organise a six-month protest in 2008 that culminated in the seizure of Bangkok&#8217;s two airports, all in the name of defending the monarchy. Two prime ministers were removed by the courts on dubious grounds. The stage was set for Mr Abhisit to take power, enraging those who voted in his opponents and laying out the template for mob rule which the red shirts have copied. No PAD leader has gone on trial for what he did. The red leaders may be less fortunate. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Sorting out this mess would require an end to the &#8220;crooked procedures&#8221; that began with the 2006 coup, says Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. That means constitutional reforms to undo the undemocratic rules imposed by the army. It may also be helpful to lift bans on politicians from dissolved pro-Thaksin parties, some of whom are far more moderate than those in the UDD and not necessarily on Mr Thaksin&#8217;s side. All of this was under discussion a year ago, after Bangkok&#8217;s last conflagration. That Mr Abhisit failed to make these changes and frame his mission as peaceful reconciliation is lamentable. It will only be harder now. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Why Republicans should worry</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A good week for tea-partiers, bad for turncoats and incumbents, better than it might have been for the Democrats</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR months now the Democrats have braced for a drubbing in November&#8217;s forthcoming mid-term elections for Congress. With the economy in the doldrums and Barack Obama&#8217;s approval ratings languishing in the high 40s, big Republican gains have looked inevitable&#8212;big enough, perhaps, to wrest control of the House of Representatives from the Democrats. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After a week of elections across the country, that still remains the case. But none of the results from this week&#8217;s &#8220;Super Tuesday&#8221;&#8212;on May 18th internal party primaries took place in Arkansas, Kentucky, Oregon and Pennsylvania, and a special election was held in western Pennsylvania&#8212;has made the outlook for the Democrats much bleaker than it did before. If anything, they have grounds for at least some cheer. It is the Republicans who must now face up to a potential problem.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is true that the most famous scalp to fall on Tuesday night was that of Senator Arlen Specter, who has spent 30 years in the Senate (see ). For a brief period Mr Specter gave Mr Obama his supermajority in the upper chamber. He also cast the deciding vote on last year&#8217;s stimulus bill. But his defeat by Joe Sestak in Pennsylvania&#8217;s Democratic primary cannot be construed as a defeat for the party itself. After all, Mr Specter&#8217;s chief handicap was that he was a Republican until crossing the aisle just over a year ago. The Democrats&#8217; national leadership tried to save him. But since turncoats are unpopular, it is by no means certain that Mr Sestak, an impressive congressman and former naval officer, will fare worse against the Republican Patrick Toomey in November. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Democrats can meanwhile draw encouragement from the only fight on Tuesday that took place between parties rather than within them. Their man won the special election to fill the House seat left vacant in Pennsylvania&#8217;s 12th congressional district by the death in February of John Murtha, a long-serving Democrat. Having worked for Mr Murtha, Tuesday&#8217;s victor, Mark Critz, held out the promise of continuing his boss&#8217;s legendary knack of delivering Washington pork to the Pennsylvania rustbelt. The Republicans had sought to counter Mr Critz by turning the race into a referendum on the Obama administration. At times during the campaign the polls suggested they were close to success. In the end, however, Mr Critz beat the Republicans&#8217; Tim Burns, a self-made local millionaire, by a respectable margin of 53% to 45%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A defeat there would have been wretched for the Democrats. White working-class districts such as Pennsylvania&#8217;s 12th no longer account for more than about a quarter of the party&#8217;s seats in Congress. But holding on to them is essential if the party is to remain in power. Otherwise, says Bill Galston, a former party strategist and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, DC, &#8220;the Sisyphean task of constructing a Democratic majority will come to its Sisyphean end&#8212;with the rock rolling back down the hill.&#8221; But whether Mr Critz&#8217;s success can be repeated in his own or similar districts in November remains an open question. It is telling that he had to be careful in his campaign to distance himself from Mr Obama, disavow the &#8220;liberal&#8221; label and insist that if he had been in Congress at the time he would have opposed health reform, the president&#8217;s foremost domestic initiative. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Arkansas the primaries brought less comfort to the Democrats&#8217; national leadership. In a three-way race Blanche Lincoln, a Democratic centrist and sitting senator, failed to collect enough votes to avoid having to confront her main challenger, the state&#8217;s lieutenant-governor, Bill Halter, in a run-off next month. Senator Lincoln had antagonised the unions by wavering on health reform and opposing the Employee Free Choice Act, a bill that would help workers to unionise firms without a secret ballot. Her reputation as a Washington insider told against her at a time when Congress and the federal government are highly unpopular. But there are many parts of the country in which the Democrats will need to be able to run centrists like her if they are to do well in November.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is the Republicans, however, who may worry most about the price they could pay in November for internal ideological splits. In Kentucky the retirement of the junior senator, Jim Bunning, produced a humdinger of a fight between the party establishment in the person of Trey Grayson, Kentucky&#8217;s secretary of state, and Rand Paul, an outsider and ophthalmologist with little previous experience in politics. Mr Grayson was handpicked for Mr Bunning&#8217;s seat by the state&#8217;s senior senator, Mitch McConnell, who happens also to be the Republican leader in the Senate. All Dr Paul had going for him was a famous father (the Texas libertarian, Ron Paul, who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and may do so again) and the support of the tea-party movement that has electrified Republican politics this year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That proved more than enough. Being an outsider did not stop Dr Paul from routing Mr Grayson by 23 points. And this was only the latest of a string of successes for candidates supported by the tea-partiers. Earlier this month, in another stunning upset, Republicans in Utah dumped Bob Bennett, a three-term sitting senator whose solid conservative credentials were apparently no longer good enough to satisfy the party&#8217;s local activists. And in Florida in April opposition from the tea-partiers prompted the Republican governor, Charlie Crist, to quit the party altogether. He now intends to run for the Senate in November as an independent. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The impact of the tea-partiers is a decidedly mixed blessing for the Republicans. On the one hand, the party benefits from the passion and dollars this widespread grassroots mutiny against big government is able to inject into local campaigns. On the other, they are in danger of pushing the Republicans well to the right of the mainstream. Dr Paul, like his father, is a genuine radical who believes in paring government down to the bone. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;The tea party is huge,&#8221; Dr Paul declared in his victory speech. It will certainly have a huge influence on the tactics of Republicans thinking of running for the party&#8217;s presidential nomination. But since only registered Republicans were allowed to vote in Kentucky&#8217;s closed primary, it is difficult to know how many other voters, even in Kentucky, will plump for a candidate who threatens to slash their entitlements and hankers after the gold standard.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>With six months to go until the mid-terms, and with politics haunted by a powerful mood of anti-incumbency, plenty of political surprises no doubt remain in store. This week alone brought the resignation of Mark Souder, a Republican congressman from Indiana who had an affair with a staffer with whom he had recorded an appeal for sexual abstinence. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senatorial candidate for Connecticut, is in trouble for having conveyed the impression (unwittingly, says he) that he served in Vietnam, when in fact he had obtained several deferments. Such misdemeanours will do nothing to change the low opinion Americans have of their present lot of politicians. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | LOS ANGELES | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>COMPARISONS between California and the land of Socrates have become frequent recently. They are different, of course. California is nowhere near defaulting on its debts (though rating agencies consider that risk greater in California than in the other 49 states). But California has become America&#8217;s symbol of fiscal mismanagement as Greece is now Europe&#8217;s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, California&#8217;s lame-duck governor, conceded as much on May 14th, when he updated his budget proposal to the legislature. After several rounds of painful spending cuts, California is now contemplating a budget that is, when adjusted for inflation and population growth, smaller than it was a decade ago. And yet the state still confronts a budget hole estimated at $17.9 billion in the current and coming fiscal years. Mr Schwarzenegger, a Republican in a high-tax state, wants to plug that hole without raising taxes, with more cuts and some federal aid.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The governor admits that California has already plucked the &#8220;low-hanging fruits&#8221;, and the medium and high-hanging ones as well, and must now &#8220;shake the whole tree&#8221;. So he proposes not just trimming but eliminating state programmes wholesale. Gone will be the state&#8217;s welfare-to-work programme of services and cash assistance to poor families with children, which could affect more than 1m families. Its loss, if the legislature allows it, would make California the only state not to offer such a programme. Gone, too, will be most state-subsidised child care, which would affect more than 200,000 children. The list goes on.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Mr Schwarzenegger and the Democrat-controlled legislature began their haggling he made it clear that he wants, in his final year in office, to make one more attempt at fundamental reform. California has a volatile and outdated tax system that relies heavily on taxing income, especially capital gains. So Mr Schwarzenegger wants legislators to dust off an alternative system proposed by a bipartisan commission last year. It would introduce a new form of value-added tax while dramatically simplifying income taxes and scrapping corporate and sales taxes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He inveighs with even more passion against the over-generous pensions of state employees, costing them at more than $6 billion this year, about the same as the programmes he is being forced to eliminate. The state&#8217;s largest pension fund immediately contested those numbers. But Californians are increasingly rebelling against the largesse distributed by Mr Schwarzenegger&#8217;s predecessor, Gray Davis, a Democrat, who wooed unions 11 years ago with juicy benefits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Those pension deals, moreover, illustrate California&#8217;s more general problem: an asymmetry which guarantees that spending will always outpace revenues in the long term. It took a simple majority vote to increase public pensions, but it would take a two-thirds supermajority to raise taxes to pay for them. More recently, it took a simple majority to cut corporate taxes, but a supermajority would be needed to reverse that cut, and the minority Republicans will never allow that. Good at spending, bad at taxing, California is indeed not unlike Greece. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A second opinion</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Efforts to challenge Obamacare are gaining momentum</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>JOHN BARRASSO, the junior senator from Wyoming, is one of millions of Americans who think that Barack Obama&#8217;s health-insurance laws must be overturned. Two months after those reforms squeaked through Congress, polls suggest that many Americans still dislike them. Seizing on that unhappiness, the Republican Party is now boldly attempting to unravel Obamacare altogether.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> At the federal level Republican leaders in Congress have jumped on every bit of negative news&#8212;for example, a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office suggesting that the reforms will cost more than originally forecast&#8212;as just cause for overturning them. Dr Barrasso, an orthopaedic surgeon by training, calls this the &#8220;second-opinion&#8221; strategy. His party has even set up a second-opinion to gather all the anti-reform developments in one place.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The real action is outside Washington, though. Virginia, Utah and Idaho have outlawed the new individual mandate, which will require everyone to purchase health cover, and other states are looking at similar measures. Elsewhere, opponents have taken to the ballot box. Missouri will hold a referendum in August on the matter. Perhaps half a dozen other states may see a constitutional amendment blocking Obamacare on the ballot in November.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Critics have also filed various lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of health reform. In the most prominent nearly two dozen states, almost all led by Republicans, have banded together. Their chief legal argument is that the new individual mandate is unconstitutional. On May 14th the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group representing small companies (who worry especially about the costs of compliance with the new law), declared that it too would join in.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The Obama administration is unbowed. Its strongest counter-argument is that the mandate involves interstate commerce, which legal precedent places squarely in the hands of federal regulators. On May 12th its lawyers responded to a legal challenge in Michigan thus: &#8220;Individual decisions to forgo insurance coverage, in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce by shifting costs to health-care providers and the public.&#8221; The Department of Justice is due to respond to the legal challenge in Virginia by May 24th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> What will come of these challenges? Many constitutional experts think they will fail in the end. Even Clint Bolick of the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think-tank co-ordinating many of these legal attacks, has admitted that this assault on Obamacare &#8220;faces very tough odds&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Even so, Republicans are likely to press ahead. These multiple legal challenges give them a useful stick with which to bash the Democrats in the run-up to November&#8217;s vote; and their strategy is likely to keep the administration tied up in knots for years, even complicating the health law&#8217;s eventual rollout in 2014.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> If you doubt it, consider the comments made at a congressional hearing in April. A legal authority usually known for his caution declared that these controversial lawsuits would probably end up in the Supreme Court one day. That figure was none other than Stephen Breyer, a justice of that court. Unsurprisingly, the Republicans present did not ask for a second opinion. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Want to talk politics with your neighbour? Better ask permission</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | SEATTLE | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PAT MURAKAMI runs a small computer repair shop and does a little political agitating on the side. She worries about her neighbourhood, a vibrant area full of Vietnamese shops and veiled women waiting at bus stops. The city of Seattle tried to declare parts of it &#8220;blighted&#8221;, which would have enabled it to seize people&#8217;s homes and hand the land to private developers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mrs Murakami started a group called &#8220;Many Cultures, One Message&#8221;, to rally her neighbours in protest. She prevailed. Or at least, the plan to knock down chunks of her neighbourhood was shelved in 2007. But she worries that the politicians and their developer chums may try again, so she wants to reform Washington state&#8217;s rules on &#8220;eminent domain&#8221;, which give local government extraordinary powers to condemn private property. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>She ran into a second little-known state law. If she prints some flyers, calls some meetings and urges her neighbours to write to their state representative demanding change, she has to register as a &#8220;grassroots lobbyist&#8221;. This rule applies to any group that spends more than $500 in any given month trying to influence the legislature. That sum includes not only cash but also anything else of value.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To comply with the law, Mrs Murakami must provide details such as the name, address and occupation of everyone who helps organise her campaign or who contributes more than $25 in cash or kind to it. All this information is then made public on the internet. She must also provide monthly reports on all the group&#8217;s activities and expenditures. Failure to follow the rules can result in ruinous fines; $10,000 per violation, which could mean every time she sends out a mailshot. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mrs Murakami is suing to have this law overturned. If the first amendment means anything, she reckons, it surely protects the right of Americans to talk politics with their neighbours. Many of Mrs Murakami&#8217;s supporters are recent refugees from autocratic regimes. If getting involved means having their personal details published, they would rather not. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The same worry afflicts supporters of unpopular causes. Alfred Petermann, who runs a discussion group called &#8220;Conservative Enthusiasts&#8221;, says it is &#8220;unbelievable&#8221; that he has to publish the name, address and occupation of anyone who brings $25-worth of beer to a meeting. &#8220;Conservative&#8221; is a dirty word in Seattle, he says. Some in his group fear repercussions at work if they are outed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All states regulate professional lobbyists: ie, paid agents who communicate directly with politicians in the hope of swaying them. Fair enough. But a new report from the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group, reveals that 36 states also impose restrictions on &#8220;grassroots lobbying&#8221;, meaning people like Mrs Murakami. The rules are often complex and unclear. The first sentence of the Massachusetts guidelines for grassroots lobbyists is but a whisker shorter than the Gettysburg address and comprehensible only to a lawyer. Small groups cannot afford lawyers. Yet a few states even threaten criminal penalties for breaking the rules. In Alabama, the maximum sentence is 20 years in jail. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most severe punishments are seldom, if ever, applied. But they still have a chilling effect on the exercise of free speech. The constitution says people have a right &#8220;peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances&#8221;. Politicians hate that. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>It tolls for thee</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Flexibility on highway funding would make all the difference</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SINCE his first days as a presidential candidate, Barack Obama has championed investment in infrastructure. Now would seem a good time to do some. America has high unemployment and an unbalanced economy. Meanwhile, the downsides of oil dependence are painfully clear in the slick that is growing in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Obama&#8217;s stimulus programme included nearly $30 billion for road- and bridge-building and an $8 billion commitment to high-speed rail. But little has been done. A complete high-speed rail network would cost the federal government far more than the amounts currently on the table, and the White House has no national rail plan. The new national infrastructure bank has had its proposed budget slashed from $60 billion to $4 billion. Most disappointing, there has been no replacement for the transport-funding law that expired in 2009. Instead, the White House has pushed Congress to extend current funding until the end of 2010. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The building and repairing of roads in America is paid for by a federal petrol tax, which replenishes the highway trust fund. Current transport revenues are too puny to cover existing commitments, to say nothing of new initiatives. Only congressional infusions of money from general revenues have prevented the trust fund from going into the red (see chart). Because people are driving less, and cars are more efficient, the petrol tax is not the money-spinner it used to be. But uncertainty, fears about climate change and environmental disasters have not improved the appetite for a rise in the tax rate. It has stayed at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. Mr Obama ruled out a petrol-tax increase almost from the beginning of his presidency, saying it would threaten recovery. The administration recently opposed a carbon fee on fuels in a draft Senate climate bill for similar reasons.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>State governments, facing budget disaster, have mined other revenue sources, including tolls. Several states are financing new roads by introducing &#8220;high-occupancy toll&#8221; or HOT lanes, which carpoolers may use for nothing. But HOT lanes are typically built alongside normal lanes. Increasingly, state and local governments want to toll existing lanes, both to limit congestion and to raise funds that could be applied to all aspects of transport budgets. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Pennsylvania has attempted to toll Interstate 80, a highway running east to west across the centre of the state, in order to close a transport-budget gap of nearly $500m. But the Federal Highway Administration rejected this proposal in April, citing a federal rule that toll revenue generated on interstates may be used only to improve or maintain the road with the toll. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Since government money is so fungible, the distinction is an odd one. In early May the governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell, announced his intention to place a toll on Interstate 95 at the Virginia-North Carolina border. Although Mr McDonnell declared that the revenue would be used to improve I-95, his secretary of transport noted that if the request were approved, &#8220;that will free up the money that we are currently spending on 95 for maintenance and operation on other interstates.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tolling is economically efficient: it prices an overused resource (crowded roads). Apart from cutting congestion and raising money, tolls reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants. But Mr Obama has shown no interest in pushing for a change in the interstate tolling rule. Instead, legislators have scrambled to plug funding holes as best they can, primarily through transfers from general revenue. There is no specific reason why transport should be funded by transport revenues alone. But easy opportunities to tax&#8212;and thereby reduce&#8212;undesirable things are rare. In its current fiscal bind, America cannot afford to miss any. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Shalom, y'all</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Jewish communities are vanishing from the South&#8217;s small towns</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | AUBURN, ALABAMA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>LESS than 1% of the South&#8217;s population is Jewish, and southern Jews account for only 7% of American Jewry. This has not always been the case. In 1800 there were more Jews in Charleston, South Carolina than in any other American city&#8212;more than 500, or one-fifth of all American Jewry. Around 40,000 Jews moved south between the end of the American civil war and the beginning of the first world war, many of them working as small-town merchants. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That legacy remains in congregations dotted throughout the South, many of which are too small to afford a full-time rabbi. Which is where Marshal Klaven comes in. As director of rabbinical services at the Institute of Southern Jewish Life in Jackson, Mississippi, Mr Klaven, a 31-year-old former military chaplain, presides over 133 such congregations throughout the south, from Odessa, Texas in the west to Brunswick, Georgia in the east, and north as far as Leesburg, Virginia. He spends three or four weekends each month on the road. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On a recent Friday evening Mr Klaven led Shabbat services in Auburn, Alabama, near the Georgia border. The small temple, which was a Christian Science reading room until the congregation bought it in the spring of 1992, is tucked back on a winding residential street in the northern part of the city, not far from the university that shares its name with the town. Mr Klaven has a genial and easy manner, which helps when leading congregations he may only see once or twice each year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>By big-city standards, Auburn&#8217;s congregation is small&#8212;around 30 families&#8212;but by small-town southern standards it is thriving, with a broad age-range and enough children to sustain Sunday-school classes. During Passover Mr Klaven went to Vicksburg, Mississippi; Bowling Green, Kentucky; Rome and Dahlonega, Georgia; and to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he encouraged a full-time rabbi there to volunteer his time to nearby congregations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Rabbis are not uncommon in larger cities of the south. Atlanta, Nashville, Memphis and the Research Triangle area of North Carolina all have sizeable Jewish populations, even as those in smaller towns are ageing and dwindling. The community in Dothan, Alabama may have hit on a solution: they are offering Jewish families with children up to $50,000 to move there. That may not only help revive a century-old community but, if even more Jews were drawn south, it might help Mr Klaven with one of his most pressing concerns. He loves the South and hopes to remain in this post for a while. But, he says, finding a nice Jewish girl in Mississippi isn&#8217;t easy.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Liquid gold</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A long-declining region considers its most important asset</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | CHICAGO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR decades the Great Lakes region has seen a slow ebb. Factories have moved abroad or, more insulting, to the South. Residents have fled to sunnier states. But the lakes themselves remain; and while much of America is regularly afflicted by drought, they hold enough water to submerge the entire country. Now the Great Lakes states are reconsidering their main asset. Water, the boosters say, will bring prosperity once more. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The first task is to protect the water itself. Environmentalists raise the spectre of Central Asia&#8217;s Aral Sea, all but drained by Soviet irrigation projects. Nightmares have been fed by radical plans such as a scheme in the 1990s to ship water to Asia. More insidious threats include climate change and thirsty cities just beyond the Great Lakes Basin&#8212;death by 1,000 straws, according to Peter Annin&#8217;s &#8220;The Great Lakes Water Wars&#8221;. An important protection came in 2008, when George Bush signed the Great Lakes Compact. This agreement bars new diversions beyond the Great Lakes Basin, with few exceptions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Great Lakes states continue to have their own unique water problems, however. Illinois is exempt from the Compact. Since 1900, when engineers reversed the flow of the Chicago river, Illinois has sent Lake Michigan water down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. After decades of lawsuits, in 1967 the Supreme Court capped Illinois&#8217;s diversion at 2.1 billion gallons (8 billion litres) of water each day. The squabbling continues&#8212;most recently, Michigan tried to close the diversion to keep invading carp from reaching the lakes. But the long-term challenge for Illinois is to stay within the Supreme Court&#8217;s limit as the population grows. Twelve suburbs, a record, are asking for lake water. As aquifers are drained, more suburbs beyond the basin will ask for it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Planners are struggling to cut waste now to prevent scarcity later. &#8220;We see what appears to be this endless ocean of water, so I think we are spoiled,&#8221; explains Tim Loftus of the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP). Chicago is trying to become more efficient, replacing leaky pipes and installing water meters. In March CMAP recommended more than 240 measures to improve regional water management. But there is little money to implement them.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Broader demands and hopes for water, meanwhile, are playing out just north of Chicago in Wisconsin. The Compact will face its first test in Waukesha, west of Milwaukee. Waukesha sits beyond the Great Lakes Basin, but its county straddles the basin&#8217;s border. As <em>The Economist</em> went to press Waukesha was to become the first city beyond the basin to apply for lake water. (The city promises to send treated water back.) All eight Great Lakes states must approve the plan. If Waukesha succeeds, predicts David Naftzger of the Council of Great Lakes Governors, other cities may set their straws on the lakes, too. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Milwaukee itself exemplifies the hope that water may not only support growth, but catalyse it. Other cities want the lakes to attract new tourists and retired folk. In Milwaukee a three-year-old Water Council, led by local businessmen, intends to make the city a &#8220;World Water Hub&#8221; for water technology; the United Nations has already given it an official designation. On May 13th Wisconsin&#8217;s governor approved $50m for a new local graduate programme in freshwater science. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another approach is less esoteric. Milwaukee wants to raise water rates for existing customers to support its cash-strapped water supplier. (Milwaukee&#8217;s water would still remain some of America&#8217;s cheapest, though.) The city may also lower rates for new companies, a bid to lure some of the water-guzzling industries, like brewing, which once helped Milwaukee thrive. If residents from parched states follow, so much the better. Locals are squabbling over the plans. The sunbelt would love to have such fights. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The crushing of Arlen Specter</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Farewell to a feisty centrist</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AN ATTACK ad from a former vice-admiral hit Senator Arlen Specter like a homing torpedo. Mr Specter was a moderate Republican for 44 years before bolting from his party last year. Leading Democrats in Washington were elated. For a few sweet months Mr Specter&#8217;s switcheroo gave them a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. But the Democratic rank-and-file beyond the Beltway never warmed to him. It was not just his grouchiness, which long ago earned him the nickname &#8220;Snarlin&#8217; Arlen&#8221;. It was the fact that he had been, for most of his long life, a Republican. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He lost a Democratic primary on May 18th to Joe Sestak, a veteran of three wars but a relative newcomer to politics, having been elected to Congress in 2006. The ad that sank Mr Specter&#8217;s campaign began, simply: &#8220;I&#8217;m Joe Sestak, the Democrat.&#8221; Seldom has the definite article been so well-aimed. The ad then showed a haggard-looking Mr Specter saying: &#8220;My change in party will enable me to be re-elected.&#8221; Twice. It also showed Mr Specter being praised by George Bush and holding hands with Sarah Palin. It ended with the words: &#8220;Arlen Specter changed party to save one job. His, not yours.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For true believers of either stripe, Mr Specter is a hard man to like. Conservatives loathed him even before he left his party. He is pro-choice on abortion. He tried to stop the warrantless wiretapping of calls between people in America and suspected terrorists abroad. He loves trial lawyers; his son has made a fortune suing hospitals. He opposed Mr Bush&#8217;s surge of troops into Iraq, scoffing that it had no more chance of success than &#8220;a snowball in July&#8221;. He cast the deciding vote for Barack Obama&#8217;s stimulus bill. He tipped the scales against Robert Bork, a ferociously articulate conservative nominee for the Supreme Court, whose demonisation by Democrats in 1987 is still hotly resented by Republicans. The <em>National Review</em>, a conservative magazine, berated him as &#8220;The Worst Republican Senator&#8221;. He may not be the most unreliable Republican, wrote John Miller, &#8220;but he is almost certainly the most harmful, because he is smart, ruthless and influential.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Liberals love him no better. He voted for the invasion of Iraq and the Patriot Act. He backed Mr Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. He helped usher John Roberts and Samuel Alito onto the Supreme Court. Before that he backed Clarence Thomas, the most conservative member of the current court, and eviscerated Anita Hill, a co-worker who accused Mr Thomas of sexually harassing her. Senator Specter boasted that he had &#8220;flat-out demoli[shed] her credibility&#8221;. Feminists fumed that he had humiliated a victim. To this day, only Justice Thomas and Ms Hill know what really happened. Nonetheless, Mr Specter acquired some unforgiving enemies, and he has a knack for not making friends. His manner is brusque and prosecutorial: &#8220;cold to colleagues and cruel to staff&#8221;, as the <em>National Review</em> said. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From the way people talk about him, you&#8217;d think he was SPECTRE, the cabal of rootless villains who used to menace James Bond. He must have done something right, however. He is Pennsylvania&#8217;s longest-serving senator. It is no small feat to win five elections in a row in a swing state. In 2004 Pennsylvanians backed John Kerry by 51% to 48%, but Mr Specter held his seat by 53% to 42%. Even Mr Specter&#8217;s detractors admit he has both brains and tenacity. He rose from humble roots: his father was a Ukrainian immigrant who worked as a pedlar and eventually owned a junkyard. As a young lawyer, he worked on the Warren Commission investigating John Kennedy&#8217;s assassination. His conclusion&#8212;that a lone gunman did it&#8212;infuriated conspiracy theorists. He ran unsuccessfully for mayor (of Philadelphia), senator and governor before finally winning a Senate seat in 1980. He overcame a brain tumour, open heart surgery and Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma. His memoir was called &#8220;Never Give In&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He is a moderate in a country where the loudest voices applaud immoderation. When Republicans had a majority, he nonetheless urged his party&#8217;s leaders not to change Senate rules to disempower the minority. He pushed for a more welcoming immigration policy. And if he is rude, so what? Someone needed to tell Joe Biden to pipe down, and Alberto Gonzales, Mr Bush&#8217;s useless attorney-general, that his testimony &#8220;defie[d] logic and plain English&#8221;. <em>Time</em>, a centrist magazine, judged Mr Specter one of America&#8217;s ten best senators in 2006.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But his fence-sitting sometimes verged on the ridiculous. During Bill Clinton&#8217;s impeachment he refused to vote &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;not guilty&#8221;, opting instead for &#8220;not proven&#8221;, a verdict allowed in Scottish courts but not in America. He voted both for and against school vouchers, while sending his own children to private schools. When he was a Republican, conservatives grumbled that he voted conservatively only in the run-up to a Republican primary. Yet Harry Reid, the leading Democrat in the Senate, grumbled in his memoirs (written before Mr Specter changed party) that &#8220;Arlen Specter&#8230;is always with us when we don&#8217;t need him.&#8221; After joining the Democrats, he voted with his new party 90% of the time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He switched parties when he realised that he was going to lose a Republican primary. He lost the Democratic primary because Democrats don&#8217;t trust him, either. With the national mood so hostile to incumbents, it probably did not help that he is the fifth-oldest senator, and sounds it. (He sometimes asks people with whom he disagrees if they have been smoking Dutch cleanser, a brand of cleaning powder that was apparently popular a long time ago.) Most of all, though, he showed how tough it is to be a centrist. Jim Hightower, a populist pundit, once jeered that &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.&#8221; For decades, Mr Specter was an agile armadillo, constantly dodging the two-way traffic. But this week, his footwork finally failed him. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>A burst of Chinese-level growth cannot be sustained. But it hints at Brazil&#8217;s new-found strength, and is perfectly timed for the presidential election</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | S\xC3O PAULO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NEW skyscrapers are going up along Avenida Faria Lima in the business district of S\xE3o Paulo. Sales of computers and cars are booming, while a glut of passengers has clogged the main airports. Brazil created 962,000 new formal-sector jobs between January and April&#8212;the highest figure for these months since records began in 1992. Everything indicates that over the past six months the economy has grown at an annualised pace of over 10%. Even allowing for an expected slackening, many analysts forecast that growth in 2010 will be 7%&#8212;the highest rate since 1986.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The problem is that while it may be growing at Chinese speeds, Brazil is not China. Because it still saves and invests too little, most economists think it is restricted to a speed limit of 5% at the most, if it is not to crash. The growth spurt is partly the result of the stimulus measures taken by President Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva&#8217;s government when the world financial crisis briefly tipped the country into recession late in 2008. The trouble, say critics, is that much of the extra government spending is turning out to be permanent&#8212;and so the economy is starting to resemble a Toyota with the accelerator stuck to the floor.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The strain is showing. Businesses are chasing after scarce skilled labour. Inflation for the 12 months to April reached 5.3%, above the Central Bank&#8217;s target of 4.5%. Imports are set to top exports this year, for the first time since 2000, and the current-account deficit should widen to 3% of GDP. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The authorities are starting to worry. Last month the Central Bank raised its benchmark Selic interest rate by 0.75%, the first rise in nearly two years. Many economists in S\xE3o Paulo believe that this one will be followed by others, taking the rate from its low of 8.75% to 13% by next year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government&#8217;s critics say that lax fiscal policy is making the Central Bank&#8217;s task harder, increasing the risk of the boom ending in a sharp slowdown next year. When he became president in 2003, Lula stuck to the sound fiscal policies he inherited from his predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Thanks to faster growth and higher tax revenues, between 2003 and 2008 Lula&#8217;s government managed to keep public debt in check even while expanding spending. By treating the recession as &#8220;a licence to spend&#8221;, the government is now undermining the credibility it piled up, says Raul Velloso, a public-finance specialist in Brasilia.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Officials share those concerns&#8212;up to a point. The government has withdrawn nearly all of the tax breaks it enacted to boost demand during the recession. On May 13th ministers declared that they would shave 10 billion reais ($5.4 billion) from the running costs of the federal government this year. That followed a similar announcement of another 21 billion reais of cuts in March. But this hardly amounts to slamming on the brakes. The cuts are to the generous (and notional) budget approved by Congress. Even if implemented in full, they will merely slow the rate of increase in government spending, keeping it constant or slightly lower as a share of GDP, concedes Nelson Barbosa, a senior finance official.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government is still injecting money into the economy in two controversial ways. First, the National Development Bank (BNDES), whose loans cost about half the Selic rate, has expanded its lending by almost half. It has been able to do this because the treasury granted it two long-term credits totalling 180 billion reais. Those credits, for which the BNDES has offered IOUs, have led to accusations of creative accounting. While adding to the government&#8217;s gross debt, they have not driven up the more closely watched figure for public debt, net of assets: at 42.7% of GDP, this is back to its level of mid-2008, and is much lower than the debt burdens of European countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Second, the government has jacked up its payroll spending. The number of federal civil servants has increased fairly modestly since 2003 (by around 10%). But they have been treated generously: the total federal wage bill more than doubled in nominal terms between 2003 and 2009, while inflation was less than 50%. Lula has pushed up the minimum wage much faster than inflation too. That has helped to make the income distribution less skewed, and boosted consumer demand. But it has a knock-on effect on pension benefits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Barbosa insists that faster growth will allow the government to squeeze payroll and pension spending gently over the coming years. The BNDES helped sustain investment when the financial markets seized up. The latest bout of financial turmoil has seen the real depreciate by 5% or so this month. But Brazil&#8217;s stockpile of international reserves means it is well-placed to withstand market panics. Mr Barbosa says that the critics should look at the long-term trend, under which real interest rates (ie, after inflation) have fallen from up to 20% in 2003 to between 5% and 10%. Once the new monetary squeeze is over they will fall further, he says.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Certainly many Europeans would love to have Brazil&#8217;s problems. Its economy has acquired underlying strength. Companies are scurrying to satisfy the demand for consumer goods of a rapidly expanding lower-middle class, while China continues to suck in Brazil&#8217;s exports of raw materials. Productivity is rising. Costs per unit of labour are increasing at only about half the rate of real wages, reckons Jos\xE9 Roberto Mendon\xE7a de Barros, a consultant and former finance official.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But commodity prices are starting to weaken. Faster growth would be more assured if the government made room for lower interest rates and installed better infrastructure. The next president, elected in October, will have to tackle this. The economy&#8217;s red-hot start to the election year has increased the chance that it will be Lula&#8217;s candidate, Dilma Rousseff, who gets the chance to try.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>An unappetising menu</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Mr Calder\xF3n goes to Washington</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | MEXICO CITY | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Barack Obama invited his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder\xF3n, to be his guest in Washington for only the second state visit of his presidency, he was underlining that the two neighbours have become friends. Yet the timing of the trip, on May 19th, has turned out to be unfortunate. It comes amid a furious row on both sides of the border over a law approved in Arizona last month, which requires state police to check the immigration status of any &#8220;suspicious&#8221; individuals, apparently meaning Mexicans. And on May 14th a senior member of Mr Calder\xF3n&#8217;s conservative National Action Party (PAN), Diego Fern\xE1ndez de Cevallos, went missing from his ranch. It seems he had been abducted. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At least Mr Calder\xF3n and Mr Obama had plenty to talk about over dinner at the White House, even if the issues&#8212;migration and the drug &#8220;war&#8221;&#8212;are depressingly familiar. When Mr Calder\xF3n visited Washington shortly before Mr Obama&#8217;s inauguration, the two leaders proclaimed a new era of partnership. But relations between their two countries often seem stuck in a pattern of flare-ups and make-ups: over American protectionism, human-rights abuses by Mexico&#8217;s army, drug violence spilling over the border and the southward flows of guns and cash.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Arizona law marks a new nadir. Mr Calder\xF3n called the measure &#8220;backward&#8221; and &#8220;discriminatory&#8221;. His government issued a travel alert, which will discourage citizens from visiting the state. The governors of Mexico&#8217;s border states said they would boycott a routine meeting with their American counterparts in Phoenix. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Will the state visit break the pattern? Diplomats from both countries note that their daily collaboration has improved. Co-operation on security is probably closer than it has ever been. American officials have begun searching southbound traffic and seizing illicit cargo. The M\xE9rida initiative, a scheme under which the United States has offered Mexico modest anti-drug aid, has been extended and tweaked to emphasise strengthening institutions, such as the judiciary. Mexico has extradited suspected narcos in unprecedented numbers. Mr Obama shares Mr Calder\xF3n&#8217;s opposition to the Arizona law, calling it &#8220;misguided&#8221;. He would like to enact a comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As so often, the main obstacle to further progress is domestic politics in both countries. Many Americans in border states support cracking down on illegal migrants, and Mr Obama&#8217;s Democratic Party faces difficult mid-term elections in November. If Mexico protests too much, it risks galvanising the law&#8217;s backers, which could lead other states to copy Arizona&#8217;s policies.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, Mr Calder\xF3n&#8217;s party was routed in Mexico&#8217;s mid-terms last July, and will have to confront voters again in local elections this summer. He has almost no chance of obtaining the big policy reforms needed to address the country&#8217;s economic and security troubles. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Polls suggest that Mexicans are becoming sceptical of Mr Calder\xF3n&#8217;s insistence that he is beating the drug gangs. They may not be reassured by the recent leaking of an internal government estimate that 23,000 people have been killed in the violence since 2006. That is well above the 18,000 previously reckoned by the press.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The traffickers are getting ever more brazen. In March they gunned down three people with ties to the American consulate in Ciudad Ju\xE1rez. Although several local politicians have been killed by the mafias, Mr Fern\xE1ndez de Cevallos is a far more prominent figure. He was a former presidential candidate, highly influential in the pan and close to Mexico&#8217;s security establishment. If he has indeed been murdered&#8212;or if he were to be held hostage for months&#8212;the pressure on Mr Calder\xF3n to rethink the intensity of his assault on the drug gangs might well grow. And so might the concern in Washington.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h2>Chasing the aid-worker&#8217;s dollar</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | PORT-AU-PRINCE | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE catastrophic earthquake that killed perhaps 220,000 people in Haiti in January has brought a flood of aid workers and other outsiders to Port-au-Prince, the capital. Rebuilding has still barely begun. But many enterprising Haitians are seizing the opportunity to supply services to the well-heeled newcomers. On top of the inflow of foreign aid, this is helping to get the economy moving again. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The outsiders&#8217; first need is shelter. Many of the city&#8217;s hotels were damaged in the quake, and the largest, the Montana, completely collapsed. Virtually all the surviving hotels have raised their rates but are still booked solid. That has forced many relief workers to sleep outside. But while homeless locals must crowd into flimsy and dangerous tent cities, foreigners can pay $50 a night for an air-conditioned tent on the lawn of the Palm Inn, a hotel by the airport.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The next requirement is transport. Car dealers are struggling to meet demand, particularly for the white trucks and SUVs that are the NGOs&#8217; wheels of choice. Driver-interpreters can take home $200 a day. Port-au-Prince&#8217;s snarling traffic is now punctuated by curses in Chinese and Cuban Spanish. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Because transport is so difficult, relief workers often cannot get to cafeterias or restaurants for lunch. Many have turned to Abraham Pierre-Mary, an aspiring entrepreneur. He delivers chicken and rice, packed in styrofoam boxes, to their offices for around $4 a plate&#8212;twice last year&#8217;s price.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The worry is that the aid workers will merely push up inflation. To develop, Haiti needs investment in textiles and tourism, not climate-controlled bivouacs. &#8220;Haiti is a nation, not a refugee camp,&#8221; says Patrick Moynihan, the president of the Haitian Project, a Catholic education group. &#8220;NGOs are like one-night stands. They will romance the country to get their fix right up until a more interesting disaster comes along.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Their number is up</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Evidence that North Korea torpedoed the Cheonan puts it&#8212;and China&#8212;on the spot</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | SEOUL AND TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHOEVER failed to erase the words &#8220;Number One&#8221; in blue Korean script etched inside the propulsion shaft of a deadly torpedo may well be in deep trouble in Pyongyang. On May 15th a ship dredging the site of the attack on a South Korean warship in March that killed 46 seamen made a spectacular find: propellers, motors and a steering section that international investigators say &#8220;perfectly match&#8221; those of a CHT-02D torpedo that North Korea sells abroad. What&#8217;s more, the blue marking was similar to one on a previously captured North Korean torpedo. This was as close to a smoking gun as the South Koreans could have hoped to find.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The discovery, combined with intelligence reports indicating North Korean submarines were out of port during the attack, allowed the investigators to conclude on May 20th that the <em>Cheonan</em> &#8220;was sunk as the result of an external underwater explosion caused by a torpedo made in North Korea.&#8221; Or as one person close to the investigation succinctly put it: &#8220;It was either the North Koreans, or it was the Martians.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The South Korean government of President Lee Myung-bak had barely dared hope to find hard evidence of North Korean guilt, however strong its suspicions. In doing so, it pushes the belligerent regime in Pyongyang into a corner. True to form, it continued to deny its involvement on May 20th, calling the investigation a &#8220;fabrication&#8221; and threatened &#8220;all-out war&#8221; if new sanctions were imposed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Diplomats say it will also make it harder for North Korea &#8217;s main ally, China, not to accept the regime&#8217;s culpability. A senior official in Beijing reportedly called the incident &#8220;very unfortunate&#8221;. He did not comment on the investigation, though an official in Seoul said China&#8217;s ambassador was briefed on the results on May 18th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In coming days China will come under pressure to issue a tougher response, during what could be some uncomfortable diplomatic meetings. Hillary Clinton, America&#8217;s secretary of state, is to visit Beijing on May 24th and 25th. Following that, the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan are scheduled to hold a summit in South Korea on May 29th and 30th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The proof of North Korean involvement, say diplomats, may help South Korea and its allies persuade China to back some form of United Nations condemnation of the attack. South Korea&#8217;s allies such as America, Japan, Britain and Australia were quick to express their outrage. But the toughest condemnation, in the form of a Security-Council resolution, needs China&#8217;s support, or at least abstention. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Beyond diplomatic measures, South Korea&#8217;s retaliatory options are relatively puny&#8212;and dangerous. South Korean diplomats suggest that the government may announce a halt to remaining business ties with the North, except through the cross-border industrial complex, known as Kaesong. It may close a shipping shortcut to North Korean vessels, and conduct joint training exercises with American maritime forces in the Yellow Sea.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A retaliatory strike, which some hawkish South Koreans are calling for, is something the pro-business President Lee is considered reluctant to do for fear of escalating the conflict. His party faces local elections that it is expected to win on June 2nd (his liberal opponents already accuse him, perhaps unfairly, of using the incident for political ends). After that he hosts an important G20 summit in November. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Among the population at large, there seems little stomach for a fight. Indeed, despite a national outpouring of grief, the senseless attack aroused surprisingly few public demonstrations of wrath with the North. Brian Myers, a writer on North Korea, notes that there was more palpable anger in 2002 when an American army vehicle ran over two South Korean schoolgirls.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, he and other North Korea watchers think tough measures may eventually be called for. The more the cash-strapped regime in Pyongyang feels economically isolated, the more it is likely to step up its provocations against the South unless it is decisively put in its place, Mr Myers says. As it is, the North is in desperate economic straits. Six-party talks that aimed to encourage it to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for cash are stalled indefinitely as a result of the torpedo attack. International sanctions have hit other sources of hard currency.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China is its economic lifeline, as was shown again when Kim Jong Il, North Korea&#8217;s dictator, made a hasty trip to Beijing not long after the <em>Cheonan</em> incident to beg for continued economic support. At that point, Beijing had an excuse, in public at least, to take his claims of innocence at face value. It no longer does. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>You may get wise monkeys: the Japanese press ignores a juicy story</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN MANY parts of the world, journalists would be unable to resist a good political slush-fund scandal. In Japan, information is dribbling out about a murky stash of cash kept in a black box near the prime minister&#8217;s office that for decades has been used to curry political favour&#8212;even, it is said, among journalists and television commentators. Tellingly, the Japanese media are reacting to the scandal like the three wise monkeys of Nikko: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The existence of the fund has long been known to insiders. Now, for the first time, a sitting government has admitted to its existence. In a letter to the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) on May 14th, Hirofumi Hirano, chief cabinet secretary in the government of Yukio Hatoyama, has confirmed he withdrew \xA5360m ($3.8m) between September and March, and returned an unused portion of just \xA516m to the exchequer. Asked by a JCP lawmaker in parliament in March what record he had kept of the expenditure, he helpfully replied: &#8220;It is in my mind.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Hirano says he has no plans for the time being to disclose what the money was spent on, for fear of damaging &#8220;the national interest&#8221;. Nor does he expect to stop dipping into the pot. He also appeared reluctant to investigate the outgoing administration of Taro Aso, which raided the fund last year just before it handed over power to Mr Hatoyama. Two days after the election, and two weeks before leaving office, it withdrew \xA5250m.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The mainstream press has been strangely reticent on the matter. Besides a long article in the Communist-leaning <em>RedFlag</em>, the scandal has received just snippets of coverage in national newspapers. That may be for fear of being smeared by their own story. Last month, Hiromu Nonaka, one of Mr Hirano&#8217;s predecessors as chief cabinet secretary, revealed that between 1998 and 1999 he spent up to \xA570m ($600,000 at the exchange rate of the time) per month from his secret little piggy bank. That included \xA510m for the prime minister and \xA510m for politicians in the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But it also included money strewn among press commentators and members of opposition parties. Some was splurged on sending them on trips to North Korea.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The 84-year-old Mr Nonaka made the confession, he said, because he did not want to carry the secret to the grave about what he rightly referred to as taxpayers&#8217; money. But he may have been making mischief, too, for Mr Hatoyama&#8217;s Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which drove the LDP from power last year on a platform of transparency and accountability.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Takao Toshikawa, editor of <em>Tokyo Inside Line</em>, a political newsletter, who once wrote a book on slush funds, says he doubts pay-offs still go to the media. But he adds that there is a rumour that some slush-fund largesse has been lavished on wining and dining residents of Okinawa, notably those who oppose the government&#8217;s plan to relocate an American marine base on their island. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some people might shrug off such funds as part of the old Japanese tradition of gift-giving, albeit involving some rather generous presents. But for a government that has long promised to dig up the &#8220;buried treasure&#8221; hidden in such secret accounts to improve public finances, it is extraordinary that it, too, is taking such brazen advantage of this darkest of slush funds. Just as extraordinary, not to mention suspicious, is the impressive silence from most of the powerful mass media. More evidence, if it were needed, of the central role they play in Japan&#8217;s longstanding political dysfunction. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Protest vote</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Less than a referendum on democracy, more than a farce</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | HONG KONG | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;IF THE Communist Party had a plan to split the pro-democracy camp, they couldn&#8217;t have got a better script,&#8221; says Emily Lau, a Hong Kong legislator and veteran pro-democracy activist. An attempt by some of Hong Kong&#8217;s politicians to turn by-elections on May 16th into a de facto referendum on political reform resulted in a record low turnout and bitterness between once close allies. The party, however, still has plenty to worry about. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As expected, all five of the pro-democracy politicians who resigned from Hong Kong&#8217;s Legislative Council, or Legco, in January were re-elected. They had virtually no opposition, after China made it clear to its supporters in Hong Kong that they were to boycott the event. Even Hong Kong&#8217;s chief executive, Donald Tsang, said two days before the ballot that neither he nor members of his cabinet would vote. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This was a blow to the legislators and their parties, the League of Social Democrats and the Civic Party. The two groups had hoped that they could turn the territory-wide by-elections into a trial of strength between supporters of full-fledged democracy in Hong Kong and conservative groups. The conservatives, backed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), say they want democracy, but are loth to give up mechanisms that skew results in favour of pro-China loyalists. The resigning legislators failed to persuade even the Democratic Party, the biggest pro-democracy group in Legco, to back their decision to force the by-elections. Ms Lau, the party&#8217;s vice-chairman, says her group&#8217;s supporters thought the plan was &#8220;a farce&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The outcome was not quite that. CCP loyalists scoffed at the 17% turnout, which was the lowest in Legco&#8217;s electoral history. But considering that the five main candidates were a shoo-in, some pro-democracy politicians were comforted that more than 570,000 people bothered to cast their ballots at all. One way of looking at this is to recognise that most of the voters on May 16th were in effect protesters; and only rarely have protest rallies in Hong Kong attracted such numbers. The Chinese government had said that the candidates&#8217; attempts to portray the by-elections as a referendum were a &#8220;fundamental contravention&#8221; of Hong Kong&#8217;s constitution. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Democratic Party was initially afraid that the attempted referendum could turn into an embarrassment for the pro-democracy camp if the CCP&#8217;s allies in Hong Kong decided to take part. There was a risk that one or two of the pro-democracy legislators would not regain their seats. Such a loss could have made it much more difficult for democrats in Legco to block the government&#8217;s cautious plans for political reform. These are widely expected to be voted on by Legco late next month. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government faces a tough battle to get its proposals passed. Democrats worry that they deal only with interim reforms to be enacted in 2012 and do not give a sufficient commitment to genuine universal suffrage, which China has said will be possible in 2017 in elections for Hong Kong&#8217;s chief executive and 2020 for Legco. Democrats believe the government wants to keep &#8220;functional constituencies&#8221;, representing certain professions, which currently return half of Legco&#8217;s seats. Their voters tend to be pro-government. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China promised universal suffrage to Hong Kong when it took over from Britain in 1997. But the only other attempt by the Hong Kong government to introduce a reform bill was voted down by Legco in 2005 because of similar doubts among democrats. Another failure would be a big setback for Mr Tsang and a snub to the CCP. But the CCP&#8217;s orchestration of the by-election boycott suggested its fears of losing face are outweighed by its abhorrence of any expression of the popular will.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Dispense with the pieties</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Frank talk from the president</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | JAKARTA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT TAKES a lot to rile Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Indonesia&#8217;s cool, nay, bland, president. But Indonesia&#8217;s home-grown terrorists do seem to make his blood boil. On May 12th and 13th counter-terrorism police staged a series of raids around Java, killing five suspects and detaining 20 others. The police say the group was plotting to assassinate high-ranking officials, including the president himself.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a televised appeal to the nation on May 17th Mr Yudhoyono declared that the captured terrorists were bent on &#8220;building an Islamic state, something that is now history for us&#8221;. Their group, a splinter cell of South-East Asia&#8217;s Jemaah Islamiah network (JI), would also like to put paid to Indonesia&#8217;s fledgling democracy. But it was Mr Yudhoyono&#8217;s words about Islam and its place in Indonesia that drew attention. To change the country&#8217;s constitution in favour of an avowedly Islamic one, he said, would be &#8220;unacceptable to Indonesians&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indonesia&#8217;s founding fathers rejected establishing an Islamic state back in 1945. Elections, most recently last year, have shown that, although 86% of Indonesians are Muslim, political Islam is not popular. The country&#8217;s proliferation of small but influential minorities, including Christians, Hindus and Buddhists, has long suggested that the only way to keep the republic together is to avoid giving one religion privileges at the expense of others. But no national leader has dared to say it. Had Mr Yudhoyono made the point when he first campaigned for the presidency in 2004, his opponents would have pigeonholed him as an un-Islamic candidate.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the years since, Mr Yudhoyono&#8217;s administration has remained nearly silent about the antics of Islamic vigilante groups. They have trashed bars and nightclubs, harassed churches and beaten religious figures who promote pluralism. When their political backers pushed a controversial anti-pornography law through parliament in 2008, Mr Yudhoyono&#8217;s party joined them. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The previous president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was similarly indulgent towards Islamist politicians. Worse, Miss Megawati was oblivious to evidence of terrorist activity within Indonesia. Mr Yudhoyono&#8217;s administration, for its part, once claimed that JI did not even exist&#8212;on the ground that it was not officially registered as a terrorist organisation. At times Mr Yudhoyono has refrained from uttering the group&#8217;s name, his critics claim, because &#8220;Jemaah Islamiah&#8221; means &#8220;Islamic community&#8221;; he feared he might anger voters by associating Islam with terrorism.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Yudhoyono&#8217;s former diffidence makes his new posture all the more striking. A counter-terrorism official says it does not stem from the president&#8217;s anger at having been a target himself. It is the terrorists&#8217; ultimate aims that offend him: he sees Indonesia&#8217;s hard-won democracy in their sights. He mentioned in his speech that the terrorists are expanding their range of targets to include ordinary Indonesian citizens, not just foreigners and himself. Whatever spurred the president, a dose of candour can be good for all.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Thinking the worst</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Not an unmitigated tactical success</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | KOSHKAKY | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE nightmare began with gunfire. Residents of this poor village in eastern Afghanistan were jolted awake by what sounded like shooting from their guards at thieves outside their compound. Moments later, they say, soldiers spilled over the walls in a flurry of grenades and bullets that left at least eight people dead, including a father and his four sons. The American army said the raid&#8217;s targets were militants, including a Taliban sub-commander, who was killed. Two insurgents were captured, it said, along with automatic rifles and &#8220;communications equipment&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It was the second deadly night raid in Surkh Rod district in as many weeks. And if the finger-pointing is predictable, so is the fallout. Within hours a mob of hundreds of neighbours and relations filled the streets, wielding torches and throwing stones, to chants of &#8220;Death to America&#8221; and &#8220;Long Live the Taliban&#8221;. Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan&#8217;s president, and Gul Agha Sherzai, a former warlord from Kandahar who now governs Nangarhar province, were similarly cursed. Some protesters smashed windows in an attempt to storm local-government offices. The police shot back, killing at least one more person. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The number of civilians killed in air strikes has fallen since General Stanley McChrystal took command of international forces in Afghanistan last year. But there has been a rise in casualties in &#8220;night raids&#8221;. Of nearly 600 civilian deaths attributed to foreign troops last year, raids accounted for more than half. An errant special-forces raid in Paktia province on February 12th killed an Afghan police officer, his brother, two pregnant women and a teenage girl celebrating a birth. A rare formal apology was made. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even when no one is killed, the trauma of doors being kicked down and women exposed to strangers is seen as a grave affront. Domestic raids deepen the anger and distrust felt by ordinary Afghans. General McChrystal noted as much in January, when he issued a new directive to avoid needless casualties and heavy-handed intrusions. Afghan troops would take the lead on missions and local elders were to be consulted in advance &#8220;whenever possible&#8221;. The guidelines have made regular soldiers more cautious. But they do not apply to special-forces units. Engaged in &#8220;black&#8221; operations to disrupt the Taliban leadership structure, they worry consultation might jeopardise their campaign. Dozens of commanders are said to have been captured or killed ahead of a southern offensive soon to be mounted around Kandahar. But the tactical impact of their operations has to be weighed against the cost fatal mistakes exact in local goodwill. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Koshkaky is just 14km (9 miles) west of Jalalabad, a calm city firmly in the hands of the government. Nasratullah Arsala, head of the provincial council, insists the area is &#8220;Taliban-free&#8221;. Local residents readily check off the raid victims&#8217; names and ages. Witnesses say that after the assault they were interrogated for hours and stripped of mobile phones and the guns they keep to defend themselves against bandits. A similar story is told by Safiya Sidiqi, a local member of parliament, about a raid on April 29th, in which her family home was shot up, killing a relation who thought the house was being robbed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Whatever happened that night in Koshkaky, many Afghans suspect the worst. A history of botched raids and air strikes by coalition forces lends rumours of their alleged mistakes credibility, even where the insurgency is weak. As the war intensifies and mishaps multiply around the country, winning hearts and minds may become even harder. A neighbour of the victims in Koshkaky speaks for many: &#8220;If the Americans do this again, we are ready to shed our blood against them. We would rather die than sit by and do nothing.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>A GRIM prospect looms for Dr Mohen Singh, superintendent of the biggest hospital in Imphal, capital of Manipur, in India&#8217;s remote north-east. Since early April, when protesters blocked the two highways linking Manipur to the rest of India, supplies of medicine have dwindled. On May 10th Dr Singh directed his staff to halt all but emergency operations. A day later the government airlifted in emergency supplies of rice and medicine. But oxygen canisters cannot be transported by air. In a fortnight, even life-saving surgery will be impossible. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Life in Manipur, wracked by insurgency and under a draconian act giving special powers to the armed forces, is never easy. The blockade has made it even more perilous. It was started on April 11th by Naga tribespeople, in protest at Manipur&#8217;s announcement of local elections in Naga-inhabited areas of the state later this month. Nagas live in several states besides their own, Nagaland. They have fought a six-decade insurgency for an autonomous &#8220;Greater Nagaland&#8221; including chunks of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. A ceasefire with the government has largely held since 1997. But successive rounds of peace talks have yielded little. Non-Naga Manipuris, however, who have their own violent secessionist movement, are alarmed by Naga ambitions. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The blockade was given new impetus earlier this month when Manipur&#8217;s government stopped Thuingaleng Muivah, the leader of the separatist group with which the government signed the ceasefire, from visiting the Manipuri village where he was born. This sparked violent protests in Mao, a town near the Nagaland-Manipur border. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Muivah planned to address large rallies. He made the unsettling assurance that &#8220;we will not claim anything which belongs to the Meiteis&#8221;, ie, Manipur&#8217;s majority group. Manipur&#8217;s harsh response to his planned visit has inflamed Naga secessionists. Mr Muivah, a 75-year-old former guerrilla, has meanwhile dug in his heels and is camping with his followers near the border. Manipur badly needs compromise as well as oxygen. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Reconciliation takes a back seat as a band of brothers settles in</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | DELHI | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THERE is no stopping the remorseless ascent of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka&#8217;s president. A year ago this week his government routed the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) after a 26-year civil war. This January, after a campaign featuring songs lauding him as a &#8220;king&#8221;, his grateful citizens re-elected him in a landslide. His party then cantered to victory in a parliamentary poll in April. His main rival in the presidential race, Sarath Fonseka, a former army chief, faces a court-martial and poses no threat. Now the president seems intent on an extraordinary concentration of power into his family&#8217;s hands, and on its prolongation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Rajapaksa himself, besides being president, is minister of defence, finance and planning, ports and aviation, and highways. In all, he is directly responsible for 78 institutions. One, the defence ministry, is a condominium with his brother, Gotabaya, the defence secretary. Besides control of the armed forces, police and coast guard, it has expanded its remit to take in immigration and emigration, as well as, curiously, the Urban Development Authority and the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another Rajapaksa brother, Basil, is economic-development minister and senior presidential adviser, with oversight, among other things, of wildlife conservation and the boards of both investment- and tourism-promotion. He also runs a presidential task force set up to develop the war-ravaged north and east.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A fourth brother, the eldest, Chamal, has forsaken his former cabinet seat. All is not lost, however. He has been elected unopposed as speaker of parliament. In the unlikely event that the president were to face impeachment, which would require a motion signed by at least half of the members of parliament, the speaker would have to agree to entertain the motion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The family reportedly also <em></em>wants to leave its imprint on Sri Lanka&#8217;s constitution. One aim is to lift the present bar on presidents serving more than two six-year terms. A second is to revise the 17th amendment to empower the president to appoint members of a number of important bodies, such as the human-rights and election commissions, and others covering the police, public service and the investigation of corruption. This would defeat the purpose of the 17th amendment: to curtail presidential power. It would also take power away from ethnic minorities, to whose representatives the 17th amendment gave a say in some appointments.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A third proposed change is to enable the president to take part in parliamentary proceedings. Basil Rajapaksa has said this will be similar to &#8220;question time&#8221; in Britain, &#8220;though not exact&#8221;. Far from weakening the &#8220;executive presidency&#8221;, as many have advocated, the reforms would in effect give Mr Rajapaksa some prime-ministerial trappings as well. It is unlikely, however, that the president will face the sort of abuse hurled at British prime ministers in the House of Commons.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He does, however, face some criticism. At home, it is somewhat muted, though the <em>Sunday Leader</em> did note that Sri Lanka &#8220;seems to have reached a point of one-family rule. Every aspect of our lives from the registry of our births, to the taxes we pay&#8230;and the documents we must carry in order to move freely is under the control of Rajapaksas. Their domination is absolute.&#8221; That newspaper is a rare source of dissent. Its former editor was shot dead by unknown assassins last year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Critics also lament the lack of progress towards national reconciliation. Despite insisting that its enemy was the LTTE, not the Tamil minority it claimed to represent, the government has done little to ease Tamil grievances. And far from making serious plans for the devolution of power, seen as essential to ethnic harmony, the trend is relentless centralisation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Criticism is even fiercer abroad. Human-rights groups marked this week&#8217;s anniversary with a renewed push for an international inquiry into alleged war crimes by both sides. The International Crisis Group, a think-tank, produced a report offering evidence of abuses by government troops, including attacks on hospitals, humanitarian-aid convoys and civilians. It estimated that 30,000 civilians or more may have died in the war&#8217;s final weeks, and that &#8220;all but a small portion of these deaths were due to government fire.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Perhaps in an effort to deflect external pressure, the government has announced the formation of a &#8220;Lessons learnt and reconciliation commission&#8221;. But, based on the experience of previous national commissions of inquiry, outsiders are unlikely to trust this one. Its terms of reference are anyway not to investigate alleged war crimes, but the whole period from February 2002, when the government and the Tigers signed an abortive ceasefire.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Tigers were brutal and loathsome. Yet Sri Lanka&#8217;s leading Tamil party in the north of the country marked the anniversary of the war&#8217;s end as an occasion for mourning. The government, by contrast, planned a big parade in Colombo. It had to be called off because of flooding.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Little else is raining on the Rajapaksas&#8217; parade. The president is just 64, seems in good health and is still popular among the Sinhalese majority. Nothing seems to stand in the way of a long Rajapaksa <em>raj</em>. And, moving in from the wings, his son, Namal, elected to parliament in April, seems set to follow in his father&#8217;s and uncles&#8217; footsteps. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The rush to learn lessons from the obliteration of the Tamil Tigers</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>LITTLE Sri Lanka is rarely a model of anything. But since it crushed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam its government has found itself in an unfamiliar position. Some of the world&#8217;s less savoury regimes are beating a path to its door to study &#8220;the Sri Lanka option&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Last November, Myanmar&#8217;s military dictator, Than Shwe, who rarely travels abroad, visited the island &#8220;so that his regime can apply any lessons learned to its efforts against the ethnic groups in Burma,&#8221; says Benedict Rogers, a biographer of General Than. In May last year at a meeting of regional defence ministers in Singapore, Myanmar&#8217;s deputy minister made the link explicit, saying the world had witnessed a victory over terrorism in Sri Lanka but had forgotten about the insurgency in his country.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In October Thailand&#8217;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, held talks with his Sri Lankan counterpart about the lessons of the Tigers&#8217; defeat (for handling a Muslim insurgency in southern Thailand, not the protests cleared this week in Bangkok). In March a military delegation from Bangladesh met Sri Lanka&#8217;s army chief, to swap notes on what he called Sri Lanka&#8217;s &#8220;successful completion of the war for peace&#8221;. Behind the scenes, hawkish generals and politicians from Colombia to Israel seem to be using Sri Lanka&#8217;s experience to justify harsher anti-terror operations.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Louise Arbour, head of the International Crisis Group (ICG), says the Sri Lanka model consists of three parts: what she dubs &#8220;scorched-earth tactics&#8221; (full operational freedom for the army, no negotiations with terrorists, no ceasefires to let them regroup); next, ignoring differences between combatants and non-combatants (the new ICG report documents many such examples); lastly, the dismissal of international and media concerns. A senior official in President Mahinda Rajapaksa&#8217;s office, quoted anonymously in a journal, <em>Indian Defence Review</em>, says &#8220;we had to ensure that we regulated the media. We didn&#8217;t want the international community to force peace negotiations on us.&#8221; The author of that article, V.K. Shashikumar, concludes that &#8220;in the final analysis the Rajapaksa model is based on a military precept&#8230;Terrorism has to be wiped out militarily and cannot be tackled politically.&#8221; This is the opposite of the strategy America is pursuing in Afghanistan. It is winning a widespread hearing.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>In the strongman's shadow</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Central Asia is turning east&#8212;but still needs to shed its Soviet frailties</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NASTY, brutish and long: these seem to be what the leaders of Central Asia&#8217;s states intend their rule to be. Kazakhstan, the region&#8217;s biggest country, and Uzbekistan, its most populous, have as good as presidents for life. Nursultan Nazarbayev and Islam Karimov have been in power since Soviet days and they manipulate elections or the constitution to stay there. Tajikistan&#8217;s strongman is only slightly less long-lived. Turkmenistan had a self-styled &#8220;President for Life&#8221;, who proved mortal in 2006. His successor also seems to be settling in for the long haul.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That leaves tiny Kyrgyzstan, which is slightly different. Bloody unrest last month unseated the now exiled president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Mr Bakiyev himself had toppled a corrupt, authoritarian Soviet-era president before growing corrupt and authoritarian himself. An interim government intends to settle a parliamentary democracy on the troubled country. A measure of the challenge is that, in many ways, Kyrgyzstan is little different from its Central Asian neighbours. Authoritarianism has corrupted public life, enriched business elites, entrenched the suppression of free speech, spawned a ruthless, unaccountable security-service apparatus and led to unspeakable abuses of human rights.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The weight, some shrug, of centuries of strongman rule&#8212;who cares? For much of modern history Central Asia has been of no consequence. Flourishing Silk Road links were severed when the Ming dynasty ceased trading. The Soviet Union replaced Central Asia&#8217;s petty despotisms with one big one, and when that empire collapsed the newly independent borderland states seemed not so much &#8220;Central&#8221; as peripheral in every way. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet Central Asia is now moving closer to centre-stage. For one thing, not only America but also Russia and China view the region as a bulwark against militant Islam. More salient, perhaps, in a world mad for mineral resources, Central Asia seems to have plenty, especially oil, gas and gold. So a third, related trend is that the East Asian miracle centred on China is fast reshaping the continental Asian land mass. Late last year three Central Asian leaders plus China&#8217;s president, Hu Jintao, gathered to open the spigot of a 7,000km (4,400-mile) pipeline taking gas from Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Networks of roads and new railways are being planned and built, drawing Central Asia into the continent&#8217;s bigger economic story&#8212;a new Silk Road.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Europeans have tried vainly to exert some influence over the region. In 2003 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development held its annual meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan&#8217;s capital. But the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which houses the most fervent advocates of a joined-up Asia, seems to be winning the battle. Earlier this month it held its annual get-together in Tashkent (it was boycotted by NGOs because of Uzbekistan&#8217;s human-rights record). The ADB&#8217;s Central Asian Regional Economic Co-operation (CAREC) initiative aims to tie Central Asian states more closely to each other and with the rest of Asia. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Central Asia, then, is turning east. Its trade with China has jumped 50-fold since 1990. In Uzbekistan the South Korean presence is the most striking. At Tashkent airport flights from Seoul disgorge the white-shirted shock troops of South Korea&#8217;s electronics giants and resource companies. Korean Air has plans to build and run a huge transport hub in nearby Navoi. Diplomats in Tashkent say that the country&#8217;s beloved Mr Karimov is obsessed by Korea. He likes its cleanliness and order (Uzbek officials harp on Tashkent&#8217;s neatness). The model of authoritarian rule that accompanied government-led development in 1960s South Korea pushes all the right buttons for Mr Karimov. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The question now is whether Central Asia might follow South Korea&#8217;s hopeful trajectory towards not just a prosperous market economy, but also a plural politics. Mr Karimov&#8217;s support for the form of multiparty democracy implies he believes it should&#8212;though not, presumably, till after he is gone. Even then the odds look stacked against it. Expect no pressure from fellow Asians&#8212;regional custom militates against telling tyrants that they stink. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet Mr Karimov and others seem fundamentally to misunderstand the Korean model. Although government resources were channelled to favoured companies, these firms then had fiercely to compete among themselves and on world markets. In Central Asia the most successful companies are sinecures of nepotism.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What is more, South Korea&#8217;s transition to liberal democracy entailed grassroots activism as well as top-down guidance. A raucous collection of citizens&#8217; groups unnerved the country&#8217;s dictators. In Uzbekistan, by contrast, what stunted opposition has dared to raise its head has been smashed by Mr Karimov. In 2005 his regime killed hundreds to suppress protests, and appears ready to do so again. He maintains strict control over politics, even to the point of demanding dissent. In a bizarre scene at the opening of the new, rigged parliament in January, he called for a clash of ideas and scolded parliamentarians for their monotonous praise of his and the country&#8217;s achievements.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Lessons from Bishkek</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A last reason for thinking the odds are stacked against change is the regional reaction to events in Kyrgyzstan. In Tashkent officials say the chaos only underscores the need for a strongman rule. And in Kazakhstan on May 13th parliament approved constitutional amendments granting Mr Nazarbayev the status of &#8220;leader of the nation&#8221;, giving him the say over all policy moves, even after he leaves office. China too is attempting to draw lessons from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s turmoil. Chinese academics say one direct consequence has been a crackdown on NGOs. Stability is all. But another lesson from Kyrgyzstan is that corrupt, paternalist rule, with a strongly ex-Soviet mindset, is the very worst way to deliver it, in the long run and possibly even the short. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Can Palestinians peacefully build a state?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Their prime minister, Salam Fayyad (pictured), is giving it a go. But he is caught between his own people&#8217;s demands and those of Israel</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BEIT OMAR | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A PORTLY official from the office of the Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, planted a kiss on Musa Abu Mariya&#8217;s right eye, enveloped him in a bear hug and sped off in his sport utility vehicle trailing a cloud of dust. Mr Abu Mariya organises protests in Beit Omar, a town on the West Bank, against Israel&#8217;s appropriation of land for settlements and security walls that can cut through Palestinian farms and hurt the villagers&#8217; livelihood. As official visits go, it was better than most. But the kiss left Mr Abu Mariya squirming. These days he no longer knows whether the pre-dawn knock on his door heralds Israeli or Palestinian security men. In recent weeks, both have hauled him off to their prisons. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Palestinian official&#8217;s visit illustrates the dilemma faced by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Mr Fayyad. Publicly, the PA celebrates Mr Abu Mariya&#8217;s peaceful protests beneath Israel&#8217;s concrete watch-towers. His sit-downs in Beit Omar, on the main road that Jewish settlers use between Jerusalem and Hebron, the biggest Palestinian city in the southern part of the West Bank, chime with the PA&#8217;s own boycott of anything to do with the settlements. The PA recently gave the 25,000-odd Palestinians who work in them until the end of the year to give up their jobs or face up to five years in jail. And both the protesters and the PA share the common aim of ending the occupation in the 80% of the West Bank, known as Areas B and C, that are controlled directly by the Israeli army. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the increasingly vocal protests by Mr Abu Mariya and others like him are disturbing the quiet that the PA has preserved since Israel crushed the Palestinians&#8217; second <em>intifada </em>(uprising) some four years ago and that has given Mr Fayyad the space to start building a state from the bottom up. While the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, looks to American-mediated negotiations, which have just resumed indirectly, to bring about a future Palestinian state, Mr Fayyad has used the calm to try to resuscitate the economy and train security forces. Should protests, now concentrated in the rural parts of the West Bank and numbering around 40 a week, turn violent, Israel may once again feel obliged to rumble in and upset the PA&#8217;s plans. &#8220;Things are happening outside the cities beyond our control,&#8221; says a PA security official. &#8220;You can ride the tiger, but you have no idea where it is heading.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Through kisses and harsher means, the Palestinian Authority is seeking to tame the protesters. Mr Fayyad, a former World Bank man admired by many Western leaders, has fronted rallies and at public bonfires symbolically burned products made by Israeli settlers. With foreign diplomats in tow, he recently went to Bilin, a village famous for its protests, and opened a conference for &#8220;Palestinian popular resistance&#8221;. He has even appointed a minister for the Annexation Wall and Settlements with a $63m budget to oversee his own protest committees. This week the minister, Maher Ghnemi, hosted Mr Abu Mariya and other protest leaders in Ramallah.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But to Israeli military men who run Areas B and C, Mr Fayyad&#8217;s actions risk stoking another <em>intifada</em>. To Mr Abu Mariya, they look like a veiled bid by Mr Fayyad to gain control of an independent grassroots movement and to turn the drive for a Palestinian state into a cause without rebels. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In cities such as Nablus, the biggest in the northern bit of the West Bank and the hub of the second <em>intifada</em>, that mission seems largely accomplished. The city&#8217;s billboards, once covered in portraits of &#8220;martyred&#8221; fighters, including suicide-bombers, now sport advertisements for fancy shops. As the influence of Islamist radicals wanes, more girls have shed their veils. Earlier this year, Nablus police made their first arrest for drunken-driving since the <em>intifada</em>.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But in the hills outside the cities, where Israel still rules, Palestinian anger against the impotence of their own authorities is still fierce. &#8220;No one from the PA comes to help us,&#8221; complains Azmi Shweikhi, who has the misfortune to live just below a Jewish settlement run by Baruch Marzel, a far-right zealot who, he says, empties his rubbish on his Palestinian neighbour below and is blamed for sawing down the olive trees on his terrace. To add to Mr Shweikhi&#8217;s misery, Israel&#8217;s authorities recently gave him an eviction order.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Abu Mariya admits to tapping into such discontent but rejects accusations that he is travelling down a slippery slope towards violence. Campaigners, he says, have learnt from the experience of the second <em>intifada </em>that they are outgunned. Non-violent protest is more effective, though some of his followers make an exception for throwing stones in return for soldiers&#8217; gunfire. Though not yet a mass movement, Mr Abu Mariya has mobilised unarmed female, international and Israeli sympathisers, including his wife, a Jewish-American. Each week, across the West Bank, they brave soldiers&#8217; tear-gas, rubber-coated bullets and beatings-up. Last year 145 people, including 62 Israeli and Palestinian security people, were injured in demonstrations, 40% more than in 2008. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Political opponents of Mr Fayyad, a technocrat who has sought to avoid being tagged with any particular label, have also jumped on the protesters&#8217; bandwagon. Those in the secular Fatah party, which has been largely excluded from Mr Fayyad&#8217;s government in the West Bank (and from that of the Islamist movement, Hamas, in the Gaza Strip), have taken to flag-waving at demonstrations to remind people that they are still there. Hamas, which denounces both negotiations and Mr Fayyad&#8217;s state-building project and has, as a result, been virtually banned from political activity in the West Bank, is also looking for ways of expressing itself. Beit Omar&#8217;s former mayor, a Hamas man who was sacked by Mr Fayyad, walks at the front of the town&#8217;s marches, arm-in-arm with left-wing Israelis. &#8220;Popular resistance is the right way to resist the occupation,&#8221; says Mahmoud Ramahi, a senior Hamas member of the Palestinian parliament.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bolstered by people power, such protests have had an effect. In Bilin, Budrus and other spots along Israel&#8217;s barrier that takes bites out of Palestinian territory in the West Bank, they may have helped persuade Israel&#8217;s courts to push the West Bank barrier closer to the boundary that existed before the war of 1967. &#8220;Weakness is our strength,&#8221; says Mr Abu Mariya. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, that may not work much longer. In addition to Israeli gunfire and tear-gas, PA security men in plain clothes have begun to infiltrate the ranks of the protesters to spot people who might want a third <em>intifada</em>. Some suspect that, as well as suppressing Hamas, Mr Fayyad&#8217;s forces also want to prove their effectiveness and thus gain Israel&#8217;s trust. In a few places Israel&#8217;s army has already expanded the territory where PA security forces can operate outside the cities to which the Oslo Accords of 1993 had confined them, particularly around Hebron. Israel has also hinted that as reward for the current proximity talks more territorial extensions could be in the offing. But the protesters complain that Mr Fayyad&#8217;s men are doing the occupier&#8217;s dirty work. Worryingly for Mr Abu Mariya, Israel&#8217;s military authorities are even considering a PA request to build a police station in Beit Omar.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Israel benefits as well as the PA. After all, the fiercest challenges to its rule have been in the villages of the West Bank and in East Jerusalem, all places that have been under Israel&#8217;s military control. Israel would be only too happy to let Mr Fayyad&#8217;s men rid them of havens for Hamas and car thieves. But not all Israel&#8217;s soldiers feel so comfortable about helping the PA extend its control. They often make sure the Palestinians, whoever they are, know who is in charge, sometimes by patrolling around the PA&#8217;s seat of government in Ramallah. After the fat PA official had delivered his message to the gaunt Mr Abu Mariya, gently requesting good behaviour, he too found his exit blocked by Israeli soldiers, who had put boulders at the entrance to Beit Omar. With or without their good behaviour, the Palestinians still have a long way to go before they build a state. But Mr Fayyad has made a fair start. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>As potent as ever</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Iraq&#8217;s tribes may hold the balance of power</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | ABU GHRAIB | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE big maps on the walls of the sprawling American base known as Camp Victory, next to Baghdad&#8217;s main airport, show Iraq as a country divided into parts more or less dominated by either Sunni or Shia Muslims. But when the camp&#8217;s uniformed occupants, many on a third or fourth tour of duty there, discuss their dealings with the country&#8217;s leaders, the word that dominates their talk is tribe.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More than a hundred are spread across Iraq, some with a quarter of a million members, many of them cutting across sectarian lines. Local politics has been run mainly by tribal leaders ever since they wrested control of vast stretches of land from insurgent groups two or three years ago, bringing a measure of calm to Iraq. For the first time, therefore, the tribes command the national stage. With the main political parties deadlocked after an inconclusive election, the tribes are courted as potential allies by leaders on all sides, and could act as one of several kingmakers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The tribes have been transformed from gun-toting bands of desert warriors into well-oiled political machines. Many of their leaders have gained clout by funnelling government contracts to companies tied to them, dispensing justice in tribal courts that are a bit less prone to bribery than state equivalents, supervising recruitment to the civil service and armed forces, and&#8212;perhaps most of all&#8212;controlling blocks of votes by invoking ancient tribal loyalties.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The election on March 7th confirmed their rise, especially in northern Iraq. A tribal block led by Sheikh Abdullah Humedi won control of Nineveh, Iraq&#8217;s second most populous province, with the city of Mosul at its hub, while an alliance led by the Jubburi tribe won half the seats in the disputed oil-rich city of Kirkuk. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tribal leaders in Iraq&#8217;s largest province, Anbar, west of Baghdad, which is overwhelmingly Sunni, outmanoeuvred one of their own who had aspirations for national office, Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha. Instead they adeptly swung the province behind Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia, helping to secure him the biggest share of the national vote. Yet, to break the logjam in the new parliament, whose members are struggling to cobble together a governing coalition, they may soon drop Mr Allawi as well. One sheikh, Hamid al-Hais, has already done so. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the words of a noted Iraqi academic, the tribal leaders are &#8220;the ultimate pragmatists&#8221;. They won concessions from Saddam Hussein. In earlier days they did the same with the ruling Ottoman Turks. In between, they cut deals with the British. These days what the modern tribes want varies widely. Some expect government jobs and cash for infrastructure projects. Other want more autonomy, and perhaps even a tribal council that functions as an upper house of parliament. That idea dismays some of the urban professional politicians but others might support it as part of a wider constitutional reform to limit the powers of the prime minister. Party barons particularly dislike the tight grip of the incumbent, Nuri al-Maliki, who is determined to make deals to cling to power, despite his narrow defeat at the polls. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The overall influence of the tribes is uncertain. They could be a force for cross-sectarian reconciliation, since many of the big tribal confederations, such as the Shammar, straddle the Sunni-Shia divide. Or they could disrupt Iraqi politics still more with their demands for special favours entrenching an already malign system of patronage and corruption. Iraq has existed as a country for less than a century. The bonds holding it together have frayed. Some kind of constitutional equilibrium is sorely needed. But if that fails to come about, pessimists see the country turning into a kind of Somalia with oil, an anarchic collection of wealthy competing fiefs, with tribes to the fore. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h2>The results are not in doubt, only the prospects of millions of impoverished and hungry Ethiopians</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | ADDIS ABABA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PRESIDENT Meles Zenawi and his ruling Ethiopian People&#8217;s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) expect a landslide victory in the general election due on May 23rd, and are likely to get one. The bigger question is whether another five years of EPRDF rule will help ordinary Ethiopians, who are among the poorest and hungriest people in the world. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The austere and cerebral Mr Zenawi has ruled the country since 1991, when he led his Marxist guerrillas to overthrow a brutish dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam. Mr Zenawi remains wedded to what he calls &#8220;revolutionary democracy&#8221;, which emphasises collective will over individual ambition. He contends that a strong hand and development in the villages&#8212;rather than liberalising markets&#8212;is the way forward. And after a worryingly good show by the opposition in the last election in 2005, after which about 200 civilian protesters were gunned down by the police, it is the strong hand that has been much in evidence in the run-up to these elections. Press freedom, as well as the activities of some opposition parties and human-rights NGOs, have been curtailed to ensure a smoother ride for Mr Zenawi. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The EPRDF made much in the election campaign of the country&#8217;s high levels of economic growth, averaging 8% or so a year. But that hides the puniness of the economy. Exports of $1.4 billion in the past financial year compare to $5 billion in neighbouring Kenya, which has half of Ethiopia&#8217;s population. Construction has boomed, but manufacturing continues to falter. Ethiopia has a cheap and disciplined workforce, but not the mulch of managers, accountants and commercial lawyers that investors want to see, and which they can find plentifully elsewhere in Africa.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government&#8217;s instinct for centralised control continues to inhibit enterprise and depress growth. Ethiopia&#8217;s state-run banks are dwarfed by private-sector banks elsewhere in Africa. Mr Zenawi claims that communications are paramount, but his government has stymied the mobile-phone revolution for its own political ends. Elsewhere in Africa, the debate is about the relative merits of Blackberries and iPhones. In Ethiopia, it is simply about getting a phone. Equally devastating is state control of the internet. Connection is costly and slow. The official in charge of the internet at the state telecoms outfit appears to be a high-ranking secret-service officer. That is to combat hackers, say flustered EPRDF officials. More likely, he is employed to spy on citizens and block websites the government does not like&#8212;which include most produced by the Ethiopian diaspora.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The EPRDF counters criticism by saying it has held the country together against subversives. &#8220;Separatist attitudes are waning,&#8221; insists the information minister, Bereket Simon, referring to the rebellious Ogaden and Oromo regions. He adds that much of the opposition has &#8220;links to the Shabab [the Somali al-Qaeda group] and Eritrea&#8221;, but that is delusional. In fact, the opposition is more nationalistic than the EPRDF, and some, particularly from the important Amhara region, would like to drive Eritrea into the sea. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More reasonably, the government can point to road building and rural electrification initiatives. The massive increase in schools and clinics in villages is impressive. Regional governments have more autonomy and mobilise more money and support than ever before. Some progress has been made in diversifying the economy. Coffee growers earn more thanks to better branding and smarter co-operatives and a flower industry has opened up. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet party and state interests are too often muddled, with benefits denied to citizens who question the EPRDF. Many of those with the skills and creative thinking needed to help Ethiopia face up to its considerable problems are excluded from the political process. That includes journalists. Take Eskinder Nega. At the last election in 2005, he ran three Amharic language newspapers with his wife. Following the election violence, in which the EPRDF was implicated, Mr Nega and his wife were arrested on treason charges. Their son was born in prison. They have been pardoned, but continue to be harassed. A court has ruled out a relaunch of Mr Nega&#8217;s papers. &#8220;I am living proof this election is not free and fair,&#8221; he says, &#8220;if it was I would still be publishing&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ethiopia will probably remain one of the biggest recipients of Western aid over the next five years. The EPRDF may be authoritarian, but many think it is the best bet for cutting poverty at home and checking jihadists in Somalia. That may be ill-judged, and not just on moral grounds. Western money does not buy the leverage it used to. China is lending Ethiopia billions of dollars; $460m alone to build a controversial dam on the Omo river. Faced with the prospect of more nagging from the West about human rights and opening up the economy, Mr Zenawi can just choose the Chinese way. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>SEARCHING desperately for her son, Mehdi, who has disappeared in the mayhem of protest after Iran&#8217;s disputed election last June, a woman pleads with a guard outside the notorious Evin prison in Tehran, Iran&#8217;s capital. &#8220;I have no one else to turn to. You can help me find him,&#8221; she begs. Lowering over her, he refuses to help. As she continues her search, the woman, Zahra, pictures the hopeful sea of protesters that swamped the streets of Tehran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#8217;s declared victory. But she remembers too with horror the death of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian journalist who died in 2003 after a beating in the same prison.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The scenes are from &#8220;Zahra&#8217;s Paradise&#8221;, an online graphic novel written and illustrated by two Iranians in America. The authors are anonymous, fearing what could happen to relatives still in Iran. The novel, published three times a week, tells in stark black-and-white pictures the story of Iran&#8217;s protesters and the horrors they have endured since the election. Tens of thousands of readers scattered all over the world follow each instalment in languages from Persian and Arabic to Dutch and Korean. When the story is finished, the authors plan to release it as a book.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The title, &#8220;Zahra&#8217;s Paradise&#8221;, has particular resonance for Iranians. It is the name of a sprawling cemetery in southern Tehran. Over the years, many of the Islamic Republic&#8217;s victims have ended up there, the graves so numerous they can be found only by using plot numbers. Iranians of all kinds, from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the Iranian revolution, to Neda Agha Soltan, a student who was photographed as she was shot dead during one of the protests, are interred there. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The story of a mother searching for her child will be familiar to many in Iran. Hundreds of protesters are still missing after the past year&#8217;s demonstrations. A group of women, called Mothers in Mourning, still meet each week in Tehran&#8217;s parks to remember them and to call for the release of those behind bars.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Another round for Africa's Iron Lady</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A woman&#8217;s work is never done</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | MONROVIA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was elected president of Liberia in 2005, she promised to step down as head of state after one six-year term. Now, however, the 71-year-old former World Bank director, the only woman ever elected to head an African state, says she needs another term to complete what she has started. Though Ms Sirleaf is favourite to win next year&#8217;s election, she will not have it all her own way in this small west African country, the continent&#8217;s oldest republic.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;One of the reasons why I decided to run again&#8221;, she says, &#8220;is because we have laid the foundations in terms of our reform agenda but only now are we at the point where we are poised to take corrective measures.&#8221; Top of that agenda is corruption. Despite having declared &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; at the beginning of her term, it is still a huge problem&#8212;and her own government is not immune. This year she has had to sack her information minister for pocketing the salaries of fictitious employees. And she has had to force her brother, accused of embezzlement, to stand down as internal-affairs minister. Five ministries, including those of finance and mines, have come under fire from the country&#8217;s auditor-general, who published a string of reports showing that millions of dollars are unaccounted for. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;There are some merits in the public characterisation that not enough is being done on corruption,&#8221; says Frances Johnson Morris, Liberia&#8217;s anti-corruption commissioner, cagily. The president, who earned the sobriquet &#8220;Iron Lady&#8221; in the hard years of opposition, agrees. She says she could not afford to annoy an unco-operative legislature with a crusade on corruption while trying to persuade it to pass crucial economic reforms. So she promises to do better in a second term. &#8220;I did not realise the problem of corruption was so deep,&#8221; she concedes. &#8220;It is societal, it is not just a problem with government, it is all over.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But though Liberia&#8217;s stability is fragile and 8,000 UN troops are still in the country, it is a much better place than it was a few years ago. Rebels and teenage soldiers then loyal to a warlord-turned-president, Charles Taylor, now on trial for war crimes at The Hague, used to rampage through the capital, Monrovia, killing with impunity. An on-off civil war between 1989 and 2003 left about 250,000 dead.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> By contrast, Ms Sirleaf has increased the national budget from a mere $80m in 2006 to $350m today and persuaded the IMF to clear the last of Liberia&#8217;s $4.9 billion external debt. Monrovia is witnessing a building boom, with beachside resorts and blocks of flats springing up, along with some conspicuously grand mansions belonging to well-known politicians. Ms Sirleaf has also freed Liberia&#8217;s forestry and diamond sectors from UN sanctions and renegotiated a controversial contract with a steel giant, ArcelorMittal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This should please some voters. A recent merger of Ms Sirleaf&#8217;s Unity Party with two opposition parties should also consolidate support, especially among the elite of American-Liberian families who came to the country as freed slaves in the 19th century and have dominated the economy ever since. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But her opponents in next year&#8217;s poll may accuse her of pandering to the old elite. In 2005 she almost lost to a footballer and political novice, George Weah, who ran as a populist. To make matters worse, Liberia&#8217;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has listed Ms Sirleaf, along with some of her past and present allies, as partly to blame for Liberia&#8217;s 14-year-long civil war. In particular, it cited her for backing Mr Taylor when he was a rebel who overthrew the military dictatorship of Samuel Doe. Ms Sirleaf has publicly regretted her past association with Mr Taylor. Nonetheless, the commission said she should be banned from public office. That recommendation is unlikely to be taken up by the legislature, but it will still tarnish her reputation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the spectrum of Liberian politics, Ms Sirleaf is arguably the best president the country has ever had. But that does not mean the voters are bound to agree. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Marching through Red Square</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A pragmatic new foreign policy may be a plus, but it does not mean that Russia is ready to make any changes at home</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ON MAY 9th soldiers from NATO countries, including America, Britain and Poland, marched across Red Square in Russia&#8217;s Victory Day parade. Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Ode to Joy&#8221;, the anthem of the European Union, was played along with the Soviet-era national anthem. Military parades are symbolic and the Kremlin has long put Russia&#8217;s wartime victory at the centre of its post-Soviet identity. But this parade was meant to project the image of a self-confident, powerful country seeking better relations with the West.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A year ago it symbolised Russia&#8217;s victory over Georgia and its American backers. These days Dmitry Rogozin, Russia&#8217;s ambassador to NATO, talks of common values and the trustworthiness of America. And Radek Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, praises the openness of the Kremlin in investigating the Smolensk air crash and says Poland is an ally. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Russia&#8217;s foreign policy has changed&#8212;and the change goes beyond rhetoric. After 40 years of tedious talks, Russia has signed a maritime border agreement with Norway. It is using soft power in Ukraine. Perhaps most significant is the improvement in relations with Poland, a centuries-old irritant. After years of exploiting differences between old and new members of the European Union, Vladimir Putin, Russia&#8217;s prime minister, has realised that EU solidarity is more than mere rhetoric.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Germany&#8217;s Angela Merkel made clear two years ago that, if Russia wanted better relations with the EU, it had to mend fences with Poland. That required a shift in the Kremlin&#8217;s historical discourse and its taste for Stalin. Mr Putin has been remarkably flexible. Last year he went to Gdansk to mark the start of the war; this year he knelt to commemorate victims of the Katyn massacre ordered by Stalin in 1940. The importance of Poland in the Kremlin&#8217;s eyes has grown along with the prospects of shale gas in the country. Gazprom is now said to be sweet-talking the Poles into a long-term gas contract. In the contest between gas interests and Stalin, Stalin loses.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is no point sulking or being belligerent with the West, the Kremlin seems to have decided. As Mr Putin has said, Russia should present a smiling face to the world. A smile, however, does not alter nature; the Russian shift has occurred without significant change inside the country. Russia has not become less corrupt or more democratic. Russian troops remain in part of Georgia; Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former Yukos boss, is still in jail. Russia has not abandoned its claim to a privileged interest in the neighbourhood.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dmitry Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre, argues that Russian foreign policy under Mr Putin has always been more defensive than offensive. It is shaped more by vested financial and political interests than by ideology or geopolitics. Russia&#8217;s return to business as usual was made easier by Barack Obama&#8217;s reset policy (seen in Moscow as an admission of past mistakes) and the shelving of NATO expansion. The financial crisis has also shown up Russia&#8217;s vulnerability. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After a decade of rising oil prices and budget surpluses, Russia is running a deficit and looking to borrow money. The crisis has exploded a model of economic growth that relied on rising oil and gas prices. To keep its grip on power, the Kremlin has now come up with a different idea: modernisation to renew the Russian economy without changing its political system.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Russia&#8217;s new pragmatism is set out in a leaked foreign-ministry paper. The document is not an example of liberalism and openness, but it argues that Russia must form modernisation alliances with leading countries and attract Western technologies while advancing the interests of Russian companies abroad. In a sign of desperation, even Armenia is seen as a channel for the transfer of technology to Russia. Russia&#8217;s wish list includes visa-free travel, the adoption of EU standards and membership of the World Trade Organisation and the OECD rich-country club.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The EU&#8217;s attitude has been cautious and more realistic than many suppose. Progress in EU-Russia relations has been painfully slow. Barring a few appeasers, most governments in Europe, including Germany&#8217;s, have no illusions left about Mr Putin&#8217;s Russia: its weak property rights, high corruption and the symbiosis of state power with private financial interests. Yet most EU governments also embrace the idea of modernisation. A large emerging market with a huge demand for technological catch-up serves the interests of European companies. Adopting EU standards would also curb Russia&#8217;s ability to impose arbitrary trade sanctions. And many see Russia&#8217;s slogan of modernisation as a chance, however feeble, to push for its political transformation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Talk of modernisation has not removed basic disagreements. Mr Medvedev&#8217;s November proposal for a new European security treaty focuses on hard power and implies a veto on NATO expansion which is unpalatable to the West. It is being discussed as part of the so-called Corfu process, but one European politician likens it to a <em>perpetuum mobile</em> that will go on forever without reaching a conclusion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From Russia&#8217;s viewpoint, Mr Medvedev&#8217;s scheme has helped to divert attention from Georgia. &#8220;[They] stopped discussing Georgia and started discussing this proposal,&#8221; Mr Rogozin says. Russia has kept its military presence not just in Georgia but in other former Soviet republics. It has just agreed an extension of the Black Sea fleet&#8217;s lease in Sebastopol, in Ukraine.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As the foreign-ministry document asserts, Russia needs to consolidate the former Soviet space by, for example, pushing the customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Brussels has warned Ukraine that, were it to join this customs union, it would jeopardise its partnership with the EU. Russia itself sees the EU as a source of innovation, but not a model for democracy. Talk of common values and the rule of law causes heartburn among such Russian officials as Vladimir Chizhov, a smiling and impenetrable ambassador to the EU. Asked what Russia wants from the EU, he starts with what it does not want: to have it as a bossy patron come to modernise Russia. &#8220;We see it as a purely utilitarian initiative,&#8221; he says.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The main problem is not that Russia defends its own values (it has few) but that its leaders think the values gap does not exist and the West is hypocritical to talk of it. Unlike Mikhail Gorbachev&#8217;s policy of openness, which was inseparable from domestic liberalisation, Russia&#8217;s new d\xE9tente implies no political change at home. The foreign-ministry document talks of the need to project the image of Russia as a democratic state with a socially oriented market economy&#8212;but says nothing about the need actually to become one. Russia&#8217;s rapprochement is fragile since it hinges on an idea of modernisation that is unlikely to succeed without liberalisation. The risk is that when modernisation fails, Russia will blame the West for sabotaging it. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Czechs are fed up with corrupt politics. What next?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | PRAGUE | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>MANY Czechs would like to see the incumbent prime minister, Jan Fischer, a former chief statistician who has served as caretaker for the past year, continue in the job. However, he is not contesting the election on May 28th and 29th; and the corruption and squabbling of the political class moves Czechs to a sort of languid despair.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of the country&#8217;s best-known intellectuals and cultural figures are backing a non-party movement called <em>Vymente Politiky</em> (&#8220;Replace the Politicians&#8221;) that wants a wholesale clean-out. Among its supporters is Marta Kubisova, a much-loved singer who was forced into menial work after the Soviet-led invasion of 1968. When she sang her banned protest song &#8220;A Prayer for Marta&#8221; to tearful, cheering demonstrators in Prague in 1989, it was a death-knell for communism. The group&#8217;s website has a video of her saying &#8220;For the last four years it seemed to me that I live in a madhouse.&#8221; Another initiative is called bluntly &#8220;Defenestration 2010&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Several new parties are trying to capitalise on discontent with the main parties. TOP 09 is a conservative, free-market grouping led by Karel Schwarzenberg, an aristocrat exiled in communist times who became a popular foreign minister. Critics say other figures in his party lack his squeaky-clean pedigree. Its most controversial tactic has been to send voters dummy invoices showing the level of the country&#8217;s debt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A more populist outfit is Public Matters, led by Radek John, an investigative journalist who shuns suits and peppers his stump speeches with expletives. As well as a motley mix of policies, the party has deployed volunteer patrols in Prague that dispensed advice to citizens but also shooed away homeless people and drug addicts. It stopped this in mid-May, but Mr John is now the country&#8217;s most popular politician, ahead of Mr Schwarzenberg. Both men&#8217;s parties are polling over 10%; each could play a role in forming a new coalition.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As in previous elections, voters divide evenly between right and left, making another weak, squabbling government consisting of one big party and some smaller fry all too likely. Another possible result is a minority Social Democrat government that depends on backing from the unrepentant Czech Communist Party. Or there could be a grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Civic Democrats. Such a cosy carve-up might suit insiders, but it would surely swell Ms Kubisova&#8217;s chorus.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The opposition is in a shambles ahead of Slovakia&#8217;s election on June 12th</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BRATISLAVA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SLOVAKIA&#8217;S centre-right politicians used to be both popular and prominent, feted in Brussels and Washington for their bold reforms. Before they took over, the country was run by a populist, Vladimir Meciar, whose misrule led Madeleine Albright, America&#8217;s then secretary of state, to call Slovakia a black hole in 1997. Only six years later, in 2003, the World Bank cited it as a top reformer. But voters soon tired of upheaval and a growing sense of sleaze. The centre-right government of Mikulas Dzurinda narrowly lost office in 2006. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Its bequest of competitiveness and credibility lasted for two years, during which Slovakia had rapid growth and low inflation, stoked by foreign investment and an export boom. It joined the euro in 2009. But the economy shrank by 4.7% last year, and the budget deficit is expected to be 7% of GDP in 2010. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the economy&#8217;s troubles have not helped the centre-right. Three weeks ahead of Slovakia&#8217;s election on June 12th, the polls give the incumbent prime minister, Robert Fico, and his Smer-SD (Direction-Social Democracy) party an unassailable 36%. Mr Dzurinda&#8217;s brand of Christian Democrats, the SDKU, is trailing with only 13%. Mr Fico has derailed the SDKU with revelations about dodgy-seeming party financing during its days in government. Critics say he is diverting attention from questionable dealings involving his own government, many of which involve his embarrassing coalition partner, the racist Slovak National Party (SNS).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Dzurinda has pulled out of the campaign and the SDKU has floundered. Its leader, Iveta Radicova, has used the title of her book &#8220;With People, and For The People&#8221; as a campaign slogan. Mr Fico gleefully pointed out that it was also used by the unreconstructed Czech Communist Party. Populist SDKU tactics, such as denouncing the rescue plans for Greece and the euro, have failed to win it support.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That has created room for rivals on the centre-right. Led by a former European commissioner, Jan Figel, another lot of Christian Democrats (KDH) focus on the rule of law and the fight against crime. After government attacks on the courts&#8217; independence that left the judiciary in turmoil, this is a hot topic. The mastermind of Slovakia&#8217;s flat tax, Richard Sulik, has launched a new free-market party, Freedom and Solidarity. It is fighting the election on Facebook and Twitter and has a poll rating of around 11%. A third novice, Most-Hid, combines the Slovak and Hungarian words for &#8220;bridge&#8221; and is led by Bela Bugar, who came from the main ethnic Hungarian party. Its aim is to bridge the divide between the country&#8217;s majority Slavs and its 10% Hungarian-speaking minority. At 5.5%, it may just squeak into parliament. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One of these new entrants may one day gain power. But the question for this election will be which party the tough Mr Fico chooses as coalition partner in a government he seems all but sure to head.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The government is not being serious enough about cutting the budget deficit</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SO FAR, France&#8217;s creditworthiness has not come under as much scrutiny as that of other euro members. French bonds trade at a small premium to German ones. The (French) IMF head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has said &#8220;there is no real risk for France, nor for Germany.&#8221; Yet in reality France&#8217;s public finances are closer to Greece&#8217;s than to Germany&#8217;s. And rating agencies are watching pension reform for evidence of political will to get a grip. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The economy has weathered the recession quite well, enjoying four quarters in a row of (albeit weak) GDP growth. But the recession has battered the public finances. The budget deficit will be 8% of GDP this year, up from 3.3% in 2008. Although less dreadful than Spain and Greece, this is much worse than Germany (see chart). France&#8217;s public debt is expected to hit 84% of GDP in 2010&#8212;nowhere near Greece&#8217;s but higher than Germany&#8217;s and Spain&#8217;s.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy has trimmed spending, notably by not replacing one in two retiring civil servants. But there is no mention of pay freezes, let alone cuts; and talk of <em>rigueur</em> (austerity) remains taboo. France is betting on GDP growth, which it thinks will reach 2.5% from 2011, to get the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2013. The European Commission has already said this is wildly optimistic, noting &#8220;substantial risks&#8221; that the deficit in 2011-13 will be worse than forecast. The commission says debt could hit 95% of GDP by 2020.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No French government has balanced its budget in 30 years. There have been plenty of dire warnings, and not just from outsiders. In &#8220;Our Children Will Hate Us&#8221;, two French authors deplored the debt that the older generation has piled up for its offspring. A 2005 government-commissioned report by Michel P\xE9bereau caused a stir with its shock forecasts of swelling debt, but it was quickly forgotten.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>France badly needs to show it can stick to its word. This is why Mr Sarkozy&#8217;s pension reform, which he wants to push through by the autumn, is critical. The retirement age is only 60, next to 65 in Germany. Generous pensions (civil servants get 75% of their final six-months&#8217; salary) are mainly paid for by current workers. The average Frenchman spends 24 years in retirement, against an OECD average of 18 years. The upshot is a pension deficit that, even on official forecasts, could reach &#8364;35 billion by 2030. Even if France raises its retirement age to 63, it will only halve that shortfall. One government insider says 65 is the only serious option.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the government has now made underwhelming proposals, with only a vague reference to &#8220;lengthening working life&#8221; and no cuts in retirement benefits. It proposes instead an extra tax on high-earners and &#8220;financial&#8221; income&#8212;just the sort of soak-the-rich policy that Mr Sarkozy once eschewed. Even this plan has met with indignation. The opposition Socialists say they will resist any rise in the retirement age. &#8220;Workers are not responsible for the recession,&#8221; said Bernard Thibault, head of the Conf\xE9d\xE9ration G\xE9n\xE9rale du Travail, the biggest union. &#8220;Why should their pensions suffer the consequences?&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The unions plan a day of action on May 27th. The Greek crisis may help to focus minds. Some 63% of respondents to one French poll say France is the most exposed country to contagion from Greece, after Spain and Portugal. In another poll, 64% say the retirement age will have to rise. If public opinion does not support the unions, bolder measures might be possible. Yet the government, fearful of social unrest, is unwilling to push too hard. Judging by his unambitious plans, Mr Sarkozy seems more worried by hostility on the streets than by the bond markets. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Zapatero's cuts</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Spain&#8217;s prime minister reluctantly embraces fiscal austerity</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | MADRID | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS POLITICAL U-turns go, Jos\xE9 Luis Rodr\xEDguez Zapatero&#8217;s on May 12th was spectacular. Spain&#8217;s Socialist prime minister announced spending cuts of &#8364;15 billion ($18 billion) over two years. His vision of an expanding welfare state was dumped. With it may have gone Mr Zapatero&#8217;s political future. As he set out cuts in civil-service pay, social programmes and pensions, Mr Zapatero had the look of a man who has seen the writing on the wall. Yet his political death will take time. The next election is not due until 2012, and a fractious opposition seems unable to topple his minority government. He will call the shots for almost two more years. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Slicing the budget is a short-term fix that does nothing for growth. The budget deficit of around 10% of GDP is no longer cyclical; part has become structural. Mr Zapatero&#8217;s budget cuts will not take Spain out of crisis, says Pablo V\xE1zquez of the Foundation for the Study of Applied Economics. It is even more urgent to reform the labour market and pensions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Zapatero is skilled at sounding as if he means business, but his record is of painful slowness to deliver. Only a shove by the markets, the European Union or, on this occasion, America&#8217;s Barack Obama, can get him to act against his left-wing instincts. His May 12th plans, included a 5% cut in civil-service pay and the freezing of pensions next year, but he also wants higher taxes on the rich. He has made clear that the unpopular 2011 pensions freeze will not affect a top-up payment for this year&#8217;s inflation if it is over 1%. The cuts were welcomed by other euro-zone leaders anxious to avert a Spanish debt crisis. Spain&#8217;s economy, accounting for 12% of the euro zone, is four times as big as Greece&#8217;s. It is genuinely too big to fail.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Spain&#8217;s rigid labour market must be reformed to reduce unemployment of 20% and also to help those on temporary contracts. Negotiations with unions and employers are under way. It will take a short time to finish the job, Mr Zapatero said this week. Yet labour reform has been promised before. Pension reform, including a later retirement age proposed by Mr Zapatero four months ago, has drifted into the background. He shows no willingness to force reforms past the unions. He will do what he has to do, but always the minimum and without enthusiasm, says Jos\xE9 Luis \xC1lvarez, of the ESADE business school. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Zapatero&#8217;s presidential style of government is a problem. As ministers lose power, nobody is left to read him the riot act on the economy. It took not just Mr Obama but a series of late-night EU meetings to get him to face up to Spain&#8217;s fiscal hole. More pressure may be needed to keep him up to the mark. Most Spaniards will accept cuts because they like the EU and the euro. Yet prolonged austerity will drain Mr Zapatero&#8217;s support on the left. The unions plan strikes even though they have a more sympathetic ear in Mr Zapatero than in the right-wing People&#8217;s Party. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Before the cuts, Mr Zapatero&#8217;s Socialists were only 1.5 points behind the PP in the polls. Afterwards, the PP&#8217;s lead widened to nine points. The PP leader, Mariano Rajoy, has criticised the pension freeze. This may just be a cynical attempt to win votes. But the PP&#8217;s suggested alternative cuts could prove useful if Mr Zapatero has to keep slicing. They include reducing ministries and scrapping pork-barrel deals agreed with Basque nationalists. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The PP&#8217;s attacks contrast with the centre-right Social Democrats in Portugal, who firmly back the spending cuts and tax rise planned by the Socialist prime minister, Jos\xE9 S\xF3crates. And the Social Democrats are still ahead in the polls.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A never-ending fight</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The Turkish army continues its long battle with Kurdish rebels</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | KANDIL, NORTHERN IRAQ | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN TURKEY&#8217;S rugged south-east, giant portraits of Ataturk stare down from the mountains at rebellious Kurds. In the Kandil mountains, where the Iraqi and Iranian borders meet, images of Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers&#8217; Party (PKK), loom over land controlled by the rebels. The PKK has been ensconced here for over two decades. And Turkey&#8217;s army, NATO&#8217;s second-biggest, has been trying to dislodge it ever since.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over the past month clashes between the army and the PKK have escalated. Hundreds of Kurds have flocked to the conflict zone to become &#8220;human shields&#8221; for the rebels. In Turkey&#8217;s west, the rise in attempted mob lynchings by nationalist vigilantes is a worrying portent of more violence between ordinary Turks and Kurds.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The PKK is squeezed as never before. In November 2007, when Turkey threatened to invade the Kurdish-controlled enclave, the Americans agreed to let the Turks bomb Kandil and began sharing intelligence with them. Turkey has also mended fences with the Iraqi Kurds whose leader, Masoud Barzani, will soon visit Ankara. This follows a security pact signed in April between Turkey, America and Iraq. Alongside military measures, it takes aim at the PKK&#8217;s money, much of which is said to be raised through racketeering and drug trafficking (though the PKK denies this).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet Murat Karayilan, the PKK&#8217;s top commander in the field, boasts that &#8220;neither the most advanced technology nor the best equipped army can get us out of here.&#8221; A female PKK fighter called Gulistan says that &#8220;dying in our leader&#8217;s service would be the greatest honour of all.&#8221; A steady trickle of recruits suggests that her views are not uncommon.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Turkey&#8217;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, knows all this. His chief of the general staff, Ilker Basbug, has repeatedly said that firepower alone cannot vanquish the PKK. Mr Erdogan&#8217;s &#8220;Kurdish opening&#8221;, marked by the launch of Turkey&#8217;s first state-run Kurdish-language television channel last year, was a fresh effort to woo the Kurds. It was to have been crowned with a deal between the Iraqi Kurds and Mr Karayilan for the PKK to disarm and relocate its leaders elsewhere. Peace was within reach in October, when a batch of rebels from Kandil returned to Turkey and were released. But public fury mounted when rebels in guerrilla fatigues proceeded to declare &#8220;victory&#8221; at rallies across the south-east. A PKK attack in the province of Tokat that killed seven Turkish soldiers was the final straw. The Kurdish opening was put on hold.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Erdogan has since piled the blame on the PKK and on the largest Kurdish party, the BDP. Its refusal to support constitutional changes backed by Mr Erdogan is seen as proof of disloyalty. Yet many observers believe the Tokat attack was staged by PKK hardliners bent on sabotaging peace. This suggests that there are divisions among the rebels, a notion confirmed by Western intelligence sources. Mr Karayilan, who is seen as a moderate, predictably denies this. But he too is full of contradictions. He claims that a unilateral truce declared in April 2009 remains in force. But he also says the PKK has stepped up its attacks because &#8220;we remain under constant attack from the Turkish army. We are acting in self-defence.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BDP circles echo the PKK&#8217;s line that Mr Erdogan&#8217;s overtures were no more than window-dressing aimed at winning Kurdish votes in next year&#8217;s general election. Ordinary Kurds&#8217; support for the PKK may be fading, but they are also turning away from Mr Erdogan&#8217;s Justice and Development (AK) Party. And what about the mass arrests of 1,500 BDP officials, including elected mayors? Turkey insists that many were PKK operatives trying to establish &#8220;a parallel state&#8221; in the Kurdish region. Many are former PKK inmates. They say they want to pursue their cause through peaceful means but that the government won&#8217;t let them. Even some AK members privately agree that the arrests were a mistake.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Back in Kandil, Mr Karayilan ticks off the conditions of a new truce. &#8220;Mr Ocalan must be moved from solitary confinement to house arrest, Turkey must halt all military operations against my men and BDP officials have to be released unconditionally.&#8221; The subtext is that, like it or not, Turkey will have to sit down with the rebels. Maybe so, but with which lot? That may be the trickiest question of all.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Perfidious Albion again</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The British are different, really. But they are stuck with Europe&#8212;and it with them</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE British are unfit to join the common market because they differ &#8220;profoundly&#8221; from continental Europeans, Charles de Gaulle declared in 1963. Britain is &#8220;insular, maritime, and linked by her exchanges, her markets and her supply routes to the most diverse and often the farthest-flung nations.&#8221; Britain trades, it does not farm, the French president grumbled. Let them in, and the club will become a vast &#8220;Atlantic community&#8221;, ripe for American domination. In short, Non.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After a good dinner, a surprising number of European Union officials and politicians will murmur that de Gaulle was right: Britain should never have joined. Many British Eurosceptics would endorse his description of their country. They have a point: Britain is different. As the new prime minister, David Cameron, holds his first meetings with France&#8217;s Nicolas Sarkozy and Germany&#8217;s Angela Merkel, it is worth pondering why.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When Britain joined the then EEC in 1973, it was a club designed to meet purely continental goals such as containing Germany&#8217;s peaceful rise and modernising European farms. That template &#8220;poisoned the first years of British membership&#8221;, says one senior figure&#8212;think of Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s battle to get her money back. Britain emerged from economic misery in the 1970s via a brutal political adjustment, as the then Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher sought to curb militant trade unions and roll back the state. That felt like a British, not a European achievement. When other European leaders then began talking of a &#8220;social Europe&#8221; to protect workers, it sounded awfully like a return to pre-Thatcher days. In contrast, France&#8217;s post-war boom was a time of central planning, which cemented in place a certain faith in the state. In lots of countries voters now link joining the European project to emergence from dictatorship and economic isolation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Historians describe the English (more than the British) as unusually individualist and market-minded since medieval times, working for wages and trading property. England has had a central system of common law for centuries. It industrialised early. It has not been occupied in a long while. All this matters. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In much of Europe people look to the EU as a higher authority able to rescue them from dysfunctional local rulers, notes one ambassador. Britain, he says, is one of the few countries whose voters assume domestic administration is superior to the EU&#8217;s.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>De Gaulle was also right that the British have a different view of America. Take the arguments for building an expensive EU satellite navigation system, Galileo. Europe depends on America&#8217;s GPS system, it is said, so the Americans could veto an EU military mission. In much of Europe heads nod in agreement at this point. But the British struggle ever to imagine backing an EU military venture opposed by the Americans.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The British debate on Europe is also affected by a raucous popular press that lazily presents the EU as a nefarious plot to do the country down. National newspapers on the continent are overwhelmingly pro-establishment and therefore pro-EU. British newspapers may reflect a more Eurosceptic public opinion. But the savage competitiveness of their market also leads them into adopting more extreme positions. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The euro crisis exposes new differences. Britain decided to stand aloof from the bulk of the recent &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) euro-zone defence fund. But Sweden and Poland felt they had enough at stake to contribute. A disintegrating euro frightens all those with life savings in that currency, including officials and ministers at EU meetings. They found it humiliating when President Barack Obama publicly urged EU leaders to shore up the currency. Outside the euro, Britons are more detached.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These are all reasons why the British are different. Why, though, is Britain unique? The Nordics are free-traders who joined late and believe their national standards to be higher than Europe&#8217;s. Lots of east Europeans look to America for their security. Germany and Austria have their own Brussels-bashing tabloids. Sweden and Denmark both declined to join the euro.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The lure of the alternative</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The difference is that, although many of the others dislike aspects of the EU, they feel they have no real alternative. On many fronts, the British think they do. If a common EU foreign policy fails, Britain is still on the UN Security Council. If the euro collapses, Britain has the pound. Should EU regulation get too burdensome, there is always the chance of opt-outs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To de Gaulle&#8217;s generation, the EU was a solution to the &#8220;German problem&#8221;, above all. Yet the post-war cry of &#8220;never again&#8221; resounds less in Britain. But it matters greatly that, almost uniquely in Europe, the second world war is a positive memory in Britain&#8212;and that Britain has not been invaded for centuries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The danger for the British is that alternatives to full EU membership are themselves illusory. British Eurosceptics talk of a Swiss-style free-trade deal (though Britain would still have to apply EU rules that it could no longer influence). Similarly diehard advocates of EU integration dream of shunting Britain into an outer core, and building a more regulated inner core based on the euro. Such alternatives are illusory in part because, even if de Gaulle was right about Britain, he was wrong about Europe and how it would be changed by globalisation. To borrow his words, all EU countries are now linked by exchanges, markets and supply routes to diverse and far-flung places. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Europe will survive only if it acts more like a maritime power, its eyes fixed on growth and the far horizon. And Britain is needed to defend the free movement of people, goods, services and capital in the internal market. Walking away from the EU would not make either the club or its rules go away. In short, Britain and Europe are stuck with each other.</p>\r\n\

    <h2>George Osborne and David Laws have an unenviable job to do. Tax rises and welfare cuts are inevitable</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF THERE is one reason why a hung parliament produced Britain&#8217;s first coalition government for 65 years, it is the dire state of the public finances. The Conservatives realised that they needed a formal coalition with the Liberal Democrats for the full five-year lifetime of the parliament to push through the politically perilous slashing of public borrowing. The Lib Dems, for their part, feared that hanging back on the sidelines at a time of national emergency could undermine their credibility as a serious political force.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The starting point for the new team at the Treasury is a towering deficit of \xA3163 billion ($235 billion) in 2009-10, the fiscal year that ended in March. At 11.6% of national income, this was by far the biggest since the second world war. According to forecasts published by the IMF on May 14th, Britain&#8217;s deficit will be the highest in the G7 both this year and next (see chart). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This week the government lost no time in signposting how it will bring the public finances under control&#8212;a task so formidable that it will test the resolve and staying power of the coalition. George Osborne, the Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, said that spending cuts worth \xA36 billion in 2010-11 would be announced on May 24th. As for the other \xA3157 billion, the &#8220;emergency&#8221; budget he pledged before the election will be unveiled on June 22nd. This will set out the broad outline for the fiscal retrenchment that lies ahead and get the bad news out on planned tax rises. A spending review conducted by David Laws, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, will go where both parties feared to tread in the campaign and specify this autumn where the axe will actually fall.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The decision to press ahead with immediate spending cuts marked one of the first compromises of the coalition. Before the election the Lib Dems had criticised the Conservative intention to make reductions this year, arguing that cuts should be delayed until 2011 when the recovery would be more secure. But the fiscal crisis in Greece has shown the price that governments pay when they lose credibility in the markets. The Lib Dems now agree with the Tories on the need to demonstrate that the new government means business, although they have secured a minor concession in that a small part of the savings will be used to support jobs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Both Mr Osborne and Mr Laws stuck this week to the supposed difference between &#8220;front-line&#8221; services, which must be protected, and other spending on the public services and administration, where &#8220;wasteful&#8221; expenditure can be eliminated. The distinction is spurious: could the new ministers function in their &#8220;front-line&#8221; jobs without the back-up of civil servants? The first round of cuts will also include a pruning of quangos, a catch-all phrase for public bodies that exist outside the formal confines of government departments. They may be an easy target but Colin Talbot, a public-management specialist at Manchester Business School, says there is no evidence that quangos are inherently more wasteful than departments. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another weakness in the new team&#8217;s approach to cutting spending is that some public services are protected from real cuts. This follows the decision to ring-fence the National Health Service (a Tory commitment) while continuing to raise the small overseas-aid budget (a pledge made by both parties). And for this year defence will also be shielded while a strategic review is carried out. The drawback of protecting some budgets is that others face a more intense squeeze.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first round of cuts may arouse controversy but it will be as nothing compared with the ire likely to be provoked by the budget Mr Osborne will deliver in June. This will be the defining moment of the new coalition, as the chancellor sets out his long-term plan to rein in the deficit. It is bound to include tax rises and far harsher spending cuts than this year&#8217;s \xA36 billion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The budget will be preceded by a crucial report from the new Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which will set out independent economic and fiscal forecasts (see ). Headed by Sir Alan Budd, a former Treasury economic adviser, the OBR is widely expected to paint a bleaker picture than the fiscal projections in Labour&#8217;s last budget, in March. These were founded on an optimistic outlook for annual GDP growth, expected to run at over 3% in 2011 and beyond. This would be a rattling pace for an economy that has been badly damaged by the financial crisis. Independent forecasts made in the first half of April and compiled by the Treasury expected on average GDP growth of just 2% next year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A more realistic assessment from the OBR about Britain&#8217;s economic and fiscal prospects will surely pave the way for higher taxes. Taxation is already starting to rise this year with a new 50% rate of income tax on high earners. That, and other measures in the previous Labour government&#8217;s pipeline, will eventually push up tax by about one percentage point of GDP.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is not enough, and a rise in the main rate of VAT, a consumption tax, is widely expected. There were few squeals of anguish from the public when this was restored on January 1st to its usual rate of 17.5% after 13 months at 15% as part of the fiscal stimulus to fight the recession. A rise next year to 21%, for example, would generate extra revenues worth 1% of GDP. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Painful though higher taxes will be, the hardest job of the coalition government will be clamping down on spending. Public net investment is already scheduled to fall by a whole percentage point of GDP between this year and 2012-13. But that is an easy cut to make compared with reducing the running cost of public services, which will involve pay curbs and a jobs cull. The impact on unprotected departments will be draconian unless the welfare budget, which makes up nearly 30% of total spending, is curtailed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The one consolation is that even if fiscal consolidation is tough, monetary policy can probably remain lenient, which will help Britain&#8217;s heavily indebted households. Consumer-price inflation jumped in April to 3.7%, raising worries about the persistence of the upsurge. But the Bank of England remains convinced that inflation will retreat later this year as spare capacity bears down on prices. If it is right, it can offer monetary balm to ease the pain of the fiscal workout. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Why budgets will be more grown-up</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE parallel is beguiling. Within days of taking over the Treasury in 1997 Gordon Brown ceded his grip on interest rates to a new monetary-policy committee (MPC) at the Bank of England. Less than a week after George Osborne, in his turn, became chancellor, he announced plans to hand over power to a new Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In fact, the differences are more telling. Mr Brown&#8217;s move was a shock, whereas Mr Osborne&#8217;s had long been trailed. More important, Mr Brown relinquished monetary decisions to the MPC; the Tory chancellor retains full control over the levers of fiscal power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the reform matters. In monetary policy most agree that the goal is low and stable inflation; there is no such consensus about the aims of fiscal policy. For example, it is possible to achieve a balanced budget with a small or a big state. But if responsibility remains in the hands of politicians, all too often they let the public finances run out of control.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One solution is to set fiscal rules, but it has been discredited of late. Mr Brown made much of solemn restrictions on deficits and debt. But these were set and marked by his own Treasury. Alistair Darling, his successor, had to junk them in late 2008 as the public finances careered out of control. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That suggests the need for an institutional constraint. The OBR will provide the economic and fiscal forecasts on which budgets must be based. It will also assess whether the government is likely to meet the objectives the chancellor sets for reducing the deficit. Disregarding its views would be risky. As Mr Osborne said this week, he has deliberately created a rod for his own back by removing his right as chancellor to have the final say on budget forecasts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The OBR&#8217;s clout will come from the independence of the three-man committee chaired by Sir Alan Budd, who was one of the founder members of the MPC. The other two are Geoffrey Dicks, a City economist, and Graham Parker, a former fiscal-forecasting specialist at the Treasury. The new body will be able to draw on that department for economic models and manpower.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The OBR looks to Sweden rather than across the Atlantic for inspiration. In America the Congressional Budget Office answers to the legislature. It has plenty of resources, enabling it recently to cost proposals for reforming health care, for example. By contrast, the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council operates on a modest scale, providing an independent review of budgetary plans and performance.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One big change that Sir Alan will introduce is highlighting the uncertainty of fiscal forecasts. Like the central bank with its inflation projections, the OBR will stress not just the most likely path for the budget deficit but also what the chances are that it will be bigger or smaller. That in itself will be a sobering lesson.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>An entrenched dispute takes the shine off a proud airline</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EMPLOYEES of the Taff Vale Railway Company in South Wales greased the tracks and cut telegraph wires during a bitter strike in 1900. The next year the House of Lords ruled that their union could be sued for damaging the company. The shock to the union movement inspired the Labour Party and a 1906 Trade Disputes Act, aimed at protecting strikers from such retaliation through the courts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 18th in 2010, leaders of Unite, a trade union, invoked the spirit of Taff Vale after a court injunction stopped a threatened 20-day series of strikes by British Airways&#8217; cabin crew, 90% of whom are Unite members. The judgment, which Unite called an &#8220;absolute disgrace&#8221;, hung on a technicality: that the results of the strike ballot had not been relayed correctly to BA staff. The union immediately appealed, and on May 20th got the judgment overturned. So for BA the strike had only been delayed a bit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The court saga illustrates the unyielding antipathy in the dispute between Willie Walsh, BA&#8217;s punchy chief executive, and indignant cabin crew backed by a union that faces falling membership. It was triggered last year by BA&#8217;s plans to reduce crew numbers on long-haul flights from London&#8217;s Heathrow airport, but it is now mainly a war over the airline&#8217;s threats to deny discretionary free flights and other perks to those who strike. Most of the planned operational changes have been agreed, with compromises. But the animosity is doing added damage to an airline already beset by negatives&#8212;from volcanic ash, to dwindling long-haul travel and looming tax increases.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>British Airways is trying to cut costs, but seven days of strikes in March meant that it lost an estimated \xA345m ($65m). The mere threat of further industrial action has involved it in commitments to lease planes from other airlines and redeploy staff in order to fulfil its schedules.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, the low-cost airlines Ryanair and easyJet are snapping at its heels. The recession, and the way passenger taxes are graded by distance and standard of travel, have favoured their short-haul, no-frills model. While passenger numbers in the year to March increased at Ryanair by 13.6%, and at easyJet by 6.8%, BA saw them fall by 3.9%. By contrast, the number of travellers carried by BA&#8217;s German counterpart, Lufthansa, increased by 1.2%, despite the airline&#8217;s rumbling dispute with its pilots. Even the flight restrictions across Europe caused by ash from an Icelandic volcano seem to have hit BA the hardest, precipitating a 24.5% drop in passengers in April, compared with the same month a year earlier, whereas easyJet&#8217;s fell by just 7.6%. According to the companies&#8217; own estimates, the volcano cost BA \xA3180m, easyJet something up to \xA375m, Ryanair at least &#8364;42m (\xA337m) and Virgin Atlantic, BA&#8217;s domestic long-haul rival, around \xA383m.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More worrying for BA, however, is the trend away from conventional route networks based on big hubs to the ad hoc linking of airports by the low-cost airlines. Landing slots at prime airports are expensive. New airline taxes being considered by Britain&#8217;s new government may be applied per plane rather than per passenger, favouring the fuller planes of the low-cost companies. From 2012 a European emissions-trading scheme is to replace national taxes: it will penalise longer flights and emptier planes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The future may indeed lie with the low-cost airlines, but they would be foolish to bet on uninterrupted growth. Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of easyJet, resigned from its board on May 14th, criticising its plans to add 59 planes to a fleet of 189 against the twin uncertainties of volcanic ash and the euro crisis. However, with BA apparently floundering, perhaps this is the very time to grab market share.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Of hawks and doves</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>An emerging divide in the coalition, and how it may be healed</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SOME in the Labour Party are already smiling wryly. The beatific early days of the coalition government are giving way to the first glimmers of disunity, and over an entirely predictable issue too. Their leaders claim a common fealty to civil liberties, but most Conservatives differ from most Liberal Democrats on the proper balance between freedom and security. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 18th a special immigration court held that two suspected terrorists were serious threats to Britain but could not be deported to their native Pakistan as they might be tortured or &#8220;disappeared&#8221; by security agencies there. They were never tried because the evidence against them was too scant or too sensitive to reveal, so Theresa May, the Tory home secretary, is &#8220;taking all possible measures to ensure they do not engage in terrorist activity&#8221;. This could mean surveillance or, more controversially for Lib Dems, control orders, an enhanced form of house arrest they once denounced as &#8220;Kafkaesque&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The law that allows suspected terrorists to appeal against deportation in the first place also divides the two parties. The Tories made a manifesto pledge to replace the Human Rights Act (HRA), derived from the European Convention on Human Rights, with a British Bill of Rights that would be narrower in some areas. The Lib Dems hate that idea, and a new commission is to examine the issue. Many Tories, vigilant for signs of a sell-out to their junior coalition partners, suspect that the promised reform is hurtling towards the long grass. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The disagreements can probably be haggled away, with the Lib Dems getting their way (eventually) on human rights in return for agreeing to control orders. Coalition government is such a novel and interesting thing that almost any fudge or u-turn can be passed off as a natural product of the &#8220;new politics&#8221;, at least for now. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But rows over civil liberties are likely to keep emerging. True, both parties believe in some libertarian changes, as Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader, was keen to detail in a speech on May 19th. But many of these are relatively uncontroversial quick wins, such as scrapping plans for ID cards. Fundamental differences over security and criminal justice may prove more divisive over time. (The Tories themselves have disagreed behind the scenes on things such as detention without trial for terrorist suspects.) </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is no accident that Conservatives dominate the ministerial portfolios in these areas. There are no senior Lib Dem ministers at the home office, for instance, where Nick Herbert will be an influential hawk as policing minister. Political calculation, not just ideology, argues for the Tories jealously guarding these policy briefs. Pollsters and psephologists are still trying to work out why the Lib Dems&#8217; surge in popularity after their leader&#8217;s show-stealing performance in TV debates last month had faded by polling day. One factor was increased scrutiny of the party&#8217;s home-affairs policies. On issues such as custodial sentencing and immigration, Mr Clegg&#8217;s libertarianism found few takers. Tories are wary of co-opting the least popular bits of the Lib Dem manifesto. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An informal arrangement that gives Mr Clegg&#8217;s party great influence on economic policy but relatively little on matters of security may be enough to keep the coalition a happy ship. But some Tories go a step further, and privately predict that the Lib Dems will themselves become less libertarian in office. After all, they will be privy to disturbingly detailed intelligence about terrorist threats (an experience which affected their Labour predecessors deeply) and forced to participate in decisions, rather than mere parliamentary deliberations, about matters of life and death. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Any hardening of the heart that flows from these experiences may be entirely respectable, or it may amount to being nobbled by the security establishment, as some civil-liberties campaigners will have it. Either way, it is hard to imagine that the graver burdens of office will have no impact on the idealism of a party that has been excluded from power for so long. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The blame game</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Which party will the voters punish for tighter budgets?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | EDINBURGH | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHILE the rest of Britain&#8217;s public-sec- tor workers wait to hear where the new government&#8217;s spending axe will fall, Scotland is already bleeding. In recent days three big health boards serving Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee have said that about 3,700 jobs will go in the next two years. Glasgow University lecturers are likely to strike against plans to cut 80 of their jobs. For Alex Salmond, first minister of the devolved Scottish government, these developments are signs of a rapidly unravelling political strategy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>With an eye on elections to the Scottish Parliament due in May 2011, his thinking was that a spending squeeze by a Conservative administration at Westminster, with few MPs and little mandate north of the border, would drive voters into the arms of his Scottish National Party (SNP), especially if defeated Labour surrendered to an orgy of internal blood-letting.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Scottish voters partly obliged, returning only one Tory MP. Less conveniently, the coalition David Cameron went on to form includes 11 Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs, against the SNP&#8217;s six, and a combined 35.6% of the Scottish vote compared with the SNP&#8217;s 20%. Adroitly, Mr Cameron appointed a Highland Lib Dem, Danny Alexander, as Scottish secretary. The pair visited the Scottish Parliament (which Gordon Brown never did as prime minister) and pitched up on Mr Salmond&#8217;s doorstep for talks just three days after taking office. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A perplexed Mr Salmond confessed to being impressed by his first meeting with Mr Cameron, saying that it was more substantive than he had expected. He presented the new prime minister with a \xA3695m bill, money he claims is owed to Scotland and which Labour had refused to pay. Disarmingly, Mr Cameron said he would look at it, hinting that he might be willing to turn over an estimated \xA3180m of Scottish fossil-fuel levies held by the Treasury.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Cameron is also showing a sudden enthusiasm for plans to give the Scottish Parliament more powers over tax. Under a plan devised by a commission chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, formerly Britain&#8217;s chief medical officer, London would set Scottish income-tax rates at ten percentage points lower than those for Britain as a whole. Scotland&#8217;s block grant, currently \xA336 billion, would be cut by a proportional amount. The Scottish finance minister would then set Scottish tax rates to fill the gap, or perhaps raise more or less. With devolution of some minor taxes, such as landfill tax, Scotland would gain control of about 16% of its budget.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>While this may move his country a bit closer to the independence Mr Salmond desires, it is a two-edged sword. London would be able to tell a Scottish government complaining about spending cuts to raise the money itself&#8212;from Scottish taxpayers rather than English ones.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, Mr Salmond is anxious to pin the blame for budget cuts on the Tories and Lib Dems, while holding Labour accountable for causing the fiscal mess in the first place. But far from being cowed by the election, Scottish Labourites were cheered by holding all 39 of their seats and winning back two more lost in by-elections, increasing their share of the vote. They are busily pointing the finger at Mr Salmond, noting that the cuts in health and university budgets now being announced have come before George Osborne, the new chancellor, even begins his promised squeeze.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 19th Kenny MacAskill, Scotland&#8217;s justice secretary, was forced to explain why civil servants had allegedly told Scottish chief constables to delay the staff cuts needed to reduce the budget deficit until after the British government announced its spending plans. Mr MacAskill said the bureaucrats were ensuring that an SNP pledge to increase police numbers was being fulfilled, despite budget reductions that he claimed had already been imposed by Gordon Brown&#8217;s government.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This complicated blame game will intensify as the Scottish elections approach. Mr Salmond has played it skilfully so far, but as spending cuts start to bite he will have to work harder if he is to persuade Scots that his hands are clean. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Lurking in the long grass</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A review of tuition fees is poised to unsettle coalition government</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FAIRNESS featured heavily in the election campaign. So did fiscal sustainability. Exactly what either concept means when applied to university students is set to become a political hot potato. On May 20th and 21st a select band of economists, policy wonks and university vice-chancellors were expected to urge that students be charged more for their studies. Should the official review set up by Labour into funding higher education accept that recommendation, as most observers think likely, it could turn the uneasy alliance in power between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats into open warfare. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Britain crawls out of recession, demand for university education has been soaring. But tens of thousands of youngsters have been denied the chance because the exchequer cannot afford it. Places are heavily subsidised. Students get loans to cover tuition fees that cannot exceed \xA33,225 a year. They need repay the money only after they are earning a decent whack, paying interest equal to inflation in the meantime. The government picks up most of the difference between the capped fees and the actual cost of educating students (which averages, with huge variations by institution and subject, about \xA36,400).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The central question is how to make sure universities have the funds they need to teach all those interested in studying and academically equipped to do so while maintaining quality. This was a contentious subject long before the fiscal crisis lent it urgency. The previous Labour government fought its own backbenchers to bring in fees at their current level. A commission under Lord Browne, a former boss of BP, is revisiting the matter, and is due to report by the autumn. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An obvious solution is to let universities charge higher fees. Research has shown that potential students are willing to pay substantial sums for courses leading to professional careers. Institutions that attract large numbers of international students, who pay fees of up to \xA320,000 a year, argue that the cap for domestic students should be lifted completely. Some fear that this could turn off poorer students. Another risk is that it might overload the exchequer. Students do not pay tuition fees; graduates repay the state&#8217;s loan, sometimes many years after it was made.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One way of financing an increased subsidy would be to charge a higher rate of interest on student loans, perhaps the rate at which the government itself usually borrows. More people would be able to study, though it would take them longer to pay back the loan. And that would matter: the average age of a first-time house buyer with no parental help has already risen to 37, up from 33 in 2007.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In America, where many elite universities are free to charge what they like, some of the best have used the money to run &#8220;needs-blind&#8221; admissions policies, choosing applicants on the basis of their academic potential rather than their ability to pay. A British study published on May 19th by the Office for Fair Access, a quango set up in 2004 to attempt to ensure that higher fees did not deter poor students, found disproportionately few students from ill-educated families enrolled at elite universities. That is hardly surprising, since such youngsters tend to flunk exams. It suggested that, should Lord Browne recommend an increase in tuition fees, universities should spend some of the money on identifying bright but disadvantaged youngsters at an early age, giving them support and advice over many years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such a sop is unlikely to pacify the Lib Dems, who promised, before the election, to abolish tuition fees when they could afford to do so. The Tories pledged in their manifesto to consider seriously whatever measures Lord Browne&#8217;s review proposes. Under the coalition agreement, Lib Dem MPs will be allowed to abstain if they are unhappy with the resulting legislation. That would leave the proposals, fair or not, vulnerable to defeat. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A self-inflicted blow to hopes of hosting football&#8217;s global party</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THERE is a certain mix of anger and emptiness with which any football fan is familiar. A player makes a stupid mistake, and your team is needlessly 1-0 down. Many English fans are suffering from a new strain of this ailment. The country&#8217;s football chiefs are bidding to host the World Cup in 2018 and until a few days ago seemed at last to have found some form. It was a bright idea, for example, to send David Beckham, a fine if ageing player and a global brand in human form, to present the 1,752-page &#8220;bid book&#8221; to FIFA, the sport&#8217;s global governing body, on May 14th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Less bright was a conversation between Mr Beckham&#8217;s co-presenter, David Triesman, chairman both of the Football Association (FA), which governs the English game, and of the team bidding for 2018, and Melissa Jacobs, a former aide. Lord Triesman accused Russia and Spain, rival bidders, of skulduggery. There was &#8220;some evidence&#8221;, he said, that Spain wanted to bribe referees in the World Cup in South Africa next month, and was trying to enlist Russia&#8217;s help. Should Spain drop out of the running for 2018, its votes might then go to Russia. Alas, Miss Jacobs was wired; and poor Lord Triesman&#8217;s indiscretion was splashed all over the <em>Mail on Sunday</em>.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Lord Triesman resigned both his chairmanships speedily, to limit the damage. But FIFA is in no hurry to draw a line under the affair. Its ethics committee will investigate the allegation, no doubt at length.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But is the World Cup in fact worth having? After all, in two years&#8217; time London will play host to the Olympic games, at a cost to the rapidly emptying public purse of about \xA39 billion ($13 billion). The Olympics have probably gone past the point of no return, but staging another sporting jamboree so soon, when money is so tight, may look like a luxury too far.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The World Cup would be much cheaper. For the Olympics, lots of expensive sporting venues, not to mention facilities for journalists and accommodation for athletes, are being built. Uses will have to be found for all these when the circus has left town. The games are also a front for the attempted resurrection of a grubby part of East London, involving new railways and utilities. The World Cup makes few such demands. Matches would be played in stadiums that have already been built, or will be, by private money: football clubs&#8217; owners believe, rightly or wrongly, that new stadiums will pay for themselves, as fans turn up to matches for years to come.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even so, the World Cup would cost some public money. Security, for instance, must be paid for. And the councils of the 12 cities hoping to stage matches have been trying to tot up the likely bill for free public transport, &#8220;Fan Fests&#8221; (where supporters can watch games on giant screens), temporary seating to bring stadiums up to FIFA&#8217;s minimum capacity of 40,000, and so forth. Bristol reckons it will have to find an extra \xA317m, compared with an annual budget of \xA3398m; Plymouth puts the bill at about \xA315m. Both are trying to think of ways of defraying the cost, such as special levies on local businesses or on hotel beds. Most of the expense will come in 2017-19, but a bill for \xA3250,000 towards the FA&#8217;s marketing costs falls due now.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Councils want the World Cup nevertheless, believing that local economies will gain hundreds of millions of pounds from football-loving visitors. PricewaterhouseCoopers, a firm of consultants, thinks the event could add \xA33.2 billion to GDP, if enough foreign fans stay a while.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Worth winning? Maybe. In any event, the game is not yet up. England has much to offer Fifa. Spain, though, can say the same. And Russia, unlike England and Spain, has never hosted a World Cup; its vast emerging market may also be an advantage. In December FIFA will decide&#8212;and the English will find out whether Lord Triesman&#8217;s own goal was decisive.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>What kind of leader does the Labour Party need to take on the coalition?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS one of the forgiven hypocrisies of politics. Immediately after the electoral debacle, ambitious survivors in the ranks of a humbled party purport to explain why it lost. Most people are too polite to ask why they didn&#8217;t share those insights a few weeks earlier. Then, like penitent medieval monarchs, they depart on pilgrimages to &#8220;listen&#8221; to the voters and &#8220;unite&#8221; their followers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Labour&#8217;s penitents&#8212;and would-be leaders&#8212;seem set to include David Miliband and his younger brother Ed, until recently the foreign and energy secretaries respectively; Ed Balls, the former children&#8217;s secretary; Andy Burnham, an ex-health secretary; and Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, two left-wing outsiders. Each must secure the backing of 33 MPs before nominations in the party&#8217;s leadership election close on June 9th. The winner, chosen by a complex voting procedure, will be announced at the start of its annual conference on September 25th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This contest has been anticipated for years. The line-up is roughly as predicted. But there is an unexpected context: in ways that many in the Labour Party are yet to appreciate, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition has redefined the demands and prospects of opposition, as well as the shape of government.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>First, and most obviously, the coalition is fragile. The spending cuts and tax rises it will soon be implementing will add fresh strains and the pressure of unpopularity. Meanwhile, one of the reasons the Tories were forced to treat with the Lib Dems is that Labour&#8217;s performance in the general election was less apocalyptic than once seemed likely. It was routed in the south of England, and won its second-lowest share of the overall vote since the advent of universal suffrage. But with 258 MPs it is much better placed to recover than, say, the Tories, with 165, were in 1997. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not long ago, pundits questioned whether a Labour leader would ever again be prime minister. Now it seems plausible that the next one might&#8212;even quite soon, if the coalition cracks. That argues for a mature politician, such as David Miliband or Mr Balls, rather than a promising novice.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then too, the coalition has provided Labour&#8217;s new leader with a valuable luxury. He will head Britain&#8217;s only national opposition party at Westminster. There is no mainstream &#8220;plague on both your houses&#8221; option of the kind the Lib Dems hitherto supplied. Labour has a chance to capture all the discontented (though if it botches it, smaller protest parties could prosper). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the other hand, the &#8220;new politics&#8221; carries risks. The job of leader of the opposition involves a canny mix of statesmanlike agreement with the government and dissent. At least, it should: denunciation for its own sake sometimes proves irresistible. As attention focuses, as it will, on the chemistry of the coalition, Labour&#8217;s new chief may be more inclined than normal to resort to high-volume vitriol. Yet a bombastic, overly tribal leader may well seem unappealing in the coalition era (and he may one day be called upon to lead a coalition of his own). Labour needs someone equipped for consensus as well as battle. Here both Milibands and Mr Burnham have the edge over Mr Balls.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are ideological perils as well as stylistic ones. The Lib Dems have quit the opposition field, but the coalition is occupying much of the intellectual ground of politics, from constitutional reform through poverty reduction to tax-cutting. Already, the Labour candidates&#8217; rhetoric feels unoriginal, laden with unobjectionable talk about social cohesion that would sit easily in one of David Cameron&#8217;s speeches (or Tony Blair&#8217;s). It will take an imaginative thinker to hone a message at once sensible and distinct.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So blandness is a hazard&#8212;particularly since, like Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, Labour&#8217;s next leader seems likely to be a white male in his early forties, who graduated from Oxbridge into a gruesomely professional political career. (The serious contenders all owe their status to the patronage of Mr Blair or Gordon Brown, making it hard for them to transcend the old Blair-Brown split, as they promise to.) All the same, the urge to diverge will be an even greater risk than conformity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When Mr Blair pitched his big tent on the centre ground of politics in 1997, he drove the Tories rightward into unelectability. The big danger for Labour and its candidates is that they, too, indulge in the typical vice of defeat, and seek consolation in old party pieties: that they respond to the coalition&#8217;s capacious centrism by heading left, towards higher taxes and fantasy spending. The timing of the leadership race&#8212;to be run as the coalition begins to impose cuts, and details more in next month&#8217;s budget&#8212;may make that sort of politics seem more beguiling. David Miliband, who stresses his liberalism as well as social democracy, seems least likely to succumb to this temptation. The two Eds, Miliband and Balls, sometimes seem to think that the paternalistic state can solve all social ills&#8212;a view that appeals to some in their party but has been tested to destruction during the past 13 years. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The truth hurts</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An acknowledgment of the state&#8217;s limitations is part of a broader reckoning that Labour has yet to face. So far, its analysis has addressed how it lost&#8212;by alienating too many blue-collar voters, for example&#8212;rather than why. Several candidates have noted its inability to persuade on welfare and immigration (issues that the party may try to seize from the coalition, just as Mr Cameron raided Labour&#8217;s intellectual territory and Mr Blair invaded his Tory predecessors&#8217;). But they have concentrated on Labour&#8217;s failure to convey its message rather than on its substantive mistakes. They have described the defeat, rather than properly accounting for it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So Labour needs a leader fitted for the &#8220;new politics&#8221;, able to be conciliatory as well as ruthless. But it also needs someone with the gumption to take the ritual post-election hypocrisy beyond platitudes and into harsh truths. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Not just any deal will do</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Have Brazil and Turkey helped solve a brewing nuclear crisis, or made it worse?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TO IRAN&#8217;S irrepressible president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the deal was a triumph for the powers of the future over &#8220;the tyrant powers [who] belong to the past&#8221;. Others, tyrannically minded or not, have yet to see whether Brazil&#8217;s president, Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, and Turkey&#8217;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan (flanking Mr Ahmadinejad above), really have succeeded in enticing Iran a step in from the cold in its row with the UN Security Council over its nuclear ambitions. Several years of on-off talks (mostly off, at Iran&#8217;s insistence) between Mr Ahmadinejad&#8217;s government and six other countries, America, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have failed to budge Iran from its insistence that its suspect nuclear work will continue, no matter what.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Under the May 17th deal, Mr Ahmadinejad is to send abroad some of his low-enriched uranium stocks, in return for higher-enriched fuel rods Iran needs to replenish an ageing medical-research reactor. On the face of it, that resembles a bargain Iran had first struck last October with America, Russia, France and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN&#8217;s nuclear guardian, before it backed off. But the fear is that, well-meaning as the leaders of Turkey and Brazil may be, Iran is abusing their efforts to get out of a fix.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To those with past experience of Iran&#8217;s tactics, both timing and terms of the new deal look deeply suspect. Iran is facing a fourth set of UN sanctions. Two days after the Tehran &#8220;breakthrough&#8221;, a draft resolution agreed by the six countries Iran has been refusing to talk to, including previously reluctant Russia and China, was circulated to the rest of the Security Council. That was despite the claim by Turkey&#8217;s foreign minister that the Tehran deal meant further sanctions were now unwarranted. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> If voted through, the new resolution would add more names to a list of individuals, firms and banks sanctioned for their links to Iran&#8217;s nuclear and missile programmes and slap an arms embargo on heavy weapons. Suspect shipments to and from Iran could be searched. Iran would find it much harder to get foreign uranium for its enrichment machines, which Mr Ahmadinejad claims he set spinning merely to produce under 5% low-enriched uranium for nuclear-power reactors (though Iran has none that can use it), while others suspect it may eventually be used to make the 90%-enriched stuff needed for a bomb. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Iran pooh-poohs sanctions, claiming even new ones won&#8217;t make it give up its &#8220;right&#8221; to enrich uranium. But its leaders have been courting other Security Council members, especially Brazil and Turkey. For, whatever their economic impact, widely supported UN sanctions do give the lie to Iran&#8217;s claims that it is the victim of a Western-inspired plot to deprive it of its right to nuclear energy, rather than being in the dock for what IAEA inspectors report have been serious violations of its nuclear safeguards. Iran also refuses point blank to answer more questions about activities that have little rational explanation except as part of a weapons effort.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Iran thus wants to block or delay a sanctions vote. But even if the October deal had gone through, harsher moves would have remained in play, both because their aim is to get Iran into wider talks than just those over fuel for its research reactor; and because, without pressure, Iran would be free to drag out talks uselessly. The October fuel deal was a gamble: Iran called it an acceptance of its &#8220;right&#8221; to uranium enrichment. But the rewards, had it chosen to negotiate seriously, were deemed worth the risk.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> By shipping two-thirds of its then low-enriched uranium abroad, Iran would have been left, for perhaps six months while it rebuilt stocks, with less uranium in the country than would be needed, with further enrichment, for a breakout to a nuclear bomb. This, it was hoped, might create time for wider talks. More to the point, Russia&#8217;s offer to enrich the uranium from under 5% to the almost 20% needed for the medical reactor, along with France&#8217;s readiness to turn it into the needed fuel rods, mean Iran had no excuse to do the higher enrichment work itself. For it is a quirk of uranium enrichment that to get from 20% to 90% takes less effort than making the lesser-enriched stuff in the first place.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If a deal was worth trying then, surely it is worth trying now? But much has changed. Iran&#8217;s stock of low-enriched uranium is bigger: only about half of it would be needed to produce the equivalent fuel load for the medical reactor. Iran could have a full bomb&#8217;s-worth on hand again in no time. Earlier this year, Iran started its own 20% enrichment and insists that this will continue. That wipes out the hoped for non-proliferation gain, and may be a deal-breaker. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile the terms of the new accord are vague. Mr Ahmadinejad is to set out his ideas to the IAEA within days. But then he can take all the time he likes to haggle over details with America, France, Russia and the IAEA. Under the old deal, the uranium would have gone directly to Russia, then France for reworking. Under the new one, Turkey will take custody of it. But Turkey has no way to enrich it or make it into fuel. Does Iran expect to get the 20% enriched fuel rods from another source, while its own uranium is under Turkish guard? Also, under the deal with Turkey and Brazil, Mr Ahmadinejad can decide whether the deal is going as he likes. If it isn&#8217;t, Turkey must hand back his uranium forthwith.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For those trying to talk Iran out of potentially weapons-usable work, this seems to get them nowhere. But it could leave the Security Council split and make an end to the stand-off with Iran harder. Mr Ahmadinejad would be the winner. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A rapper learns what is expected of the modern celanthropist</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;THEY took away my Twitter,&#8221; moans Wyclef Jean, only half-joking. If anybody thought it was easy to mix success as an entertainer with a saintly image, his recent story is a cautionary tale. &#8220;They&#8221; refers to an army of PR and marketing professionals hired to restore the Haitian-born musician&#8217;s reputation after questions were asked about the management of his charitable foundation, Y\xE9le Haiti. And &#8220;their&#8221; wish to silence him seems understandable. Shortly after he started raising money for victims of the Haiti earthquake in January, a website called Smoking Gun published tax returns from the foundation (three years&#8217; worth were filed on one day last August), showing payments to businesses owned by Wyclef and his partners. After a tearful statement in which he admitted &#8220;mistakes&#8221; but denied misappropriating funds, he unleashed a barrage of tweets. One said: &#8220;My Garage could fit half of the people on twitter why would I steal Charity Money!&#8221; And in April, after a surge of gossip about his relationship with the foundation&#8217;s vice-president, Zakiya Khatou-Chevassus, he tweeted: &#8220;Donkeys spread rumours about me I don&#8217;t respond cause I&#8217;m the master that leads them to the well to drink the water.&#8221; Now, says one of his new advisers, &#8220;Wyclef is only allowed to tweet under supervision.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The professional approach of stars like Bono, Shakira, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie has raised the expectations of other celebrities engaged in philanthropy, says Trevor Neilson of the Global Philanthropy Group, which advises a roster of so-called &#8220;celanthropists&#8221;. &#8220;It is no longer enough to turn up on a red carpet and say charitable things. You have to be businesslike.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That entails at least three things. First is that it is a mistake to rely on friends and family, however trusted, to oversee your philanthropic activities: hire respected professionals. Wyclef insists that Y\xE9le&#8217;s problems were the result not of any dishonesty but of hiring the wrong people. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know any celebrity who sits down with their accountant and goes through the numbers,&#8221; he maintains. Maybe so. But that makes it all the more important that the accountant is of the highest quality. Y\xE9le now has a new accountant, as well as not one but two advisory firms. One is New Partners, an advocacy firm founded by some former members of Barack Obama&#8217;s campaign team. The other is Euro RSCG, a global advertising firm.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Second, full transparency is a must. &#8220;Y\xE9le had never disclosed how much it had raised, how much money came from Clef and his family, how many hours they put in,&#8221; says Marian Salzman, of Euro RSCG. Accounts were filed late, if at all, and contained little data on how money was spent. Inquiries from the media often went unanswered. Now, Y\xE9le pumps out fresh information. As of March 10th, it had raised $9,139, 324 for relief activities, it says, of which $1,327,764 had been spent. Recipients included other non-profit bodies, including outfits providing food and water; other costs included shipping and rental.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The third element is to focus on something that makes a clear difference, says Mr Neilson. In this respect, Bono has gone further than any other celebrity through his One organisation: it worked with McKinsey, a consulting firm, to hone its thinking on how best to promote aid, trade and debt relief for poor countries. Y\xE9le has so far pursued a more scattergun approach, although there seems to be the germ of a strategy in Wyclef&#8217;s talk about rebuilding Haiti through job creation and investment. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For now, the rebuilding of Haiti is too slow, he says. As a celebrity, he can make sure people don&#8217;t forget about the ongoing tragedy; that may explain why many people trying to put the country back on its feet are willing to forgive his past failings, especially now he is working to amend them. Other celanthropists may wish to avoid getting into a position where they need a second chance. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>With new technology and new concerns, \xE9migr\xE9s reinvent themselves</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> AT A Hindu temple in Chicago, hundreds of people of Indian descent, professing many faiths, turned up from across Illinois and farther afield to hear a speaker from back home. But the meeting on May 15th was not the usual style of diaspora politics, in which a nation&#8217;s far-flung children are urged to cheer for the homeland.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The man they came to see was Jayaprakash Narayan, head of a movement called Lok Satta which opposes corruption and wants electoral reform. And the aim of his month-long American tour, which includes venues like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Google headquarters in California, is to get support from Indian-Americans for a drive to correct some of India&#8217;s failings. That sounds a lot better than passing round the hat for hardline Hindu nationalist causes, something else that occurs in the diaspora.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Bad, sleazy government, Mr Narayan says, is holding India back, crippling the country in its race with China. Having voted with their feet by leaving the country, he adds, Indians abroad should now help make their homeland worth staying in. Independent India&#8217;s early rulers had picked up statist ideas when studying in Britain; a new cohort of Indians, having thrived in economies like America&#8217;s, are nudging the country towards a freer market. This transmission of ideas, he notes, is easier in an electronic age.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> All this is a long way from ethnic lobbying of the old school, in which people from country A are persuaded to use their votes to tilt their new homeland&#8217;s policies and make them less favourable to country (or regime) B, their ancient bugbear. Or else they are urged to fight old causes in an even more direct way&#8212;by sending money to extremist groups. In almost every democracy that has received migrants from troubled places, the influence (or at least, perceived influence) of groups committed to particular national causes has been a feature of political life, and of foreign-policy debates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former American national security adviser, has controversially described the Cuban-Americans, the Armenian-Americans and the supporters of Israel as the three most effective groups in Washington, DC&#8212;while agreeing that the lobby of his native Poland &#8220;was at one time influential&#8221;. A landmark in the efforts of ethnic groups to affect American foreign policy was the arms embargo placed on Turkey in the 1970s, under the sway of Greek-Americans angry over the Turkish takeover of northern Cyprus.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Until recently at least, it seemed that the influence of ethnic constituencies was doomed to fade. For one thing, the communities on which they were based are blurring into wider societies. Gone are the days when Irish-Americans looked mainly to fellow Hibernians to socialise with; today&#8217;s Lebanese-Australian teenager is as likely to hang out with youngsters from Vietnam as with other Levantines. In America, meanwhile, support for Israel is no longer an especially Jewish cause; the largest body of pro-Israel hawks are evangelical Christians, while many Jews are critical of Israeli policies,</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> True, groups can hold together as long as there is one big woe to be redressed. For Armenians, the big cause is recognition that the mass killings of 1915 were genocide. Yet the power of a single issue cuts both ways: once the great cause is achieved (as with Baltic independence in 1991) or lost (as with Sri Lanka&#8217;s Tamils), the reason for hanging together can fade away. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Life in the old dog</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Despite all this, the latest signs are that diasporas have life in them yet. As Mr Narayan shows, they are interacting with their homelands in more creative ways. The American Ireland Fund has raised over $250m, mainly from rich Irish-Americans, to promote charitable causes, and above all inter-community relations; a lot better than giving money for guns. A new breed of wealthy Greek-Americans is doing more interesting things than counting congressional votes: funding libraries, scholarships and university chairs in Hellenic studies in the United States, for example. And this week George Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, met successful businessmen of Hellenic origin from five countries (such as Andrew Liveris, chief executive of America&#8217;s Dow Chemical company), in the hope that they could lend their struggling homeland some badly needed pizzazz.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But perhaps the main reason why diasporas are perking up is simply the new ease of communications. With the internet and social networks, people with a common origin or concern can stay in touch and pool their efforts&#8212;with a flexibility and spontaneity that would amaze old-time lobbyists, reliant on faxes, phones and foreign-ministry briefings.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Take a diaspora as obscure as the Indians are visible. The Circassians descend from a Caucasus nation obliterated by Russia&#8217;s tsar in the mid-19th century, losing around half its 2m population. Nine out of ten Circassians now live in diaspora: survivors fled to all corners of the Ottoman empire and beyond. Only 20 years ago, they were dwindling, with moribund diaspora bodies under Soviet tutelage. The internet is rekindling the cause. Facebook and Twitter link thousands of Circassians, helping them raise the national profile. Facebook groups and Twitter feeds enabled Circassians to co-ordinate the protests held on May 21st in Berlin, Istanbul, New York, The Hague and Washington, DC, to mark the 146th anniversary of what they term a genocide. They plan to make their feelings known at Sochi&#8212;the site of the killings&#8212;during the 2014 Olympics.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Politics is just one part of the diaspora&#8217;s e-revival. Reassembling fragmented cultures is another. Circassians can find their long-lost music and dance on YouTube. Information about history and culture that was once obscure or falsified is now a click away. Online Circassian dictionaries and language courses are emerging. Internet forums can facilitate the search for a spouse. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> For some diasporas, any alternative to politics is welcome. In Ukraine the diaspora is the biggest donor for the Ukrainian Catholic University, the country&#8217;s main independent provider of higher learning. Rigorous education is less glamorous than getting Ukraine into NATO or keeping the Russian bear at bay. But the gains are palpable, in contrast to the chaos and corruption of Kiev politics which faze many \xE9migr\xE9s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such stories mark a big turnaround for diasporas, which over the last century have often had to wage an uphill struggle against time and geography. &#8220;One by one, all remaining links to our old life are vanishing [&#8230;] Our Baghdad, <em>my</em> Baghdad is gone for ever.&#8221; So concludes &#8220;Memories of Eden&#8221;, Violette Shamash&#8217;s reflections on Jewish life in that city. A community which a century ago made up almost 40% of the city&#8217;s population now lives chiefly in fading memories. But the people to whom memories are dear (if only because of things heard from grandparents) can now cultivate and share them more easily.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> E-communications provide some hope of keeping at bay all the forces which threaten the existence of diasporas, especially small ones: assimilation (seen in the decline of once-mighty tongues like Yiddish and Latino) and the danger of irrelevance as the world moves on. But that will only work if the will to keep old languages and cultures alive really exists. In the easy-come, easy-go ethos of the electronic age, virtual communities die as well as live.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>For want of a drink</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Finite, vital, much wanted, little understood, water looks unmanageable. But it needn&#8217;t be, argues John Grimond (interviewed )</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN the word water appears in print these days, crisis is rarely far behind. Water, it is said, is the new oil: a resource long squandered, now growing expensive and soon to be overwhelmed by insatiable demand. Aquifers are falling, glaciers vanishing, reservoirs drying up and rivers no longer flowing to the sea. Climate change threatens to make the problems worse. Everyone must use less water if famine, pestilence and mass migration are not to sweep the globe. As it is, wars are about to break out between countries squabbling over dams and rivers. If the apocalypse is still a little way off, it is only because the four horsemen and their steeds have stopped to search for something to drink.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The language is often overblown, and the remedies sometimes ill conceived, but the basic message is not wrong. Water is indeed scarce in many places, and will grow scarcer. Bringing supply and demand into equilibrium will be painful, and political disputes may increase in number and intensify in their capacity to cause trouble. To carry on with present practices would indeed be to invite disaster.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Why? The difficulties start with the sheer number of people using the stuff. When, 60 years ago, the world&#8217;s population was about 2.5 billion, worries about water supply affected relatively few people. Both drought and hunger existed, as they have throughout history, but most people could be fed without irrigated farming. Then the green revolution, in an inspired combination of new crop breeds, fertilisers and water, made possible a huge rise in the population. The number of people on Earth rose to 6 billion in 2000, nearly 7 billion today, and is heading for 9 billion in 2050. The area under irrigation has doubled and the amount of water drawn for farming has tripled. The proportion of people living in countries chronically short of water, which stood at 8% (500m) at the turn of the 21st century, is set to rise to 45% (4 billion) by 2050. And already 1 billion people go to bed hungry each night, partly for lack of water to grow food.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>People in temperate climates where the rain falls moderately all the year round may not realise how much water is needed for farming. In Britain, for example, farming takes only 3% of all water withdrawals. In the United States, by contrast, 41% goes for agriculture, almost all of it for irrigation. In China farming takes nearly 70%, and in India nearer 90%. For the world as a whole, agriculture accounts for almost 70%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Farmers&#8217; increasing demand for water is caused not only by the growing number of mouths to be fed but also by people&#8217;s desire for better-tasting, more interesting food. Unfortunately, it takes nearly twice as much water to grow a kilo of peanuts as a kilo of soyabeans, nearly four times as much to produce a kilo of beef as a kilo of chicken, and nearly five times as much to produce a glass of orange juice as a cup of tea. With 2 billion people around the world about to enter the middle class, the agricultural demands on water would increase even if the population stood still.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Industry, too, needs water. It takes about 22% of the world&#8217;s withdrawals. Domestic activities take the other 8%. Together, the demands of these two categories quadrupled in the second half of the 20th century, growing twice as fast as those of farming, and forecasters see nothing but further increases in demand on all fronts. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>That&#8217;s your lot</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meeting that demand is a different task from meeting the demand for almost any other commodity. One reason is that the supply of water is finite. The world will have no more of it in 2025, or 2050, or when the cows come home, than it has today, or when it lapped at the sides of Noah&#8217;s ark. This is because the law of conservation of mass says, broadly, that however you use it, you cannot destroy the stuff. Neither can you readily make it. If some of it seems to come from the skies, that is because it has evaporated from the Earth&#8217;s surface, condensed and returned.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Most of this surface is sea, and the water below it&#8212;over 97% of the total on Earth&#8212;is salty. In principle the salt can be removed to increase the supply of fresh water, but at present desalination is expensive and uses lots of energy. Although costs have come down, no one expects it to provide wide-scale irrigation soon.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Of the 2\xBD% of water that is not salty, about 70% is frozen, either at the poles, in glaciers or in permafrost. So all living things, except those in the sea, have about 0.75% of the total to survive on. Most of this available water is underground, in aquifers or similar formations. The rest is falling as rain, sitting in lakes and reservoirs or flowing in rivers where it is, with luck, replaced by rainfall and melting snow and ice. There is also, take note, water vapour in the atmosphere. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These geophysical facts affect the use of language in discussions about water, and the ways in which to think about the problems of scarcity. As Julia Bucknall, the World Bank&#8217;s water supremo, points out, demand and supply are economic concepts, which the matchmakers of the dismal science are constantly trying to bring into balance. In the context of water, though, supply is also a physical concept and its maximum is fixed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Use is another awkward word. If your car runs out of petrol, you have used a tankful. The petrol has been broken down and will not soon be reconstituted. But if you drain a tank of water for your shower, have you used it? Yes, in a sense. But could it not be collected to invigorate the plants in your garden? And will some of it not then seep into the ground to refill an aquifer, or perhaps run into a river, from either of which someone else may draw it? This water has been used, but not in the sense of rendered incapable of further use. Water is not the new oil. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, there are some &#8220;uses&#8221; that leave it unusable for anyone else. That is either when it evaporates, from fields, swimming pools, reservoirs or cooling towers, or when it transpires, in the photosynthetic process whereby water vapour passes from the leaves of growing plants into the atmosphere. These two processes, known in combination as evapotranspiration (ET), tend to be overlooked by water policymakers. Yet over 60% of all the rain and snow that hits the ground cannot be captured because it evaporates from the soil or transpires through plants. Like water that cannot be recovered for a specific use because it has run into the sea or perhaps a saline aquifer, water lost through ET is, at least until nature recycles it, well and truly used&#8212;or, in the language of the water world, &#8220;consumed&#8221;, ie, not returned to the system for possible reuse. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The problems caused by inexact terminology do not end here. Concepts like efficiency, productivity and saving attract woolly thinking. Chris Perry, an irrigation economist widely considered the high priest of water accounting, points out that &#8220;efficient&#8221; domestic systems involve virtually no escape of water through evaporation or irrecoverable seepage. &#8220;Efficient&#8221; irrigation, though, is often used to describe systems that result in 85% of the water disappearing in vapour. Similarly, water is not saved by merely using less of it for a purpose such as washing or irrigation; it is saved only if less is rendered irrecoverable. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Soaked, parched, poached</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many of these conceptual difficulties arise from other unusual aspects of water. It is a commodity whose value varies according to locality, purpose and circumstance. Take locality first. Water is not evenly distributed&#8212;just nine countries account for 60% of all available fresh supplies&#8212;and among them only Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Congo, Indonesia and Russia have an abundance. America is relatively well off, but China and India, with over a third of the world&#8217;s population between them, have less than 10% of its water. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even within countries the variations may be huge. The average annual rainfall in India&#8217;s north-east is 110 times that in its western desert. And many places have plenty of water, or even far too much, at some times of year, but not nearly enough at others. Most of India&#8217;s crucial rain is brought by the summer monsoon, which falls, with luck, in just a few weeks between June and September. Flooding is routine, and may become more frequent and damaging with climate change. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Scarce or plentiful, water is above all local. It is heavy&#8212;one cubic metre weighs a tonne&#8212;so expensive to move. If you are trying to manage it, you must first divide your area of concern into drainage basins. Surface water&#8212;mostly rivers, lakes and reservoirs&#8212;will not flow from one basin into another without artificial diversion, and usually only with pumping. Within a basin, the water upstream may be useful for irrigation, industrial or domestic use. As it nears the sea, though, the opportunities diminish to the point where it has no uses except to sustain deltas, wetlands and the estuarial ecology, and to carry silt out to sea.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> These should not be overlooked. If rivers do not flow, nothing can live in them. Over a fifth of the world&#8217;s freshwater fish species of a century ago are now endangered or extinct. Half the world&#8217;s wetlands have also disappeared over the past 100 years. The point is, though, that even within a basin water is more valuable in some places than in others.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Almost anywhere arid, the water underground, once largely ignored, has come to be seen as especially valuable as the demands of farmers have outgrown their supplies of rain and surface water. Groundwater has come to the rescue, and for a while it seemed a miraculous solution: drill a borehole, pump the stuff up from below and in due course it will be replaced. In some places it is indeed replenished quite quickly if rain or surface water is available and the geological and soil conditions are favourable. In many places, however, from the United States to India and China, the quantities being withdrawn exceed the annual recharge. This is serious for millions of people not just in the country but also in many of the world&#8217;s biggest cities, which often depend on aquifers for their drinking water. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The 20m inhabitants of Mexico City and its surrounding area, for example, draw over 70% of their water from an aquifer that will run dry, at current extraction rates, within 200 years, maybe much sooner. Already the city is sinking as a result. In Bangkok, Buenos Aires and Jakarta, the aquifers are similarly overdrawn, polluted or contaminated by salt. Just as serious is the depletion of the aquifers on which farmers depend. In the Hai river basin in China, for example, deep-groundwater tables have dropped by up to 90 metres.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Part of the beauty of the borehole is that it requires no elaborate apparatus; a single farmer may be able to sink his own tubewell and start pumping. That is why India and China are now perforated with millions of irrigation wells, each drawing on a common resource. Sometimes this resource will be huge: the High Plains aquifer, for example, covers 450,000 square kilometres below eight American states and the Guaran\xED aquifer extends across 1.2m square kilometres below parts of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. But even big aquifers are not immune to the laws of physics. Parts of the High Plains are seriously overdrawn. In the United States, China and many other places, farmers probably have to pay something for the right to draw groundwater. But almost nowhere will the price reflect scarcity, and often there is no charge at all and no one measures how much water is being taken. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Liquid asset or human right?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Priced or not, water is certainly valued, and that value depends on the use to which it is harnessed. Water is used not just to grow food but to make every kind of product, from microchips to steel girders. The largest industrial purpose to which it is put is cooling in thermal power generation, but it is also used in drilling for and extracting oil, the making of petroleum products and ethanol, and the production of hydro-electricity. Some of the processes involved, such as hydro power generation, consume little water (after driving the turbines, most is returned to the river), but some, such as the techniques used to extract oil from sands, are big consumers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Industrial use takes about 60% of water in rich countries and 10% in the rest. The difference in domestic use is much smaller, 11% and 8% respectively. Some of the variation is explained by capacious baths, power showers and flush lavatories in the rich world. All humans, however, need a basic minimum of two litres of water in food or drink each day, and for this there is no substitute. No one survived in the ruins of Port-au-Prince for more than a few days after January&#8217;s earthquake unless they had access to some water-based food or drink. That is why many people in poor and arid countries&#8212;usually women or children&#8212;set off early each morning to trudge to the nearest well and return five or six hours later burdened with precious supplies. That is why many people believe water to be a human right, a necessity more basic than bread or a roof over the head. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From this much follows. One consequence is a widespread belief that no one should have to pay for water. The Byzantine emperor Justinian declared in the sixth century that &#8220;by natural law&#8221; air, running water, the sea and seashore were &#8220;common to all&#8221;. Many Indians agree, seeing groundwater in particular as a &#8220;democratic resource&#8221;. In Africa it is said that &#8220;even the jackal deserves to drink&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A second consequence is that water often has a sacred or mystical quality that is invested in deities like Gong Gong and Osiris and rivers like the Jordan and the Ganges. Throughout history, man&#8217;s dependence on water has made him live near it or organise access to it. Water is in his body&#8212;it makes up about 60%&#8212;and in his soul. It has provided not just life and food but a means of transport, a way of keeping clean, a mechanism for removing sewage, a home for fish and other animals, a medium with which to cook, in which to swim, on which to skate and sail, a thing of beauty to provide inspiration, to gaze upon and to enjoy. No wonder a commodity with so many qualities, uses and associations has proved so difficult to organise. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Enough is not enough</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>It must also be clean</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF WATER has the capacity to enhance life, its absence has the capacity to make it miserable. David Gray, a water practitioner who has served the World Bank in almost every river basin on the globe and is now a professor at Oxford, has a technique that makes the point. Every day he receives e-mails with water stories from newspapers round the world. By briefly displaying to an audience just one day&#8217;s crop&#8212;including, say, drought in Australia, floods in Kenya, an empty dam in Pakistan, a toxic spill in the Yellow river and saltwater contamination in Haiti&#8212;he can soon show how water may dominate if not destroy lives, especially in poor countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of its most pernicious influences, though, never make the headlines. This is how they might read: &#8220;Over 1.2 billion people have to defecate in the open.&#8221; &#8220;The biggest single cause of child deaths is diarrhoea or diseases related to it.&#8221; &#8220;Nearly 1 billion people have no access to piped drinking water or safe taps or wells.&#8221; Each of these statements is linked to water.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Surprisingly, some of those who have to defecate in the open do not mind. Some rural men, and even women, quite enjoy a social squat in the bushes. But for many, and certainly for those who must live with its consequences, it is a disagreeable practice. Women and, especially, girls often find it embarrassing. Many women in South Asia contain themselves by day and wait till nightfall before venturing into the shadows. Girls at African schools without latrines often drop out rather than risk the jeers of their male contemporaries. Slum-dwellers in Nairobi have to pick their way through streams of sewage and take care to avoid &#8220;flying toilets&#8221;, plastic bags filled with excrement that are flung with desperate abandon into the night.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Without piped water to wash their hands with, let alone to drink, the open-air defecators and another 800m people with access only to primitive latrines are inevitably carriers of disease. If they could wash their hands with soap and water, they could block one of the main transmission routes for the spread of both diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections. As it is, patients with water-related diseases fill half the hospital beds in the poorest countries, and dirty water and poor sanitation kill 5,000 children a day.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Clean water is crucial for children with diarrhoea; they need rehydration and electrolytes to survive. Even then, they may still be at risk of malnutrition if they continue to suffer from diarrhoea, which will prevent them from absorbing their food properly. This usually has long-term consequences. Malnutrition in the womb and during the first two years of life is now seen as causing irreversible changes that lead to lifelong poor health. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Poor health, bad in itself, translates into poor economic output. A study in Guatemala followed the lives of children in four villages from their earliest years to ages between 25 and 42. In two villages the children were given a nutritious supplement for their first seven years, and in the other pair a less nutritious one. The boys who had had the more nutritious diet in their first two years were found to have larger bodies, a greater capacity for physical work, more schooling and better cognitive skills. They also grew up to earn average wages 46% higher than the other groups. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The cost to health and wealth</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Studies in Ghana and Pakistan suggest that the long-term impact of malnutrition associated with diarrhoeal infections costs each country 4-5% of GDP. This can be added to a similar burden for &#8220;environmental risk&#8221;, which includes malaria and poor access to water and sanitation, both water- related, as well as indoor air pollution. All in all, the World Health Organisation thinks that half the consequences of malnutrition are caused by inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene. In Ghana and Pakistan the total cost of these shortcomings may amount to 9% of GDP, and these two countries are not unique. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The problem is not strictly a matter of water scarcity. Indeed, expanding the availability of water may actually increase disease, since it may lead to stagnant pools in which mosquitoes breed, and then spread malaria or dengue fever; or perhaps excess water will run through human or toxic waste and thus contaminate the ground or a nearby stream. So hygiene and protected storage are essential. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet there is a shortage of safe water for drinking and sanitation in many places, not least in the cities to which so many people are now flocking. Africa is urbanising faster than any other continent, and most migrants to the towns there find themselves living in slums. In cities like Addis Ababa and Lagos a quarter to a half of the population have no access to decent sanitation, and not many more will have access to piped water. No Indian city has a 24-hour domestic water supply, though efforts are under way to provide it in Mysore and a few other places. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Delhi&#8217;s story is typical. Demand for water there has been rising for years. The local utility cannot meet it. The city&#8217;s pipes and other equipment have been so poorly maintained that 40% of the supply fails to reach the customers. So the utility rations it by providing water for a limited number of hours a day and, in some places, by restricting the quantity. Householders and landlords build tanks, if they can, and fill them when the water is available. Residents, or their weary employees, set their alarm clocks to turn on the tap before the flow dribbles away to nothing. Property developers, anxious to take advantage of a booming economy and a growing middle class, drill boreholes, but these now have to go deeper and deeper to reach water. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As for the Yamuna river, long the main source of the city&#8217;s drinking water, it is clinically dead. Quantities of sewage are poured into it daily, 95% of which is untreated, and it is also a depository for industrial effluents, chemicals from farm runoffs and arsenic and fluoride contamination. The city&#8217;s master plan proposes three new dams, but they will not be finished for several years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many other cities have problems like Delhi&#8217;s, though mostly in less extreme forms. Nearly two-fifths of the United States&#8217; 25,000 sewer systems illegally discharged raw sewage or other nasty stuff into rivers or lakes in 2007-09, and over 40% of the country&#8217;s waters are considered dangerously polluted. Contaminated water lays low almost 20m Americans a year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Pollution, however, is not the reason that people in rich countries have taken to drinking bottled water. In the developing world they do it because that is often the only water fit to drink, and for the poor it is usually a significant expense. Not only are their incomes small, but they often pay a lot more for drinking water than do their richer compatriots. A litre of bottled water in India costs about 15 rupees (35 cents). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bottled water often comes from the same source as tap water, where that is available (sometimes at a hundredth of the price), though it should at least be clean. It is often indistinguishable from tap water. In rich countries, it may have come from exotic sources like Fiji or Lapland, packed in glass or plastic destined to become rubbish, devouring energy on its travels and thus making it one of the least green and least defensible rip-offs on the market.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A concerted international effort is now under way to improve sanitation and the supply of drinking water. One of the development goals set by the United Nations at the millennium was to halve the proportion of people without basic sanitation and a decent source of fresh water by 2015. Progress is slow, especially for sanitation, and particularly in Africa, and increasingly policymakers are finding that heavily subsidised projects are failing. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Sexy loos</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Outfits like the World Toilet Organisation, based in Singapore, now believe you have to make lavatories &#8220;as sexy as mobile phones&#8221; if you are to get people to accept them, and that means literally selling them. Once people have invested some of their own money in a loo, they will use it. The World Bank confirms that the most successful sanitation projects involve only a small subsidy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Where building a fixed latrine is not possible&#8212;slum-dwellers seldom own the land they live on, or have much incentive to improve a site to which they have no legal rights&#8212;entrepreneurs may help out. The Peepoo is a personal, single-use bag that the Swedish founder of the company, Anders Wilhelmsen, describes as the hygienic version of Nairobi&#8217;s flying toilet, intended, to begin with, for the same Kenyan users. Sealed by knotting, it acts as a micro treatment plant to break down the excreta. Since the bag is made of degradable bio-plastic, when it has served its primary purpose it can be sold with its contents as fertiliser. Indeed, the hope is that a market will develop in which the same people will trade in the bags before and after use. Each will sell for 5-7 cents, about the same as a conventional plastic bag, and though a subsidy will be needed at first, the operation is meant to become self-sustaining, and indeed profitable.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Private enterprise also has a role in the provision of safe drinking water. A large market in home water-purifiers now exists all over the world. But a typical one, using reverse osmosis, may cost at least $170 in a country like India. Kevin McGovern, a self-described pro bono capitalist from New York, wants to bring cheaper purifiers to the poor. His company, the Water Initiative, has developed a filtering device that takes all the nasties out of water in the home and needs to be replaced only once a year. Unlike osmosis, it consumes no energy, and every drop of incoming water can be used for drinking. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first country Mr McGovern has in his sights is Mexico, the second-biggest consumer of bottled water in the world because of the high incidence of arsenic, fluoride and pathogens in the water. Mr McGovern hopes to put in place a distribution system with a commercial interest in providing the machines and selling the filters. Volunteers and NGOs, he says, tend to set things up and then move on; a local commercial incentive is needed to sustain the operation, even if subsidies are required to get it started. Fortunately, two Mexican organisations have already promised grants, and the project is backed by the country&#8217;s popular first lady, Margarita Zavala. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Business begins to stir</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>But many water providers still have a long way to go</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ALTHOUGH water is a universal human requirement, the use people make of it varies hugely. The average Malian draws 4 cubic metres a year for domestic use, the average American 215. Include all uses, and the figures range from 20 cubic metres for the average Ugandan to over 5,000 for his Turkmenistani counterpart. The statistics can be misleading: in places where rain falls copiously and evenly from the skies, withdrawals will be small. Moreover, water-blessed countries have much less reason to be careful with their resources than the water-starved. Yet high use of water is not necessarily bad. It depends how it is employed, and whether it is naturally replaced. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However essential, farming is not the most lucrative use of water. Industry generates about 70 times as much value from a litre of water as agriculture, which helps to explain why industry takes the lion&#8217;s share in most rich countries. Yet the ratio of water use to GDP has declined dramatically in many rich and middle-income countries in recent decades, which suggests that industry can use water much more productively if it tries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Unilever, a seller of soaps to soups in 170 countries, boasts that its Medusa project, formulated in Brazil in 2003, cut its total water use by 8% and reduced the load per tonne of production by 15%. SABMiller, which brews all over the world, has embarked on a programme to save a quarter of the water needed to make a litre of beer by 2015. Nestl\xE9, which aims to be the most efficient water user among food manufacturers, has cut water withdrawals by a third since 2000 even though the volume of the foods and drinks it makes has risen by 60%. Cisco, which supplies internet routers, switches and the like, uses recycled water in its gardens and fountains in California and has installed waterless urinals and low-flow showers in its buildings.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such measures make good financial sense and good public relations. Some of the companies at the forefront of water-saving campaigns are also acutely aware of their vulnerability to the growing scarcity of water, and to charges that they are guzzlers. Coca-Cola, for example, has been fiercely attacked in India for its dependence on groundwater and the effects on the water table. Yet even if it takes two litres of groundwater to produce a litre of bottled water, companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are hardly significant users compared with farmers and even many industrial producers</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> PepsiCo has nevertheless become the first big company to declare its support for the human right to water. For its part, Coca-Cola is one of a consortium of companies that in 2008 formed the 2030 Water Resources Group, which strives to deal with the issue of water scarcity. Last year it commissioned a consultancy, McKinsey, to produce a report on the economics of a range of solutions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In China, where pollution rivals scarcity as a pressing problem, large foreign companies now regularly consult a website run by the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, an NGO that collects government facts and statistics and publishes them online. Its maps reveal details of thousands of incidents in which companies have broken the pollution codes. Multinationals like Adidas, General Electric, Nike and Wal-Mart can now see which of their suppliers are repeat offenders, and may put pressure on them to clean up. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not all big companies are water-conscious, though, even if they are big users. A report issued this year by Ceres, a coalition of American investors, found that &#8220;the vast majority of leading companies in water-intensive industries have weak management and disclosure of water-related risks and opportunities.&#8221; Less than half the electric-power companies surveyed even provided data on total water withdrawals.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, companies like Coca-Cola and Nestl\xE9 are being joined by others who are worried about being cast as villains. At the same time more and more companies are bringing forward new products and technologies designed to save water. These vary from genetically modified crop varieties that are drought-resistant to technologies that replace chemicals with eco-friendly enzymes in the making of knitwear; from low-lather detergents (which use less water) to dual-flush lavatories; from lasers that detect the amount of moisture in the air above crops to wireless devices that help reduce the water needed on golf courses (which account for 0.5% of America&#8217;s annual water use, though some must help recharge aquifers).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Desalination is the great hope. The conventional method involves boiling and then distilling water. An alternative works by reverse osmosis, in which water is forced through a semi-permeable membrane. Both methods use quite a lot of energy. New membranes now being developed need less power, and new techniques require neither evaporation nor membranes nor futuristic nanotubes (undesirable in your drinking water).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Reverse osmosis is the most favoured method, though, and in Israel and Algeria contracts have been signed for salt-free water at about 55 cents a cubic metre. Even lower prices have been cited elsewhere, but they do not usually reflect current energy costs or, increasingly, the non-energy costs of desalination. When it was mainly rich Gulf states and ocean liners that removed salt from sea water, ecological and financing concerns were generally overlooked. With desalination now favoured in places like Australia, California and Spain, those considerations have become more important. The city of Sydney, for instance, has had to install elaborate disposal systems for the briny waste of its desalination plant and use wind power in order to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>. All this is expensive.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>A no-briner?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even so, several countries are going ahead, and Spain, the European Union&#8217;s driest country, uses some desalinated seawater to irrigate high-value crops in its driest province, Almer\xEDa. But its choice of desalination goes back to 2004, when it abandoned a hugely expensive and controversial scheme to divert water from the Ebro river in the north to the arid south. In general, people go for desalination when they have few other options and are able to bear the costs. That explains why both new capacity and investment in desalination plants have actually fallen since 2007, though Christopher Gasson of Global Water Intelligence expects them to rise this year. The hope is that, in the long run, solar power will make desalination economic.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In parts of Australia and America irrigation is becoming a sophisticated business in other ways. The gadgets involved may be computerised gates that control canal water, fancy flow meters or huge machines that sprinkle water sparingly from rotating pipes. And in time farmers and others everywhere should be able to take advantage of technology that measures evapotranspiration field by field.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> This is already used by water-management agencies in the American West, thanks to a system developed by the Idaho state water department and the University of Idaho, which calculates the consumption of water from two Landsat satellites orbiting the Earth. Indeed, the use of sensors to take measurements from space is developing apace. The information they provide, perhaps conveyed straight to a farmer&#8217;s mobile phone, should before long enable him to take intelligent decisions about how, when and where to grow his crops, even if he is scarcely literate.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His urban counterparts, and the utilities that serve them, may seem unimportant in terms of the amounts of water they use and lose. But domestic water supplies, though relatively small in volume, are expensive both to treat and to deliver. Water losses therefore matter, even if they help to replenish aquifers. And financial losses matter, too, because they discourage investment and encourage subsidies, which tend to benefit the better off, not the poor.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The utilities&#8217; reaction to water scarcity has been mixed. Many, including the World Bank, once believed that privatisation was the solution to the inefficient provision of water, but the new consensus, certainly in the bank, is that the crucial feature of any system is that it should be sensitive to its customers&#8217; needs. Thus, in Africa, both Senegal and Uganda are judged to have well-run utilities, but Senegal&#8217;s is private-sector whereas Uganda&#8217;s is public. In general, Africa&#8217;s utilities work better than, say, India&#8217;s, largely because in Africa central governments are ready to give autonomy to professionals. In India water power lies with the states, often in huge, torpid, overstaffed and underfinanced bureaucracies. Vast quantities of water escape through leaking pipes; prices are unrelated to costs; meters are broken; and no effort is made to collect revenues. Accordingly, no money is available for repairs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China has brought in private water companies on a large scale, many of them foreign, and they have prospered there. In other places they have not always been a success. Some have suffered because the incoming company has accepted responsibility for the utility&#8217;s foreign-currency debt, and then suffered exchange-rate losses that it had little choice but to pass on to customers. This happened in Cochabamba, a Bolivian town riven by water riots in 2000. It also happened to a company that took on one of two concessions in Manila, which duly foundered. The company that won the other concession, however, was largely free of exchange-rate liabilities and has proved expansively successful. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Often the provision of water ranks too low among politicians&#8217; interests to make them do much. They would rather keep charges low or, in some places, non-existent than spend money on new pipes or treatment plants. They also see no votes in cutting the ribbon outside a new public lavatory. The result is that many utilities, especially in India, have spent so little on maintenance and new investment that the provision of water is, <em>faute de mieux</em>, privatised. Thus the better off sink wells or fill their cisterns with deliveries from tankers, and the poor drink water bought in bottles and wash with whatever they can find.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Luckily, there are exceptions in places like Brazil, where simple sewers built cheaply in some <em>favelas</em> are proving highly effective. Entrepreneurs are also coming into the market with low-tech products. In Tanzania, masons will provide a concrete slab to install above a pit latrine for $5. In Cambodia $30 should buy you a flush lavatory of sorts; and in Indonesia a range of sanitary fixtures sell for $18-90, and may even come with a warranty. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To get service from bad utilities, though, it is sometimes necessary to shame them. One way of doing this is to publicise their position in the rankings of the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation, published online. This is now causing several city governments some embarrassment&#8212;and at the same time giving hope to their ill-served customers. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>And in Singapore every drop is counted</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NO COUNTRY manages its water as well as Singapore. Admittedly, it has high rainfall and it is a tiny country, but that is exactly the trouble. As an island-city-state, it has little land on which to collect enough water for its 4.8m people, and not much room to store it. To supplement its bounty from above, it takes the salt out of sea water and imports supplies from Malaysia. But relations with its big neighbour are often strained; the two treaties under which the water is provided, both about 50 years old, will expire in 2011 and 2061 respectively; and Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the nation, has never forgotten that the invading Japanese blew up the water pipeline when they seized Singapore in 1942. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The first measure taken to escape foreign dependency in the years after independence in 1965 was a general tidy-up. Industry and commerce were shifted into estates and messy pig and duck farms closed down. That made it easier to purify the rainwater that in Singapore is fastidiously collected wherever it can be&#8212;in streets and ponds, even on tall buildings and bridges&#8212;before being taken by drains to reservoirs, and thence to treatment plants where it is cleaned to drinking-water standards. The catchment area is being increased by the creation of a pair of reservoirs, the first of which, due to be finished next year, will mean the rainfall-catchment acreage will extend to two-thirds of the island&#8217;s total land area. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Little is wasted in Singapore. Used water is treated and then either safely disposed of, reused for industrial purposes or air-conditioning, or mixed with reservoir water for drinking. Together, recycled waste and desalinated water are expected soon to meet 25-30% of demand, and local industries, many of them with a need for the cleanest supplies, are more than happy to use it. Most of the discarded sewage, once treated, is carried 5km out to sea.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Demand is also being contained. Subjected to constant water-consciousness campaigns, Singaporeans are obliged to install low-use taps and loos, and expected to be equally thrifty with their showers and washing-machines. As a result, domestic water use per person has fallen from 165 litres a day in 2003 to 155 today. The pricing system also encourages virtue. Both the tariff and the water-conservation tax rise for domestic users after the first 40 cubic metres a month, and there is a fee for various sanitary appliances. Industry faces much higher charges. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> How is all this achieved? The most important ingredient is a sense of seriousness about water at the highest levels of government and a society that is generally regarded as pretty free of corruption. Then comes an autonomous water authority, professionally run by excellent, highly paid professionals (the boss is said to receive $700,000 a year). They are not afraid to bring in private-sector partners, and do what they believe needs doing, not what politicians want done. So money is invested in everything from dams and drains to membranes and bioreactors. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Singapore&#8217;s water industry&#8212;over 50 companies, both local and foreign&#8212;is now thriving. Nanyang Technological University has three water-related units, and Singaporean companies are winning contracts in such countries as Qatar and Algeria. Singaporeans still import 40% of their needs. Even so, they have a supply of water that is clean, predictably delivered and reasonably secure. Sixty years ago they had floods, pollution and rationing. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>And monitor, budget, manage&#8212;and prosper</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>OF ALL the activities that need water, far and away the thirstiest is farming. Cut the use of irrigation water by 10%, it is said, and you would save more than is lost in evaporation by all other consumers. Yet farming is crucial. Not only does it provide the food that all mankind requires, but it is also a great engine of economic growth for the three-quarters of the world&#8217;s poor who live in the countryside. Without water they may return to pastoralism&#8212;as some people already have in parts of the Sahel in Africa&#8212;or migrate, or starve. With water, they may fight their way out of poverty.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Surface water, though, is not enough to meet farmers&#8217; needs. In the United States total withdrawals of water remained steady between 1985 and 2000 but groundwater withdrawals rose by 14%, mainly for agriculture, and in the period 1950-2000 they more than doubled. This was not all for the arid West. Midwestern Nebraska now ranks above California and Texas as America&#8217;s most irrigated state. Europe, too, increasingly relies on groundwater, as does the Middle East. In a network of pipes that Colonel Muammar Qaddafi has called the eighth wonder of the world, Libya is drawing fossil water that has lain undisturbed for centuries. Many hydrologists think it will be all but exhausted in 40 years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is India, though, that draws more groundwater than any other country. The 230 cubic kilometres that it pumps each year account for over a quarter of the world total. The tripling of Indian groundwater use since 1965 has been stimulated not just by growing demand for food but also by the lamentable public service provided by state governments and the relative cheapness and convenience of a private tubewell. By 2001 India had about 17m of these (and Pakistan 930,000 and Bangladesh 1.2m). The pumps for the wells are usually cheap to run because electricity is subsidised in most places, and in some it is free, though at times it is not provided at all; that is how water is rationed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The proliferation has brought prosperity and an almost lush landscape to places like Punjab, which grows over half of India&#8217;s rice and wheat. But out of sight, underground, there is trouble. Water is being extracted faster than it is replaced and levels are falling, often by two or three times the officially reported rate, according to Upmanu Lall, of Columbia University. The World Bank says the groundwater in 75% of the blocks into which Punjab is divided is overdrawn. Over half the blocks of five other states&#8212;Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu&#8212;are judged to be in a critical or semi-critical condition, or are similarly over-exploited.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Up comes the poison</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> One consequence is that the water now being pumped is often salty and sometimes high in concentrations of naturally occurring poisons like arsenic, fluorides and uranium. In the village of Bhutal Kalan in Sangrur district, for instance, the farmers complain not just of water levels dropping by two metres after each of the two harvests a year but also of fluorosis, which may cause mottling of the teeth and skin, or, in its skeletal form, arthritic pain and bone deformities. Cancer is also rising, which the farmers blame on the natural poisons and on pesticides, which they apply specially heavily if they grow cotton.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The farmers&#8217; woes do not end there. Though part of the Sangrur district suffers from a falling water table, the other part suffers from waterlogging. This is a common problem when poorly drained soil is over-irrigated, which results in plants&#8217; roots being starved of oxygen, knocking perhaps 20% off a field&#8217;s productivity. Sometimes standing water will evaporate, leaving the soil salty as well as saturated.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tushaar Shah, in &#8220;Taming the Anarchy&#8221;, his book on water in South Asia, says the groundwater irrigation boom in India is &#8220;silently reconfiguring&#8221; entire river basins. But of more immediate concern to the farmers are the economic and social consequences of overdrawing groundwater: falling yields, higher electricity costs, ever greater debts, even rising crime among the unemployed. Increasingly, say the farmers, they must look to other, part-time jobs, like driving a taxi. Or they must sell their land. Usually it will go to a village bigwig, perhaps with a little help from local officials. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The main winners, though, are the <em>arhtiyas</em>, the commission agents who act as middlemen between farmers and wholesale buyers and at the same time moonlight, sometimes extortionately, as moneylenders. Few farmers, big or small, are free of debt, and worries about interest payments have driven thousands of Indian farmers to suicide in recent years, many more than the official figures suggest, says Chander Parkash, an academic who helps to run a local NGO for farmers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Back in Delhi, Himanshu Thakkar, of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, casts a more dispassionate eye over the Indian water scene. In Punjab he discerns a state hooked on irrigation. Reluctant to share its river waters with other states, it has passed laws to cancel earlier inter-state agreements. Its depletion of the aquifer also robs its neighbours in the Indus basin. Yet Punjab&#8217;s farmers benefit from (state or central) government spending on dams and canals; on help with inputs such as new seeds and fertilisers; on the security of a guaranteed support price for their produce; and on subsidies for electricity (which is in effect free). Lastly, in Punjab at least, the water pumped is not even metered, let alone paid for.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Down in the south-east, Andhra Pradesh also sees its groundwater disappearing. But unlike Punjab, whose alluvial aquifers in equilibrium are recharged by monsoonal rain and leakage from irrigation canals, Andhra Pradesh relies entirely on the monsoon for its groundwater replenishment. Moreover, since it sits on hard rock, only about 12% of the annual rainfall goes to recharge the aquifers, compared with perhaps 30% in Punjab, and subterranean water tends to run away into rivers after a month or two, so underground storage is limited. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Out in the arid west of the state, drought is almost the normal condition and, for the first time in India, a large number of farmers are starting to deal with it by reducing their demand rather than by pumping more and more from deeper and deeper. The idea behind a project that now involves nearly 1m people in 650 villages is to monitor, demystify and thus manage groundwater. The nine NGOs that run the scheme offer no subsidies, just knowledge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> At Mutyalapadu and round about, this comes from the Rev V. Paul Raja Rao&#8217;s Bharati Integrated Rural Development Society, which also runs a clinic, an orphanage and a microcredit organisation. One of the first water-management tasks for an organisation such as this is to map the locality and define its hydrological units, each of which is an area drained by a single stream with one inlet and one outlet. The region encompasses 11 hydrological units, one containing 41 villages. Some are much smaller.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The farmers taking part in the project measure and record rainfall, the water table, withdrawals and other data for their land. They calculate how much water will be available if the table is not to fall, decide which crops to grow and estimate how much water they will use, bearing in mind that about half will go in evapotranspiration. They then sit down together in a group&#8212;there are several of these for each hydrological unit&#8212;and draw up a water budget. Details of the eventual agreement, showing who should grow what and how, are displayed on a wall in the village and updated over the year with information about rain, harvests and even revenues.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No one is compelled to take part; the enterprise is voluntary and collaborative. But so far most farmers, and their families, seem pleased. The local diet has become more varied, since 13 crops are now grown in the area, compared with eight in the past. Those that need most water&#8212; bananas, rice and cotton&#8212;have yielded to others that need less, such as peanuts and a locally bred variety of green lentils. Chemical fertilisers have been replaced by compost, a change welcomed for both health and financial reasons. Mulch, manure and organic weedkillers are also used. The upshot is that although incomes have not risen&#8212;most of the crop is eaten, not sold for cash&#8212;the cost of inputs has fallen and those involved feel they are engaged in a sustainable activity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> That is because the scheme puts the people who invest the money, grow the crops and live or die by their efforts in charge of their most crucial resource; they are all barefoot hydrogeologists. The relentless drilling of wells has abated: in two units near Mutyalapadu no new wells were bored over two recent seasons, and in the wider region only eight out of 58 units showed no reduction in pumping. Overdrawing is judged to be under control, partly because everyone knows what is happening. And the idea is catching on. The entire water department of Andhra Pradesh has been trained in the basic principles; Maharashtra has three similar projects under way; and Gujarat, Orissa and Tamil Nadu are keen to follow suit. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>China's peasants look to the skies</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>But the science of yields is unyielding</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF THE Andhra Pradesh principles point the way to a reasonably equable future, they will have to be adopted not only throughout South Asia but also in China, where the water available to each person is only a quarter of the world average. In the rain-starved north, the availability per person is only a quarter of that in the south. Yet this is where almost half China&#8217;s population lives, and where most of its maize, wheat and vegetables are grown.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Water scarcity is hardly new in China, whose irrigation records go back 4,000 years, but the use of groundwater is. In the 1950s this was virtually unknown in the north. Today there are more wells there than anywhere else in the world, and they are relentlessly pumped, with alarming results. For instance, in the Hai river basin, in which both Beijing and Tianjin lie, shallow water tables have dropped by up to 50 metres, deep ones by up to 90. These will not quickly be put right. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Chinese governments have usually responded to shortages with canals, dykes, storage ponds and so on. The 1,800km Grand Canal, started in 486BC, was built chiefly to move grain to the capital, but will now become part of the great South-North Water-Transfer Project, intended to slake the thirst of China&#8217;s arid regions. Dams and canals appeal to the engineers who are disproportionately represented in China&#8217;s government. And the country&#8217;s engineers are still taught that the way to &#8220;save&#8221; water is to improve the way it is delivered&#8212;by lining irrigation canals, for instance, or laying pipes&#8212;to reduce the water that is &#8220;lost&#8221; by seeping into the soil.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In truth, though, such water is not all lost: much of it returns to the aquifers below, from where it can be pumped up again. There is a cost to this, in energy and therefore cash, but not in water. The only water truly lost in a hydrologic system is through evapotranspiration, since no one can make further use of it once it is in the atmosphere. If genuine savings are to be made, either evaporation must be cut (for example, by storing water underground, or by delivering it to plants&#8217; roots under the surface of the soil); or food must be produced with less transpiration.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The trouble with efficiency savings</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Almost all China&#8217;s (and others&#8217;) attempts at using groundwater more efficiently so far have foundered on a failure to grasp these facts. The water &#8220;saved&#8221; by sprinklers, lined canals and other forms of seepage control has simply been used to expand the area under irrigation. Over the past 30 years this has gone up by 8m hectares, allowing food production to increase even though the amount of pumped water has remained much the same. But ET has risen, so aquifer depletion has continued.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Sometimes, say Frank Ward, of New Mexico State University, and Manuel Pulido-Vel\xE1zquez, of the Technical University of Valencia, policies aimed at reducing water use can actually increase groundwater depletion. This has happened in the Upper Rio Grande basin shared by the United States and Mexico, where measures designed to achieve more efficient irrigation have led to an increase in yields upstream; this in turn has increased ET, leaving less water available for aquifer recharge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such discoveries increase the attractiveness of demand management, and that is being tried in China as well as in Andhra Pradesh. In a project that covers several parts of arid and semi-arid China&#8212;Beijing, Hebei, Qingdao and Shenyang, as well as the Hai basin and the smaller Turpan basin&#8212;the World Bank has been promoting water conservation. Elements of the approach are similar to that in Andhra Pradesh: farmers gather in water-users&#8217; associations to plan and operate irrigation services, for example. But the aim here is specifically to reduce ET, at the same time increasing farmers&#8217; incomes without depleting the groundwater. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is high-tech stuff that involves not just drip irrigation and condensation-trapping greenhouses, but remote sensing by satellites which provide ET readings for areas of 30 by 30 metres. This tells farmers how much water they can consume without adversely affecting the ecosystems in their river basin. If the project is successful, as a pilot has been, it will also establish the use of an internet-based management system, mitigate losses from flooding and increase the supply of water to industry. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> If such practices were extended across Asia, groundwater depletions might well be arrested. With luck, farmers too would be better off. But would they produce enough food for the extra 2.5 billion people expected by 2050 in today&#8217;s developing countries? The constraints seem to be set by science, and they are tight. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Growing more crops over a wider area leads to more ET. The yield of a crop can be increased a bit by giving plants only as much water as they need and no more; but, says Dr Perry, the water accountant, the productivity gains are unlikely to exceed 10%. Increases in biomass&#8212;total vegetative matter&#8212;are matched almost proportionately by increases in transpiration, unless humidity or nutrients are changed or the plant is modified genetically. But so far, he notes, &#8220;the fundamental relationship between biomass and transpiration has not been changed.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The ups and downs of dams</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Small projects often give better returns</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE trouble with water is that it is all politics, no economics. The costs of poor management are large: groundwater depletion takes 2.1% off Jordan&#8217;s GDP; water pollution and scarcity knock 2.3% off China&#8217;s; 11% of Kenya&#8217;s was lost to flooding in 1997-98, and 16% to drought in the next two years. Rich countries build sewers, drains, dams, reservoirs, flood defences, irrigation canals and barrages to avoid such problems. Poor countries, with some exceptions, notably China, find large projects much more difficult. But at least large projects give politicians a monument to boast about. Small projects&#8212;weirs and wells and waterworks&#8212;have no allure for big-headed politicians. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> That is a pity. A small dam is relatively cheap to construct: modest reservoirs known in India as tanks used to be built and maintained by local villagers. For a millennium they provided water in times of need and helped make rulers like the nizams of Hyderabad some of the richest men in the world. Now they are often silted up, polluted with pesticides, metals and phosphorus, or built on. In Kenya, by contrast, small dams are coming into fashion. Rainwater is channelled into sand catchments, which serve both to filter it and to protect it from evaporation. Some goes into nearby soil, for crops, some into groundwater from which it can later be recovered. In Niger a 15-year project involving dams and reclamation has restored nearly 20,000 hectares of unproductive land to forestry or agricultural use.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Everyone loves projects like these, especially if they can be given a romantic name like water harvesting. Some, perhaps, may simply be intercepting water for one user that would otherwise have gone to another, but almost every country could reduce its evaporation losses by capturing water and delivering it more effectively to the farmer, bather, drinker or manufacturer&#8212;and then, ideally, using it again. The harder question is whether that is enough.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many believe it is not. Throughout history, man has made efforts to control water, divert it by means of canals, carry it via aqueducts, store it in reservoirs, harness it with water wheels and so on. The costs of these endeavours have been huge: valleys flooded, villages and habitats destroyed, wetlands drained and inland seas reduced to mere puddles. But the benefits have also been enormous. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Aswan high dam, for example, is often cited as a cautionary example, a quixotic construction that now reduces the mighty Nile to a dribble before it trickles to the sea, leaving behind an explosion of water hyacinth, outbreaks of bilharzia, polluted irrigation channels and a build-up of sediment inland that would otherwise compensate for coastal erosion from Egypt to Lebanon. Yet, according to the World Bank, it has provided a bulwark against flooding for buildings and crops, a huge expansion of farming and Nile navigation (lots of tourism) and enough electricity for the whole of Egypt&#8212;all of which amounts to the equivalent each year of 2% of GDP in net benefits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So would the World Bank today lend money for an Aswan dam if it did not already exist? The bank has been involved in few of the 200 or so large dams built in the past five years, but that is mainly because dam-builders&#8212;of which China is much the biggest&#8212;do not care for the bank&#8217;s time- and money-consuming regulations, designed to ensure decent technical, social and environmental standards. Their strictness partly reflects greater knowledge about the consequences of building dams, partly the related political controversies of the 1980s. Even so, the bank was involved in 101 dam and hydro projects in 2007, up from 89 in 1997 and 76 in 2003; and it approved over $800m in hydro lending in 2008, up from $250m in 2002. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Suspicions of big dams still run high&#8212;and with some reason. Mr Thakkar, scrutineer of the Indian water scene, says that although the installed capacity of India&#8217;s hydro projects increased at a compound rate of 4.4% a year between 1991 and 2005, the amount of energy generated actually fell. Some of the projects, poorly sited or poorly designed, were doomed to be uneconomic from the start. Others have been badly maintained or have simply silted up. But though 89% of the country&#8217;s hydro projects operate below design capacity, the building continues wastefully apace.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Thakkar argues that small projects offer much better returns, even for the crucial task of refilling aquifers by capturing monsoon rainfall. He points to the success of micro-irrigation in semi-arid Gujarat, whose agriculture has grown at an average of 9.6% a year since the turn of the century, partly thanks to the creation of 500,000 small ponds, dams and suchlike. But India, says Mr Thakkar, is still obsessed with big projects like the Bhakhra dam that the country&#8217;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, saw as one of the &#8220;temples&#8221; of Indian modernity. Only when the small temples can no longer provide solutions does he see a need for big ones.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not all the big temples are dams. India has a dormant but not dead $120 billion scheme to bring &#8220;surplus&#8221; water from north to south by linking up the country&#8217;s main rivers. China has its south-north equivalent, which, if it comes to pass, may involve spending $62 billion and shifting 250,000 people. Spain had its Ebro scheme, involving 830km of waterways, now abandoned, though some Spaniards remain wistful. Each of these has, or had, beguiling attractions, but vast costs.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Big can also be beautiful</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Dams and reservoirs certainly need constant repairs and careful maintenance and do not always get them, usually because the necessary institutions are not in place. But when they are, a well-sited dam or embankment can transform lives for the better. In the late 1970s John Briscoe, an old water hand at the World Bank who is now at Harvard, spent a year in a Bangladeshi village and predicted terrible consequences if a proposed flood-control and irrigation scheme were to go ahead. It did, but on his return 22 years later he found the new embankment had vastly improved every aspect of the villagers&#8217; lives. He became an advocate of large projects.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the rich world these are now largely unnecessary; the damage has been done and the benefits are being reaped. Southern California is an example, a region that gets all its water expensively from either the north of the state or the Colorado, a river so dammed and drained that it dies long before it reaches its delta&#8212;7,500 square kilometres of wetlands formerly crammed with wildlife, now invaded by the salty Pacific. But Hollywood survives, and in it such environmentalists as James Cameron, the director of &#8220;Avatar&#8221; and new champion of the Amazonian opponents of the planned Belo Monte dam in Brazil.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Many Ethiopians would be happy to have a few dams. Their GDP rises and falls in near synch with their rainfall, which varies wildly from year to year. If they had more storage, they could use it to get through the country&#8217;s frequent droughts, but their man-made storage amounts to only 30 cubic metres per person, compared with 6,000 in the United States. Ethiopia&#8217;s electricity consumption per person is among the lowest in the world, whereas its potential for hydro power is one of the highest. Indeed, electricity could be a valuable export. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Africa as a whole stands to benefit from more hydro projects, large and small. Climate change seems likely to shorten the rainy seasons and intensify variability, making storage even more important. Moreover, Africa seems likely to suffer more from climate change than other continents. As it is, it contains 35 of the 45 most &#8220;water-stressed&#8221; countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Hydro generation uses a known and tested technology that neither adds directly to greenhouse gases nor produces nuclear waste. Last month the World Bank announced a controversial $3.75 billion loan for a coal-fired plant in South Africa. Some hydro projects might be no more unpopular. Congo&#8217;s Inga dams, for example, have the potential to provide the equivalent of South Africa&#8217;s existing capacity. The South African authorities would be pleased to have it today. Their fingers are crossed that the hydro power from Mozambique will not cut out during the football World Cup next month. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>How to make tight supplies go further</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF MOST governments are bad at making wise investment decisions about water, that is largely because they are bad at evaluating the costs and benefits, and that in turn is at least partly because they find it hard to price water. Many find it hard even to measure. Yet you cannot manage what you cannot measure.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No country uses water pricing to achieve a balance between supply and demand, but countries with sustainable systems all use water rights of some kind that involve the allocation of supply by volume. In a country such as India, which has over 20m well-users, even the registration of wells would be a long and difficult task, as the World Bank points out, never mind measuring the water drawn from each of them. Moreover, introducing a system in which price reflected some sort of cost would often be politically impossible except over time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Perry, the irrigation economist, says water is typically priced at 10-50% of the costs of operating and maintaining the system, and that in turn is only 10-50% of what water is worth in terms of agricultural productivity. So to bring supply and demand into equilibrium the price would have to rise by 4-100 times. In most countries that would spell electoral suicide, or revolution. That is why community management of the Andhra Pradesh or Chinese kind, which may involve a mix of instruments including regulation, property rights and pricing, offers the best hope. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In the long run it is hard to see sustainable arrangements that do not involve property rights. These can be traded between willing buyers and willing sellers to reallocate water from low-value to high-value uses, and they have proved their worth in the American West, Chile and South Africa. Their most fashionable exemplar is the Murray-Darling basin in Australia, where they have enabled farmers to withstand a fearsome drought without much impact on agricultural production.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet water rights do not provide an easy or quick fix to water shortages. For a start, they usually require tested institutions and the ability to ensure fair trading that may take years to establish. Then the scheme, and particularly the assignment of rights, must be carefully designed. Experience in Australia and Chile shows this can be difficult; indeed, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says there is now widespread recognition that the Murray-Darling system is over- allocated. Spain, which after 20 years has registered less than a quarter of its groundwater structures, shows that this can take a long time. And Yemen shows that trading in the absence of proper regulation can actually add to groundwater depletion, as has happened around the city of Ta&#8217;iz. Lastly, farmers may be resistant to tradable rights. Even Israel, hyper-conservation-conscious in water matters, still allocates water centrally among different sectors, and controls use within sectors by permits and pricing. Rights provide quotas, but Israeli farmers do not want to see them traded&#8212;and the water table drops. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Above all, it is difficult to include small groundwater-users in a tradable-rights scheme. Nebraska neglects small users, as does Australia. But to do so in India would exclude 95% of the people pumping water. This reinforces the argument for collaborative self-policing of withdrawals by farmers themselves.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Comparative advantage</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Plainly, however, that is not going to happen fast, so other solutions are needed. One would be trade. Just as an efficient local trading system should direct water to high-value uses, so an efficient international one should encourage the manufacture of water-heavy products in wet countries and their export to drier ones.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It is not, of course, instantly obvious that some products are lighter or heavier than others in terms of the water embedded in them, yet the amount of this &#8220;virtual&#8221; water can be calculated and a water &#8220;footprint&#8221; sketched for almost any product, person, industry or country. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the back of the business card handed out by Tony Allan, the father of the concept, are the virtual-water values of various products: 70 litres for an apple, 1,000 for a litre of milk, 11,000 for a kilo of cotton, and so on. The value for a copy of <em>The Economist</em> is not included, but it has been calculated by the Green Press Initiative at about 11\xBD litres. That is little more than the 10 litres Mr Allan has for a single sheet of A4 paper, which suggests the exercise is inexact. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It can also be misleading. The oft-quoted figures of 2,400 litres for a hamburger and 15,500 for a kilo of beef lead to the conclusion that eating cows must be unconscionable. Yet some cows valued primarily for their milk may still end up on a plate, and others may be well suited to graze on grassland that would be useless for growing cash crops. In Africa a kilo of beef can be produced with as little as 146 litres of water. Moreover, virtual-water content will vary according to climate and agricultural practice. SABMiller uses 45 litres of water to make a litre of beer in the Czech Republic, but 155 litres in South Africa. In other words, the merit of virtual water is not to give precise figures but to alert people that they might be better off growing different crops, or moving their manufacturing to another country.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Or trading. If the virtual water in traded goods were properly valued and priced, exporters would be fully compensated and importers would pay a price that reflected all the costs. But water is everywhere hugely subsidised, and protectionism often stops an efficient allocation of resources. State laws in America, for instance, usually restrict foreign investment in agricultural land. The upshot, at its most absurd, has been Saudi Arabia&#8217;s decision to use its finite fossil fuel and fossil water to irrigate the desert for wheat that could be grown with less energy and less evapotranspiration in the American Midwest and then exported to the Middle East.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Unfortunately, Henry Kissinger once raised the thought that America might use its food aid as a weapon. More recently, when food prices shot up in 2008, some countries started to impose export bans or taxes, leading importers to hanker for self-sufficiency. Virtual water seems destined to remain an indicator of distorted allocation for some time to come. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>How to avoid water wars</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SINCE men fight over land and oil and plenty of other things, it would be odd if they did not also fight over a commodity as precious and scarce as water. And they do. The Pacific Institute in California has drawn up a list of conflicts in which water has played a part. It starts with a legendary, Noah-and-the-flood-like episode about 3000BC in which the Sumerian god Ea punished the Earth with a storm, and ends, 202 incidents later, with clashes in Mumbai prompted by water rationing last year. Pundits delight in predicting the outbreak of water wars, and certainly water has sometimes been involved in military rows. But so far there have been no true water wars.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Could that change as populations grow, climates change and water becomes ever scarcer? Since 61 of the 203 incidents have taken place in the past ten years, a trend might seem to be in the making&#8212;especially as some recent water disputes fail to make the list even though their results look grave. One example is the competition for water in Bharatpur, a district of the Indian state of Rajasthan, which has led local farmers to cut off water supplies to the Keoladeo national park. This was, until a few years ago, a wonderful wetland, teeming with waders and wildfowl. Thousands of rare birds would winter there, endangered Siberian cranes among them. Now it is a cattle pasture. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China abounds with instances of water-induced disputation. The people of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, are far from happy that their water is now taken to supply the capital in a canal that will eventually form part of the South-North Water-Transfer Project. So are others affected by that grandiose scheme. Dai Qing, an investigative journalist who is an outspoken critic of the Three Gorges dam and other Chinese water projects, draws attention, for example, to the complaints of those living along the Han river, who will lose water to the huge reservoir formed by the Danjiangkou dam. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Similar disgruntlement can be seen in India, where over 40 tribunals and other panels have been set up to deal with disputes, mostly without success. The bone of contention is often a river, such as the Cauvery, whose waters must be shared by several states. Strikes and violent protests are common. Indians, however, have yet to reach the levels of outrage that led Arizona to call out its National Guard in 1935 and station militia units on its border with California in protest at diversions from the Colorado river. To this day, American states regard each other with suspicion where water is concerned. Indian states are equally mistrustful, often refusing to share such water information as they have lest it be used to their disadvantage. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Violent incidents over wells and springs take place periodically in Yemen, and the long-running civil war in Darfur is at least partly attributable to the chronic scarcity of water in western Sudan. That is probably the nearest thing to a real water war being fought today, and may perhaps be a portent of others to come. If so, they will be dangerous, because so many water disagreements are not internal but international affairs. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Arid disputes</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The world has already had a taste of some. The six-day war in the Middle East in 1967, for example, was partly prompted by Jordan&#8217;s proposal to divert the Jordan river, and water remains a divisive issue between Israel and its neighbours to this day. Israel extracts about 65% of the upper Jordan, leaving the occupied West Bank dependent on a brackish trickle and a mountain aquifer, access to which Israel also controls. In 2004 the average Israeli had a daily allowance of 290 litres of domestic water, the average Palestinian 70.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Turkey&#8217;s South-Eastern Anatolia Project, intended to double the country&#8217;s irrigated farmland, involves the building of a series of dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers; one of them, the Ataturk dam, finished in 1990, ranks among the biggest in the world. Iraq and Syria downstream are dismayed. Similarly, Uzbekistan views with alarm Tajikistan&#8217;s plan to go ahead with an old Soviet project to build a huge barrage across the River Vakhsh. This, the Rogun dam, will be the highest in the world, at least for a while, and was expected in 2008 to cost about $2.2 billion, or 43% of the country&#8217;s national income. The dam will, it is hoped, generate enough power for all Tajikistan&#8217;s needs and have plenty over to export as far afield as Afghanistan and Pakistan. But since it may take 18 years to fill the dam (compared with 18 days, in principle, for China&#8217;s Three Gorges), there may be no water left over, or at any rate not enough for Uzbekistan&#8217;s cotton-growers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>International river basins extend across the borders of 145 countries, and some rivers flow through several countries. The Congo, Niger, Nile, Rhine and Zambezi are each shared among 9-11 countries, the Danube among 19. Adding to the complications is the fact that some countries, especially in Africa, rely on several rivers; 22, for instance, rise in Guinea. And about 280 aquifers also cross borders. Yet a multiplicity of countries, though it makes river management complicated, does not necessarily add to the intractability of a dispute.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One arrangement now under strain is the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan. This agreement was the basis for the division of rivers after India&#8217;s partition in 1947. Having withstood Indo-Pakistani wars in 1965, 1971 and 1999, it is usually cited as a notable example of durability in adversity, but it is now threatened by three developments.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> First, India proposes to build a water-diversion scheme in Indian Kashmir that would take water from the Kishanganga river to the Jhelum river before it could reach Pakistani Kashmir. Second, India, which already has more than 20 hydro projects on the three western rivers allocated to Pakistan in its part of Kashmir, is now building at least another ten and has more planned. Each of these conforms to the letter of the treaty, since it does not involve storage but merely run-of-the-river dams, in which water is returned downstream after it has been used to generate power. However, Pakistan is worried about the cumulative effects. When, in 2005, it complained about another Indian hydro project, the dispute went to arbitration. That resulted in a ruling broadly favourable to India which left Pakistan unhappy. It feels that the spirit of the agreement has been breached and the treaty needs revision, partly because advances in technology make it possible to build dams that were not foreseen when the deal was signed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Third, Pakistan badly needs more reservoirs. Storage is essential to provide supplies in winter (two-fifths of the Indus&#8217;s flow comes from the summer melting of glaciers) but Pakistan&#8217;s two big dams are silting up. It would like to build a new one in Pakistani Kashmir, but India has objected, and the money is not forthcoming. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another example, the Nile, looks more worrying but is perhaps more hopeful. The Blue Nile rises in Lake Tana in the Ethiopian highlands, the White Nile in Lake Victoria in Uganda (into which flow rivers from Rwanda and Tanzania). The two Niles meet in Sudan and flow through Egypt, which gets almost no water from anywhere else. For years most of the territories that now form the riparian countries were under the direct or indirect control of Britain, which was fixated on Egypt. Britain stopped any development upstream that would reduce the flow of water to Egypt and, in 1929, allotted 96% of the water flowing north from Sudan to the Egyptians and only 4% to the Sudanese.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thirty years later Gamal Abdel Nasser had to make a new treaty with Sudan in order to build the Aswan high dam. It would have made more sense to build a dam in the Ethiopian mountains: not only would the flow have then been easier to control but it would also have been cheaper and environmentally less damaging&#8212;and with less evaporation. But demagogues like their own dams. The waters were split 75% to Egypt and 25% to Sudan.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The other riparian states have been unhappy ever since, Kenya and Ethiopia particularly so, and all efforts to draw up a new treaty, fairer to all, have failed. They have not, however, failed to achieve anything. On the contrary, for the past 11 years the ten riparians have been amicably meeting in an organisation called the Nile Basin Initiative, and since 2001 have had a secretariat that deals with technical matters and holds ministerial gatherings. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In this group, irrigation and other projects are agreed on, many with World Bank support. Ethiopia is building three dams, two of them large and one controversial, for environmental reasons; and Egypt will take some of the electricity generated, via Sudan. In this way will two old antagonists yoke themselves together with water, the very commodity that has so long driven them apart. No one would say that a new agreement among all the interested parties is imminent, but, after more than 100 trips to Egypt and Ethiopia to help promote harmony, Mr Grey, World Banker turned Oxford professor, is hopeful. He believes that, in time, Ethiopia could be an exporter of electricity to Europe.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A third neuralgic dispute concerns the Mekong, one of at least eight rivers that rise on the Tibetan plateau, fed partly by melting glaciers in Tibet. The Mekong then runs through China&#8217;s Yunnan province, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. Recently, though, it has been running thinly. Sandbanks have appeared, navigation has slowed, fishermen complain of derisory catches, and the 60m people whose livelihoods directly or indirectly depend on the river are worried. The worst drought in southern China for 50 years is partly, perhaps mainly, to blame, but the downstream users also blame the Chinese government, and in particular the three dams it has built and its blasting of rapids to ease navigation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China has plans for more dams. It is hyperactive in the world of water, not only at home but abroad&#8212;building dams in Africa and Pakistan, looking for land in Mozambique and the Philippines, diverting rivers for its own purposes. Neighbouring states, notably India, are uneasy. Yet the row over the drop in the Mekong seems under control. At a meeting of the Mekong River Commission last month&#8212;all the riparian states except China and Myanmar are members&#8212;China sent a vice-minister of foreign affairs, who was fairly forthcoming about hydrological data. This was something of a breakthrough, even if he did not offer compensation to fishermen. The neighbours&#8217; resentment has not disappeared, and China will not stop building dams. But a water war seems unlikely.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most hopeful development is the success of other river-basin organisations like the Nile and the Mekong groups. Such outfits now exist for various rivers, including the Danube, the Niger, the Okavango, the Red, the Sava and so on. In the Senegal river group, Mali, Senegal, Guinea and Mauritania have agreed to disagree about who is entitled to how much water, and instead concentrate on sharing out various projects, so that a dam may go to one but the electricity generated, or a part of it, to another. This has worked so well that the president of the group has established considerable authority, enough to enable him to broker unrelated agreements among squabbling tribesmen.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The co-operative approach has also been successful elsewhere. Thailand, for instance, has helped pay for a hydro scheme in Laos in return for power; South Africa has done the same with Lesotho, in return for drinking water in its industrial province of Gauteng; and, in the Syr Darya grouping, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan compensate Kyrgyzstan in return for supplies of excess power. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The way such organisations work, when they work, is to look for the benefits that can be gained from organising water better, and then to share them. An arrangement can usually, though not always, be found that benefits each state. It may be hard to achieve in a group that includes a dominant member, such as Egypt. And it will also be more difficult in groups that bring together officials appointed politically rather than competitively, on their technical qualifications. In the case of the Indus the two sides&#8217; representatives get along well. The reason the treaty is under strain is that it starts with the water and then tries to divide it equitably. The secret is to look for benefits and then try to share them. If that is done, water can bring competitors together. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>It won&#8217;t fill up without lots of changes on the ground&#8212;and much greater restraint by users</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CAN the world solve its water problems? There is no reason in logic, physics or hydrogeology why it should not be able to do so. Most of the obstacles are political, although some are cultural, and none is helped by water&#8217;s astonishing ability to repel or defy economic analysis. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many of the small solutions are known. Some involve physical remedies. Flood protection demands embankments, or dams, or protected flood plains, or houses that rise and fall with the waters. Short rainy seasons demand water storage, ideally in places where evaporation is low. Human health demands clean water, and perhaps mosquito nets, and soap. Flourishing ecosystems require pollution control. And so on. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of the remedies require changes in behaviour, and policies to bring them about. If people are to use water with more care, they must know how much they draw and what it costs. They must also know how to use it, and reuse it, productively. To make progress on this front requires education, not least of politicians. Then policies must be drawn up and implemented. All this requires money&#8212;for meters, pipes, sewers, satellites, irrigation, low-flow taps and umpteen other things.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some policies apparently unconnected to water must change too. Trade and investment must be unfettered if water-short countries are to be encouraged to import water-heavy goods and services, rather than relying on their own production. Using crops like sugarbeet to make biofuels in dry regions must be abandoned. Governments must overcome their love of secrecy and reveal all the information they have about river flows, water tables, weather forecasts, likely floods. They must also look to non-water policies to solve water problems. For example, building a road passable in all weather all year round to let farmers get their produce to market will enable them to move from subsistence to commercial agriculture.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For their part, smallholders in many places will have to reconcile themselves to selling their land to allow the creation of larger, more efficient farms. Some farmers must grow more high-value, not-too-thirsty crops like nuts or strawberries or blueberries. And consumers will have to accept genetically modified varieties. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Personal habits, too, will have to change. Meat-eaters may have to hold back on hamburgers and learn to love soya. Golfers may have to take up basketball. The horizontally mobile may have to stop washing their cars. And everyone will have to become accustomed to paying more for food. At present the only water costs usually passed on to consumers concern transport or treatment. The scarcity of water is seldom reflected in its price, or in that of the farm products that consume so much of it. That cannot go on for long. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>None of these changes will necessarily be easy to achieve. Most cost money, and politicians are often reluctant to find it. The market would help, if it were allowed to. But it will take decades to introduce a system of tradable water rights, let alone market pricing, in most poor countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Meanwhile, investment is badly needed almost everywhere. In the developed markets of the United States, where water rights are traded, prices have been rising fast. But since water in most places is usually priced so low, if at all, the revenue generated is seldom enough to maintain or replace even existing infrastructure. Even in America the bills will be dauntingly large. Analysts at Booz Allen Hamilton tried in 2007 to estimate how much investment would be needed in water infrastructure to modernise obsolescent systems and meet expanding demand between 2005 and 2030. Their figure for the United States and Canada was $6.5 trillion. For the world as a whole, they reckoned $22.6 trillion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Such calculations are made more difficult by the uncertainty surrounding climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2008 that more precipitation was likely in high latitudes and some wet tropical areas, less in dry regions in mid-latitudes and the dry tropics. Rain was likely to become more intense and variable in many places, and farmers in the arid and semi-arid tropics were likely to become more vulnerable. On balance, disadvantages were likely to outweigh benefits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Few people have dwelt on the worst possibility, even if it is highly unlikely to come about: that the extra water vapour held by a warmer atmosphere might set in train a runaway greenhouse effect in which temperatures rose ever faster and tipping-points for, say, the melting of ice sheets were reached. This possibility has received little consideration outside academia, perhaps because less improbable consequences of climate change provide enough to be gloomy about. The wise conclusion to be drawn may be that all planning should allow for greater uncertainty, and probably also greater variability, so every plan will need to have a greater degree of resilience built into it than in the past.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The art of the possible</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But, setting aside the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect, would the measures outlined above be enough to bring supply and demand for water harmoniously into balance by 2050, when the world&#8217;s population is presumed to stop growing? The McKinsey report published last year by the 2030 Water Resources Group believes that such an outcome is indeed possible, and at &#8220;reasonable cost&#8221;, if the right actions were taken. Adopting an economic approach, the report develops what it calls a water availability cost curve. This has the merit of distinguishing between the measures that could be adopted cheaply in a country like India and those that would be more expensive, some of them vastly more. Yet it hardly constitutes the discovery of an aqueous elixir.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The difficult problem that still awaits an answer is how to get higher yields from food crops without a commensurate rise in the loss of water through evapotranspiration. This is the crucial issue if water is to be used sustainably by farmers, the biggest consumers in the thirstiest activity in the most populous parts of the world. Plenty of gains can be made by adopting no-till farming, drip irrigation, genetically modified crops and so on, but they all come to an end after a while, leaving any gain in yields matched by gains in ET. No one has yet found a convincing way of producing dramatically more food with less water. Genetic modification can help by producing drought-resistant breeds, but not, it seems, by altering the fundamentals of transpiration. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Unless some breakthrough occurs in getting the salt out of sea water, the best hope of a happy marriage between supply and demand comes from much greater restraint among water-users. This is what the farmers of Andhra Pradesh and parts of China are already doing. It is also what they, and many others, will be forced into if they do not do it of their own accord&#8212;unless, that is, they leave the land altogether. For, one way or another, supply and demand will find an equilibrium. The greatest chance of it being a stable and fairly harmonious one is the spread of democratic self-management among informed farmers. That would not solve all water problems, but it would solve the biggest. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Facebook and Google face a backlash, from users and regulators alike, over the way they have handled sensitive data</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | FRANKFURT AND SAN FRANCISCO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>JENNIFER STODDART, Canada&#8217;s privacy commissioner, is furious with Facebook. In August 2009 the social-networking site struck a deal, agreeing to change its policies within a year to comply with the country&#8217;s privacy law. Now, says Ms Stoddart, the company appears to be reneging on an important part of that deal, which involved giving users a clear and easy-to-implement choice over whether to share private data with third parties. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to me that Facebook is going in the right direction on this issue,&#8221; she says, hinting that, without a change of course, the firm could soon become the subject of another formal investigation by her organisation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Facebook is not the only internet giant to provoke the ire of data watchdogs. Google endured withering criticism this week following news that it had recorded some personal communications sent over unsecured Wi-Fi data networks in homes and offices in some 30 countries. On May 17th Peter Schaar, Germany&#8217;s federal commissioner for data protection, called for an independent investigation into Google&#8217;s behaviour, claiming that it had &#8220;simply disobeyed normal rules in the development and usage of software.&#8221;</p>\r\n\

    \r\n\
    <p> The cases highlight rising tension between guardians of privacy and internet firms. And they reflect concern among web users about how private data are made public. Several prominent internet types such as Cory Doctorow, a science-fiction author, and Leo Laporte, a podcaster, have abandoned Facebook. Sites such as QuitFacebookDay.com are urging others to do so, nominating May 31st for a mass Facebook &#8220;suicide&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> This is unlikely to stop the meteoric rise of Facebook, which is poised to claim half a billion members and which draws even more visitors as a whole to its site (see chart). But nerves have been rattled at the company&#8217;s headquarters in Silicon Valley, where bosses are mulling over how to respond. Several senior folk are now hinting that Facebook will soon roll out simpler privacy controls to make it easier to keep more data hidden. MySpace, a rival, is already making its controls simpler in an effort to woo disaffected Facebookers to its service.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A revolt over Facebook&#8217;s handling of privacy has been brewing for some time. In December the social network changed the default settings on its privacy controls so that individuals&#8217; personal information would be shared with &#8220;everyone&#8221; rather than selected friends. Facebook argued this reflected a shift in society towards greater openness and noted that users could still adjust privacy settings back again. But incensed privacy activists lobbied for it to be reversed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The switch should not have come as a surprise. Early on, many social networks impose fairly tough privacy policies in order to attract and reassure users. But as more join, controls are gradually loosened to encourage more sharing. As people share more, Facebook can increase the traffic against which it sells advertising. And the more it learns about users&#8217; likes and dislikes, the better it can target ads that generate hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Protests grew louder still following a developers&#8217; conference last month at which Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook&#8217;s boss, announced yet another series of policy changes. One that caused irritation was an &#8220;instant personalisation&#8221; feature that lets certain third-party websites access Facebook data when people visit. Critics say that Facebook has made it tricky to disable this feature, which may explain why Ms Stoddart dislikes it so much.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> European officials are grumbling about Facebook too. This month a group of data-protection experts who advise the European Commission wrote to the social network, calling its decision to loosen the default settings &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;. And in the United States, the Electronic Privacy Information Centre, a non-profit group, has asked America&#8217;s Federal Trade Commission to see if Facebook&#8217;s approach to privacy violates consumer-protection laws.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Privacy watchdogs are also seeing if Google has broken any laws by capturing Wi-Fi data without permission. The search firm says that an experimental software project designed to gather data from unencrypted Wi-Fi networks was accidentally rolled out along with its Street View initiative, which uses cameras mounted on cars to film streets and buildings. As a result snippets of sensitive private data were collected and stored for years, without the Street View leaders&#8217; knowledge. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Street unwise</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Google apologised and stressed that the unauthorised sampling collected only enough data to fill a single computer hard disk. It added that the information had not been used in any products nor shared outside Google. And it said it would appoint an independent body to review the fiasco in addition to conducting an internal review of its privacy practices. &#8220;We screwed up,&#8221; admitted Sergey Brin, a Google cofounder, on May 19th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Yet Google&#8217;s reputation has been damaged. The episode shows that it needs to get a better grip on what its staff are up to. Initial denials that it had collected sensitive data, reversed when Germany&#8217;s privacy watchdog demanded a more detailed review, also look like a public-relations blunder. And doubts have been raised about the quality of some managers. A spokesman for the firm blamed &#8220;a failure of communication between teams and within teams&#8221;. That is a worrying admission, given the vast amounts of sensitive data in Google&#8217;s digital coffers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It had already suffered this year during the launch of Buzz, its own social-networking service. Users complained that the search giant had dipped into their Gmail accounts to find &#8220;followers&#8221; for them without clearly explaining what was happening&#8212;a practice that the firm quickly scrapped. Last month ten privacy commissioners from countries such as Britain, Canada and France urged the company not to sideline privacy in a rush to launch new technology.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> At Google&#8217;s European Zeitgeist conference this week, Eric Schmidt claimed that the firm has the most consumer-centric privacy policy of any online service. Google&#8217;s chief executive added that no harm had been done by the Wi-Fi debacle. Others may reach a similar conclusion. But tussles over privacy issues will persist. &#8220;Nobody has a clear view of where to draw the line on privacy matters online,&#8221; says Jonathan Zittrain, a professor at Harvard Law School. Privacy commissioners will be busy for a while yet.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>On top of a wave</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A surge in litigation, against BP and others, is cheering a few</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVERY oil spill has a silver lining&#8212;if you are a lawyer, that is. More than 70 related lawsuits were filed in the two weeks after oil started leaking into the Gulf of Mexico on April 20th, most of them class actions that claim damages on behalf of many similar victims. Trial lawyers are dreaming of one of the biggest paydays since they feasted on tobacco litigation. Even more certain are the bumper fees for law firms defending BP, Halliburton and other firms involved. The most notable winner is Kirkland &amp; Ellis, which will represent the British oil giant.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>No one doubts that the BP lawsuits will dwarf those that followed the <em>Exxon Valdez</em> spill in Alaska in 1989, not least because the Gulf spill will affect a far larger, more economically significant area. The earlier disaster ultimately cost Exxon Mobil about $4 billion in clean-up and legal payments, much less than had seemed likely at first because a Supreme Court decision in 2008 allowed punitive damages to be slashed from $2.5 billion to $507.5m. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That reduction should provide grounds for BP to hope that punitive damages will be relatively modest. However, actual damages could run into billions, even before fees. Less comforting is the $75m cap on liability for economic damages under the Oil Pollution Act (OPA) of 1990. Regardless of what happens to efforts in Congress to raise this cap to $10 billion, this legislation may not constrain tort lawsuits under state or common law, argues Alex Tabarrok, an economist at George Mason University. &#8220;The point of the OPA was not to limit tort law but to supplement it.&#8221; Legal damages could thus be in addition to other compensation that is paid voluntarily to victims by BP and others, an amount that has been estimated at anything from $3 billion to $8 billion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BP seems certain to be the target of a familiar pincer movement between lawsuits brought by state attorneys-general and similar suits by private litigators. This time the trial lawyers are moving faster than their government counterparts, and even before much of the expected harm that they seek damages for has occurred. This is the result of fierce competition to secure lead litigator status and so gain control of the trial and the lion&#8217;s share of the fees. A crucial contest is looming between BP and the trial lawyers over the extent to which various lawsuits will be consolidated, and where the trial will happen. The trial lawyers fancy Louisiana, with its long history of generosity to class-action litigants; BP would prefer oil-friendly Texas. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Litigation over the oil spill is helping to reverse a downward trend in class-action suits against business. The BP case may be just the sort of disaster that tort law exists to address. But the justification is less clear for some other high-profile litigation. Jim Copland of the Manhattan Institute, a think-tank that produces an occasional report on the litigation industry, is sceptical of the validity of a current class-action suit that brings together disparate cases alleging that Wal-Mart discriminates against women. He adds that class actions against Toyota are a repeat of similar cases, with a mixed record of success, against other carmakers going back to the 1980s. They follow a familiar pattern: a firm admits to a problem and lawyers then use this as the basis for broader allegations about, for example, self-accelerating cars.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In 2003 tort costs were equivalent to 2.2% of American GDP, compared with 1.7% in Italy, 1.1% in Germany and less than 1% in Japan, France and Britain. That marked a peak: the share of American GDP represented by such litigation costs fell in each of the following five years, thanks in part to restrictions in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005. However, says Mr Copland, the combined effect of the recession lowering GDP and the rash of new lawsuits, ranging from those against investment banks involved in the financial meltdown to the oil-spill cases, means that when the data are collated for this year and 2009 &#8220;the downward trend will almost certainly have been reversed.&#8221; That is great news for lawyers. And who could begrudge them their good fortune?</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The medicine starts to work</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Profits are back at General Motors, but it is too soon to declare a return to health</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IF THE habit of the old pre-bankruptcy General Motors was reliably to overpromise and underdeliver, &#8220;new&#8221; GM is determined to do the opposite. Hence the relative lack of fanfare this week when the Detroit carmaker announced a return to profitability for the first time in three years, with first quarter earnings of $865m&#8212;something of a reversal from the $6 billion it lost in the same period last year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The reasons for the turnaround are easy to fathom. The painful measures taken before and during GM&#8217;s period in Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year, which included closing factories, terminating brands, cutting back its dealer network, reducing benefits for retired workers, establishing new labour contracts and slashing debt from $54 billion to $14 billion, have transformed the competitiveness of the firm&#8217;s previously mired North American business.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Critically, the sales break-even point in GM&#8217;s home market has been lowered from about 16m vehicles a year to nearer 10m. With demand slowly picking up to an annualised sales rate of 11m in America so far this year, GM&#8217;s North American operations turned a corner, producing an operating profit of $1.2 billion. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although some analysts are already looking forward to a steady stream of bumper profits, Chris Liddell, GM&#8217;s new chief financial officer recruited from Microsoft in December, struck a note of caution. The American and Canadian governments, which between them own 72% of the company, are eager for taxpayers to get their money back. But Mr Liddell said that before GM could consider a public offering three things must happen: vehicle sales must continue their recovery; recently spooked financial markets must steady; and GM must provide consistent proof that it knows both how to build good cars and sell them profitably.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Liddell is right: plenty of uncertainties surround GM&#8212;far more so than apply to Ford, which despite carrying a good deal more debt than its rival is doing a fine job of carrying out its strategy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> One of them is the merry-go-round of management changes instigated by Ed Whitacre, the 68-year-old Texan former telecoms boss chosen by the government to run GM. Appointments have been made and unmade with bewildering speed, which has contributed to an unwelcome appearance of instability. Mr Whitacre&#8217;s defenders say that he is simply intent on getting the best people into the 40 most important jobs and that overturning a culture of complacency takes time and experimentation. One of the few senior GM managers to have survived Mr Whitacre&#8217;s cull, Nick Reilly, the head of GM Europe, says that decision-making is now both much faster and more delegated. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another question is whether GM&#8217;s latest cars are good enough. On the whole, the evidence is positive. Dealers report strong demand for the new Chevrolet Equinox crossover and the Opel Insignia-based Buick LaCrosse. Nor has GM been forced into abandoning price discipline by the wall of money thrown at the market by embattled Toyota. However, as GM&#8217;s cash ebbed away in the desperate months before bankruptcy, spending on new models was frozen and the pipeline urgently needs to be filled with enticing new products.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Finally, even as GM&#8217;s North American business shows signs of life, not all is well elsewhere. Sales in China, which is becoming the firm&#8217;s most important market, are slowing from the heady, stimulus-driven level of last year. J.D. Power, an automotive-market forecaster, thinks that 2011 could be the start of five years of &#8220;sluggish&#8221; growth. With large amounts of new capacity becoming available, the pressure on pricing is likely to be brutal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Europe is even more of a worry. Losses there narrowed from $814m in the last three months of 2009 to $506m in the first quarter, but the market this year is likely to shrink by around 10%, and Opel&#8217;s German sales are suffering in the wake of GM&#8217;s decision to back out of selling its European unit to Magna, a car-parts firm with German connections. The German government is also still dragging its feet on whether to provide its share of &#8364;1.9 billion ($2.3 billion) of loans that GM has asked for to support Opel, while the new government in Britain may be having second thoughts about lending money to gm&#8217;s British offshoot, Vauxhall. Both could decide that GM can now manage on its own. No wonder that not even the bullish Mr Whitacre is declaring victory just yet. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Guilty of something</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Fourteen years in jail for China&#8217;s biggest retail tycoon</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | SHANGHAI | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A GUILTY verdict was never in doubt. When Huang Guangyu, the founder and controlling shareholder of Gome, a vast retail-electronics chain, vanished from public view in 2008 it was all but certain that he had been arrested. In due course he would surely be sentenced for various crimes. The only mystery was which ones.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The question was partially answered, after a closed trial, on May 18th. It was announced that Mr Huang had pleaded guilty to vague charges of illegal business dealings, insider trading and bribery. He was forced to pay 800m yuan ($119m) and handed a 14-year jail term, both records for white-collar crime in China. Intriguing details were revealed but these raised more questions than they settled.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Among his dealings Mr Huang acknowledged illegally converting about HK$800m ($103m), with some of the money going through a casino in Macau and an illegal bank. Officially, China&#8217;s capital account is closed, but its businesses are inevitably involved in currency conversion to carry out cross-border trade and investment. Macau has long been suspected as a backdoor channel for converting money. It is not entirely clear why Mr Huang decided to circumvent the rules, or why something believed to be commonplace elicited such a strong official response.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The size of Mr Huang&#8217;s empire undoubtedly attracted official scrutiny&#8212;and displeasure. From street sales in Beijing and no evident resources, he built a sprawling business. In 2008 Mr Huang was reckoned to be the country&#8217;s richest businessman, worth $6.3 billion, by the <em>Hurun Report</em>, a widely followed newsletter. At the core of his rise were the ubiquitous Gome stores, which sold cameras, washing machines, televisions and the like to a huge population just discovering the joys of consumption. But this side of the business was intertwined with property, imports and mountains of cash. Mr Huang was a man eager to pursue numerous opportunities.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Among his other roles he was a director and senior manager of Beijing Centergate Technologies. He confessed to earning 309m yuan through insider knowledge of a restructuring. On related charges Mr Huang&#8217;s wife was sentenced to over three years in prison and Centergate&#8217;s chairman to three years, and both were fined.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However murky the details of the first two convictions, it is a third which raises the largest questions, though it involves far less cash. Mr Huang admitted to paying bribes totalling 4.56m yuan to five government officials between 2006 and 2008. What he got in return has not been made public, but this may explain why the trial was held behind closed doors. Whether or not it is related to the case, there has been a profound political shake-up in southern China, including the abrupt replacement of Shenzhen&#8217;s mayor and a senior police official in Guangdong province. Mr Huang&#8217;s crimes will not be made completely public but the sentence in his case leaves no doubt about their importance. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A French supermarket chain takes a bet on India</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | DELHI | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ANAND GUPTA&#8217;S small and dimly lit-grocery shop in a middle-class Delhi neighbourhood does not allow customers much of a look at its crowded shelves. It stocks a range of dry goods, but little variety: a single brand of rice, one of flour and three of shampoo. Mr Gupta has no till and does his stocktaking in pencil. His grandfather, who opened the shop in the 1940s, would notice only one change: that the daily delivery is made by lorry instead of a fleet of bicycles and bullock carts. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is how most shopping operates in India, where &#8220;organised&#8221; outlets (supermarkets, hypermarkets and department stores) account for just 5% of the $450 billion retail market. The rest is done in tiny mom-and-pop, or <em>kirana</em>, shops. But that is beginning to change, as big retailers try to cash in on what AT Kearney, a consultancy, last year called the leading emerging retail market. Robust economic growth, a fast-expanding middle class and mushrooming malls all help organised retail to boom. The latest retail giant to arrive is Carrefour, which will open its first outlet in Delhi in July, with more shops scheduled for other cities this year. The French firm follows Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s biggest retailer, which last year opened its doors in Amritsar, in northern India.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Carrefour has waited nearly a decade, deterred by restrictive laws that let foreigners invest only in single-brand stores, in which they can own a 51% stake. Thus, far from serving the <em>kirana</em>-bound customers whom it wishes to reach, Carrefour will be limited to a cash-and-carry model, selling to hotels and restaurants. Yet it hopes that this will soon change and talks of the investment climate improving. Others concur. Raj Jain, Wal-Mart&#8217;s local chief, envisages opening a dozen more stores in the next couple of years. &#8220;There are much more positive noises in government than there were even a year ago,&#8221; says Rajiv Kumar, head of ICRIER, a local think-tank.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government has kept foreign retailers at arm&#8217;s length in an effort to protect millions of shopkeepers and their suppliers. Protests erupted across the country in 2007 when Reliance Industries, India&#8217;s biggest company, tried to set up a network of supermarkets. So the government asked ICRIER to gauge the impact of the organised sector. It found that the arrival of a formal retailer caused sales in nearby small shops to drop by 23% within one year. But five years on the small shops were broadly back where they had started.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In any case, big retail is moving in. Godrej, a consumer-products firm, is expanding its network of Nature&#8217;s Basket delicatessen-type stores across several big cities. Tata, with technical support from Britain&#8217;s Tesco, has opened Star Bazaar supermarkets. Bharti Enterprises has a similar deal with Wal-Mart for a chain of Easy Day grocery stores. Department stores and book chains are springing up, without obvious protest. As domestic retailers flourish, foreign ones are keen to get a toehold.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Small developments are making it slightly easier for them to do so. The price of renting commercial property has dropped by as much as 40% since 2007. Foreign firms are learning from domestic retailers with which they form joint ventures. Some reforms have helped: the tax system has been made slightly simpler, and retailers may now buy products direct from farmers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But not all obstacles are gone. Bad roads, unreliable power supplies and other infrastructure problems will take a long time to fix and require expensive solutions. Domestic retailers have been frustrated by the simple task of getting the right quantities of products to their shelves. The deep pockets of the multinationals may be needed before European-style hypermarkets truly arrive in India.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>With growth limited at home, Japan&#8217;s pharma industry is buying firms abroad</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS A country with an ageing and wealthy population, Japan ought to have a thriving drug market. In fact, the market is ailing. Hefty regulations and price controls mean that many new drugs appear elsewhere before they make it to Japan, if ever. The Japanese also spend rather less on their health care than most rich countries&#8212;around 8% of GDP&#8212;particularly profligate America. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To speed up growth, Japanese drug companies have been buying overseas ones. The latest takeover happened on May 17th, when Astellas, Japan&#8217;s second-largest drug firm, paid $4 billion in cash for OSI, the American maker of Tarceva, a lucrative cancer drug, and several promising treatments for diabetes as well as obesity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This deal comes in addition to the more than $20 billion that Japanese pharma firms have spent over the past two years on foreign acquisitions. Two years ago Takeda, the industry leader, paid $9 billion for Millennium, a big American biotech drug company. The same year, Daiichi Sankyo, the third-largest Japanese drug firm, paid $4.6 billion for Ranbaxy, an Indian maker of generic drugs (those whose patents have expired, thus making them less expensive).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Why the rush of acquisitions? Japanese firms are flush with cash and the yen is strong, making overseas assets relatively cheap. The deals also allow firms to move into new areas and build a presence in new markets&#8212;particularly in America, which accounts for half of global drug sales. A slew of drugs by Japanese makers will be losing their patent protections shortly. As a result, Takeda, Astellas and Daiichi Sankyo all expect a steep drop in operating profits this year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Astellas&#8217;s case, the OSI deal also shows a new sophistication by corporate Japan in handling hostile takeover bids, a rarity among Japanese firms (though the deal ended happily enough when OSI&#8217;s board accepted the offer). A year ago Astellas lost out when it was outbid in an attempt to get control of CV Therapeutics in America, after making a hostile offer. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The flurry of dealmaking coincides with a new pricing system, which went into force on April 1st and makes it more attractive to sell new drugs. Products are now exempt from biannual price cuts mandated by the government if they are deemed &#8220;innovative&#8221; (meaning that they do not have rivals or generic equivalents) and the companies fulfil other obligations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The new policy is meant to overcome what is known as &#8220;drug lag&#8221;. Foreign companies have been slow to bring new drugs into Japan, because doing so requires expensive and cumbersome trials often duplicating those already carried out in other countries. Moreover, the mandatory price reductions make for small profits. Last month most drugs on the market saw their prices slashed by 6.5% on average, according to Macquarie, an investment bank.</p>\r\n\

    <p>After so many overseas deals, Japanese drug companies are beginning to resemble foreign ones. Takeda and Astellas have both moved their global research and development hub to America. As the owner of Ranbaxy, Daiichi Sankyo now shares interests with other foreign makers of generic drugs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, the firms have not gone global: most of their revenues come from home. The big question is whether they will be able to integrate smoothly and manage their new parts. Astellas&#8217;s blockbuster drug is Prograf, which allows a body to accept transplants. Alas, no miracle pill exists to help Japanese executives magically manage a global workforce of vastly different cultures. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Portugal Telecom and Spain&#8217;s Telef\xF3nica squabble over Brazil</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;THE scale of Portugal Telecom is an asset for the country. We don&#8217;t want a small company, we want a big one.&#8221; So pronounced Portugal&#8217;s prime minister, Jos\xE9 S\xF3crates, this week, defending Portugal Telecom&#8217;s rejection of a hostile bid from Spain&#8217;s Telef\xF3nica for its share of Vivo, a fast-growing Brazilian mobile operator. Zeinal Bava, the boss of the Portuguese firm, added a warning that leaving Brazil would mean &#8220;amputating Portugal Telecom&#8217;s future&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet such surgery may prove hard to resist, given Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s financial clout. The Spanish firm offered &#8364;5.7 billion ($7.2 billion) in cash for the bit of Vivo that it does not own. That is equivalent to over 80% of the total market value of Portugal Telecom itself. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nine years ago, the two Iberian firms launched a united assault on Brazil, forming a joint venture from seven assorted mobile units that they already controlled. The resulting entity, Vivo, now has the largest share of a valuable and expanding market. With 52m subscribers, Vivo has a substantial mobile business and contributes 46% of Portugal Telecom&#8217;s revenues.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Although it is growing, the Brazilian market is also proving to be viciously competitive. Three main groups are battling for share in mobile and fixed lines: as well as the Spanish and Portuguese with Vivo (and Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s other assets), there are Oi, a local player, and Am\xE9rica M\xF3vil, part of the empire of Mexico&#8217;s Carlos Slim. Success will probably depend on consolidation and better integration of mobile and fixed-line units. Oi and Am\xE9rica M\xF3vil have already tried, but now Telef\xF3nica would like to merge Vivo with Telesp, its fixed-line operator. The resulting entity would cut costs and could offer customers bundled telecoms packages. Telef\xF3nica also needs to bolster Telesp, which is struggling as customers dump fixed lines for mobiles.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The partnership between Portugal Telecom and Telef\xF3nica soured in 2006-07 when the Spanish giant unexpectedly backed a Portuguese firm, Sonaecom, in a failed hostile bid for the national operator. Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s goal then, as now, was to push Portugal Telecom out of Vivo, which it had planned to buy from a victorious Sonaecom. Things have quickly turned nasty this time. Last week Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s finance director attacked Portugal Telecom for rejecting its bid without consulting shareholders, which he said raised questions about the firm&#8217;s corporate governance. The Portuguese say that Telef\xF3nica is cynically taking advantage of the euro-zone financial crisis, which has reduced Portugal Telecom&#8217;s market capitalisation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> If, as expected, Telef\xF3nica raises its bid for Vivo in the coming weeks, Portugal Telecom may be obliged to let its shareholders decide. Telef\xF3nica itself owns 10% of Portugal Telecom&#8217;s shares, but may not be allowed to vote on the matter. A hard core of mainly Portuguese allies hold about 30% of the shares and foreign investors the rest. Since Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s offer is so high relative to the value of Portugal Telecom, analysts reckon the Spaniards could even make an offer for the whole firm if its bid for Vivo goes nowhere. Another option for Telef\xF3nica could be to bid for TIM Brasil, a mobile firm owned by Telecom Italia, and add it to Vivo. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However bitterly the Portuguese resent the attempt to push them out of Brazil, resolving ownership of Vivo is just one episode in a far more important battle&#8212;that between Telef\xF3nica and Am\xE9rica M\xF3vil right across Latin America. Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s Movistar subsidiary is expected to win additional wireless spectrum and a stronger position in Mexico, Am\xE9rica M\xF3vil&#8217;s home market, later this year. Am\xE9rica M\xF3vil would not welcome a merger of Vivo and Telesp, which would strengthen Telef\xF3nica&#8217;s base in Brazil. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Could Mr Slim again be the one to ride to the rescue? He stepped in last time around when the Spaniards had seemed poised to seize full control of Vivo, in 2006-07, eventually acquiring a 5% stake in Portugal Telecom and helping to defeat the combined assault of Sonaecom and Telef\xF3nica. Mr Bava, who is now on a whirlwind tour of foreign shareholders, could yet conclude that he should be dropping in on Mexico City. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Many people who kept their jobs are working too hard. What can companies do about it?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN GEORGE ORWELL&#8217;S &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; the mighty cart-horse, Boxer, inspires the other animals with his heroic cry of &#8220;I will work harder&#8221;. He gets up at the crack of dawn to do a couple of hours&#8217; extra ploughing. He even refuses to take a day off when he splits his hoof. And his reward for all this effort? As soon as he collapses on the job he is carted off to the knacker&#8217;s yard to be turned into glue and bonemeal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; looks ever more like a parable about capitalism as well as socialism. Everybody knows about the scourge of unemployment. But unemployment is bringing another scourge in its wake&#8212;overwork. The Corporate Leadership Council, an American consultancy which surveys 1,100 companies every quarter, reports that the average &#8220;job footprint&#8221; (what a worker is expected to do) has increased by a third since the beginning of the recession. The Hay Group, a British consultancy which recently surveyed 1,000 people, says that two-thirds of workers report they are putting in unpaid overtime. The reward for all this effort is frozen pay and shrinking perks. The only difference between these overstretched workers and Boxer is that they can see the knacker&#8217;s van coming.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far workers have borne all this with remarkable stoicism&#8212;partly because they feel lucky to keep their jobs and partly because they want to save their firms from going under. But the Dunkirk spirit is beginning to fade. The Hay survey notes that 63% of workers say that their employers do not appreciate their extra effort. And 57% feel that employees are treated like dispensable commodities. Half report that their current level of work is unsustainable. People are wearying of frantic reorganisation as well as the added toil&#8212;floods of memos and meetings, endless reshuffles, the exhortations to do more with less. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For their part, companies are beginning to notice the downside of all this overstretching. Absenteeism is on the rise. Low-level corporate crime is growing. Corporate loyalty is on the wane. The Corporate Leadership Council reports that the proportion of workers who are willing to put in &#8220;discretionary effort&#8221; has dropped by almost half since 2007, while the share of respondents who claim that they are &#8220;disengaged&#8221; from their jobs has risen from a tenth to a fifth. But &#8220;discretionary effort&#8221; and &#8220;engagement&#8221; are vital sources of the innovation and creativity that companies claim to value so highly. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The biggest danger for companies is if workers head for the door as the economy picks up. The Hay Group reports that 59% of its sample are either considering leaving or actively looking for a new job&#8212;and more than 85% of those who are not in the job market are staying only because that market is so dismal. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most problematic of all is when star employees decide to look for work elsewhere. These &#8220;high-potentials&#8221; (HiPos) are doubly frustrated: they have been asked to shoulder a disproportionate share of the growing burden of work and they have seen senior jobs dry up as older managers try to cling to their positions. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A few signs suggest that overstretched companies are beginning to hire again. America added 290,000 new workers in the past quarter. But the growth in employment is likely to be much slower and patchier than it has been after previous recessions. Bosses report that they expect a prolonged period of slow growth in the rich world. And the recession that has battered the private sector will soon reach the long-protected public sector as governments desperately try to bring their deficits under control.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What can organisations do to cope with this new era of overwork? Most obviously they can redouble efforts to make staff feel valued. Cash-strapped companies are making more use of symbolic rewards. Cap Gemini, an IT consultancy, has a &#8220;gold awards programme&#8221; complete with a public ceremony every six months. This might sound suspiciously like the parades that the pig-dictator in &#8220;Animal Farm&#8221; organises to reconcile his fellow animals to their desperate lot. But, given people&#8217;s worries about their job security, it seems to work like a treat. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A second strategy is to make more use of that old favourite, &#8220;empowerment&#8221;. This means trying harder to explain why companies are acting as they are. At Dollar General, a retail chain, managers brief selected front-line workers on corporate strategy and then ask them to explain what is going on to their workmates. It also means giving workers some more control over their lives. Best Buy, a seller of electronics, measures staff by their results rather than their hours. Bombardier, an aircraft-maker, encourages managers from different divisions to act as consultants to each other. Cap Gemini gives as many people as possible 3G devices so that they can do their administration while travelling. More companies are allowing staff flexible working hours as a way of reconciling them to added burdens&#8212;if they can&#8217;t have more pay, workers can at least have more control over how and when they work. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Power to the HiPos</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A third strategy is to pay particular attention to high performers. A striking number of companies have introduced &#8220;HiPo schemes&#8221; to identify and nurture potential stars. Procter &amp; Gamble, which sells consumer goods, encourages rising stars to tackle difficult problems (&#8220;crucible roles&#8221;). Hewlett-Packard, an IT firm, lets its stars attend high-level strategy meetings and suggest solutions. The companies are combining these schemes with judicious pruning of less productive workers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This approach is less divisive than it sounds. Most workers are surprisingly keen on rewarding superstars (who hold the future of the organisation in their hands) and on dumping freeloaders. And sensible bosses are well aware that their competitors are already compiling hit lists of high-flyers who are dissatisfied with their lot. All animals are equal, remember. But some animals are more equal than others.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A new form of life has been created in a laboratory, and the era of synthetic biology is dawning</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN THE end there was no castle, no thunderstorm and definitely no hunchbacked cackling lab assistant. Nevertheless, Craig Venter, Hamilton Smith and their colleagues have done for real what Mary Shelley merely imagined. On May 20th, in the pages of <em>Science</em>, they announced that they had created a living creature. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Like Shelley&#8217;s protagonist, Dr Venter and Dr Smith needed some spare parts from dead bodies to make their creature work. Unlike Victor Frankenstein, though, they needed no extra spark of Promethean lightning to give the creature its living essence. Instead they made that essence, a piece of DNA that carries about 1,000 genes, from off-the-shelf laboratory chemicals. The result is the first creature since the beginning of creatures that has no ancestor. What it is, and how it lives, depends entirely on a design put together by scientists of the J. Craig Venter Institute and held on the institute&#8217;s computers in Rockville, Maryland, and San Diego, California. When the first of these artificial creatures showed that it could reproduce on its own, the age of artificial life began.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The announcement is momentous. It is not unexpected. Dr Venter&#8217;s ambition to create a living organism from close to scratch began 15 years ago, and it has been public knowledge for a decade. After so much time, there is a temptation for those in the field to say &#8220;show us something we didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; Synthetic DNA is, after all, routinely incorporated into living things by academics, by biotech companies, even by schoolchildren. Dr Venter&#8212;a consummate showman&#8212;and the self-effacing Dr Smith (uncharacteristically in the foreground in the picture of the two above) have merely done it on a grand scale.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Craig&#8217;s parts list</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But if it is a stunt, it is a well conceived one. It demonstrates more forcefully than anything else to date that life&#8217;s essence is information. Heretofore that information has been passed from one living thing to another. Now it does not have to be. Non-living matter can be brought to life with no need for lightning, a vital essence or a god. And this new power will allow the large-scale manipulation of living organisms. Hitherto, genetic modification has been the work of apprentices and journeymen. This new step is, in the true and original sense of the word, a masterpiece. It is the demonstration that the practitioner has mastered his art. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The journey to mastery has been a long one. Originally, not wishing to set himself a more difficult task than necessary, Dr Venter found the smallest living thing he could and set about making it smaller still. His chosen bug was <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, a creature that lives in genital tracts. With just 485 genes, it is the tiniest known free-living bacterium. He then knocked out the bacterium&#8217;s genes one by one to see which it could live without, in the hope of making a yet smaller organism he could then use as a model for synthesis.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This was something of a dead-end. Though there turned out to be 100 genes <em>M. genitalium</em> can do without, at least in the cushy conditions of a laboratory, it could not do without all of them at once. And finding which smaller genomes worked best took a lot of time, because <em>M. genitalium</em> grows rather slowly. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On top of that, the reason for wanting a very small genome started to fade away. DNA synthesis techniques were getting better and better, a fact reflected in their ever decreasing price (see chart). So Dr Venter changed tack, and decided to go with a lightly modified version of the entire <em>M. genitalium</em> genome<em>.</em></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Around the same time, in 2003, he synthesised the genome of a virus, Phi-X174, which has a mere 11 genes. It was not the first artificial virus; a team at the State University of New York, in Stony Brook, had made a copy of the polio virus the previous year. But theirs was a feeble thing, only just capable of reproducing. Dr Venter&#8217;s was the real McCoy: when he put the viral DNA into host cells they started to spit out new viruses just as self-destructively as cells infected with the natural Phi-X174.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The idea behind the efforts to make an artificial bacterium was, in essence, to treat a large synthetic genome as a giant version of Phi-X174 and use it to hijack a cell which had had all its DNA removed. The difference was that this time the result would not be a cell that produced more viruses, but a cell that produced more cells. By the time the hijacked cell had undergone a few divisions, all trace of its previous self would have been erased; its several-times-great-granddaughters would have transformed themselves into the new species. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Synthesising the genome proved reasonably easy. It was divided in &#8220;cassettes&#8221; about 1,000 base pairs long (a base pair being one of the genetic &#8220;letters&#8221; of which DNA is composed). These were put together by normal chemistry. The team then enlisted the help of yeast cells to link the cassettes in the correct order to produce the finished genomes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At this point it was necessary to prepare the cadavers, which proved rather trickier. It wasn&#8217;t just a matter of taking a bacterium closely related to <em>M. genitalium</em> and scooping out its DNA. Bacteria have defences against viruses in the form of chemicals called restriction enzymes, which chop up foreign DNA. These enzymes (discovered in the 1970s by Dr Smith, in work that won him a Nobel prize) would lurk in the DNA-free cadaver and cut up the synthetic genome before it was able to do its stuff. So the last step on the winding road was the creation of a bacterial strain without any restriction-enzyme genes, and thus without restriction enzymes, so that the team could have a purified reaction vessel in which the new genome could do its thing.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Or almost the last step. <em>M. genitalium</em> still had a slow-growth problem, so the team swapped bugs, lighting on its cousin, <em>Mycoplasma mycoides</em>. This has twice as much DNA, but that no longer mattered. To make the new bacterium recognisably different Dr Venter and his colleagues deleted 14 genes they thought unnecessary from <em>M. mycoides</em>, and added some DNA designed from scratch in a process Dr Venter refers to as &#8220;watermarking&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This was an opportunity for some fun. The watermark, Dr Venter says, includes a cipher which contains the URL of a website and three quotations, if you can work out how to decode it. The plaintext part of the watermark brands the bug as Dr Venter&#8217;s own, encoding its serial number as JCVI-syn1.0. (A plan to refer to the result as <em>Mycoplasma laboratorium</em> and have it recognised as a completely new species seems to have been abandoned for the moment.)</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The watermarking is not just a fancy signature. It means that if, despite precautions, the Frankenbug does get out, its entirely harmless presence would be detectible in any given sample by straightforward DNA amplification technology of the sort used in genetic fingerprinting. It might also trap thieves. Dr Venter has offered his invention for patenting&#8212;an action that is sure to be controversial&#8212;and the watermark will thus stake out what he hopes will become the property of his firm, Synthetic Genomics.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Once the finished genome was inserted into the genome-free bacteria, the work regressed to the sort of microbiology that would have been familiar to the science&#8217;s 19th-century pioneers. The fluid with the bacteria in it was dotted on to agar plates. Spots showed up on the agar as individual bacteria grew and multiplied. As a check, the researchers sequenced the DNA from some of the flourishing spots (a <em>Mycoplasma</em> genome is the sort of thing a modern sequencing set-up can knock off before its morning coffee). The colonies did, indeed, have the synthetic genomes. The masterpiece was alive. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Radicalism and ribosomes</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other journeymen, though, are hot on Dr Venter&#8217;s heels. And some have different ideas on how to go about the problem of making life, concentrating on things which Dr Venter&#8217;s hack-a-cadaver approach allows him to gloss over. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A minimal genome is one thing. At Harvard Medical School, Jack Szostak is working on a minimal cell, the components of which might be quite unlike those of any modern life form. Dr Szostak is interested in the origin of life, and wants to develop something analogous to what he imagines life&#8217;s earliest days were like: a reaction vessel in which a self-sustaining cycle of chemical reactions can reproduce itself. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In a modern cell, such as a bacterium, instructions from the DNA are transcribed into a related molecule called RNA. The RNA messenger molecules relay them to structures known as ribosomes that read them and make proteins accordingly. The whole process also involves a lot of proteins called enzymes to act as catalysts to the reactions. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many biologists&#8212;and Dr Szostak is one of them&#8212;think that life had a simpler early stage in which the varied tasks now carried out by DNA, RNA and proteins were all achieved by RNA alone. Even today, RNA molecules are not only messengers; they are also fetchers and carriers of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. And they can catalyse reactions, as proteins do, too. In principle, then, RNA could act as both a cell&#8217;s genetic material and its self-assembly mechanism. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If this idea is true, it should be possible to make a cell using just a membrane to hold things in place, some RNA, ingredients for more RNA, and an energy source. This comes in the form of an energy-rich molecule, ATP, which is what modern cells use to move energy from where it is generated to where it is used. Dr Szostak has already made a range of &#8220;ribozymes&#8221;, as catalytic pieces of RNA are known in the trade, and some of them are ATP-powered. He does not, yet, have a system that is capable of replicating itself. But that is his goal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Szostak&#8217;s cell, if it does come to pass, will be quite different from the protein- and DNA-based life familiar to biologists. It would in some ways be a greater achievement than Dr Venter&#8217;s, in that it would create something truly from scratch; but it would be of less practical importance, since that something would be very primitive compared even with a bacterium.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>George Church, a colleague of Dr Szostak&#8217;s at Harvard, dreams instead of making something intensely practical that Dr Venter has left out: a ribosome. The Venter shortcut&#8212;booting up a bacterial cadaver&#8212;means that the new-minted bug has to rely on ribosomes from its dead host to make the proteins its genome describes. It has the genes with which to make its own ribosomes, though, and as time goes by it will do so, diluting out the legacy that got it started. Dr Venter calculates that once JCVI-syn1.0 has undergone 30 divisions, all trace of the original cell will have disappeared. But that does not address the point that the new cells have relied on the output of genes from the old one to get going in the first place. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Church is working on making ribosomes&#8212;complex contraptions with dozens of protein and RNA components&#8212;from scratch. He has managed to synthesise all the RNA components in such a way that, when they are mixed with natural ribosome proteins, they form working ribosomes. Making the proteins from scratch is more difficult, because their shape is crucial to their function, so it is not clear whether he will bother to do so. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although he is interested in chalking up firsts, Dr Church focuses mainly on making tools. Artificial ribosomes, he thinks, could be specially crafted to add new capabilities to biotechnology&#8212;higher-than-natural protein productivity, for example. And that, for all the brouhaha which rightly accompanies the passage from journeyman to master, is the ultimate point: practical control over what life can be made to do. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another avowedly practical approach is that taken by Drew Endy, a researcher at Stanford University. Dr Endy wants to make the way that cells process genetic information more like the way that familiar computers do. Just as computers are built from electronic components that (at least in the days before integrated circuits and silicon chips) could be ordered from a catalogue by engineers and enthusiasts alike, so Dr Endy is trying to build up a catalogue of components he calls biobricks that, when linked together, will form useful biological &#8220;circuits&#8221;. Synthetic biologists will be able to order stretches of DNA that encode biobricks and link them together to do their bidding.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Endy&#8217;s approach is intriguing. His plan to &#8220;reimplement&#8221; life shows an engineer&#8217;s desire to replace biology&#8217;s unruly heritage&#8212;kludge built on kludge for billions of years&#8212;with something designed to be fit for a physicist&#8217;s practical purpose. Whether it will work remains to be seen. But a less thoroughgoing approach to modular design underlies the next stage of Dr Venter&#8217;s plans, too.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The constant gardener</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Biotechnology can sometimes resemble that rather older interaction with nature, gardening. It relies quite heavily on pruning and grafting. Gene-by-gene biotechnology constantly comes up against the problem that living organisms like to plough their own furrow, regardless of what their human &#8220;masters&#8221; might desire. The pruning part of biotechnology involves eliminating proclivities that might be useful to a wild organism, but drain its energy and metabolic effort away from the task at hand. The grafting part is adding new characteristics from elsewhere to the well-trained root stock. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Venter wants to get back to his original idea of creating a minimal genome in a peculiarly complete and rational act of pruning in order to be able to do a much more thorough job than has been previously possible of grafting in new stock. It is this ambition that makes his work something more than just a breathtaking novelty, positioning it as a milestone on the road from the craft of biotechnology, which manipulates genes one at a time, to the industry of synthetic biology, which aims to make wholesale changes to living things. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In this, Dr Venter seems to be going with the grain of nature, as wise gardeners do. Over the past decade it has become clear that bacteria are already well disposed to the idea of interchangeable parts. Each member of a bacterial species, or group of species, has a subset of genes (numbering hundreds, or a few thousand) drawn from a pool containing many thousands. Comparing lots of different but related bacteria can thus reveal a &#8220;core competence&#8221; similar in concept to a minimal genome. In seeking to build useful bacteria (ones that can, say, produce particular drugs in quantity) Dr Venter&#8217;s thoroughgoing root-and-graft approach may be tidying up a strategy that has been used for 4 billion years, perhaps even returning it to its basics.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He does not plan to stick to bacteria, though. The other challenge, besides the minimal genome, is to repeat the trick with single-celled algae.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The step from single-celled bacteria to single-celled algae may sound like a short one. But algae are on the other side of the great dividing line of life, that between creatures with a simple, single genome which is just a big loop of DNA sitting in the cell and those with genomes that are for the most part sequestered in a nucleus set aside for them, and cut up into multiple chromosomes. This second group includes animals, plants, fungi and algae. With no disrespect towards bacteria, which are remarkably innovative and spectacularly durable, the creatures that have taken the nuclear route are much more interesting&#8212;not least because <em>Homo sapiens</em> is himself one of them.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Algae, though, are interesting for other reasons. Many people&#8212;including Dr Venter&#8212;want to use them to produce biofuels. They would turn carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or, better, from power-station exhaust) into petrol or diesel by photosynthesis. At the moment, the microbes which make biofuels almost all do so through fermentation. The photosynthesis is done by plants such as sugar cane and the sugar is transformed into fuel by engineered bugs of one sort or another. Using algae would cut out the middleman.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The life to come</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All of this activity, however, relies on one thing: that the price of synthesising DNA continues to fall. In a way analogous to Gordon Moore&#8217;s famous law about the improvement of computers, both the price of sequencing DNA and the price of making it have plummeted over the past decade. The former means that the world&#8217;s databases are filling up with genes from every part of the tree of life. The latter means those genes can be cut and pasted together with greater and greater ease.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If synthetic biology is to take off as a technology, that is not merely good, it is essential. There will be a lot of trial and error in the process of creating new, useful organisms. Evolution by artificial selection is likely to prove almost as wasteful as the kind by natural selection. But there are those that worry about the proliferation of gene synthesis. Noting the propensity of computer-hackers to turn out what have been dubbed, by analogy, software viruses, they worry that hackers of the future may turn to synthetic biology and turn out real viruses.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is a risk, no doubt. But almost all technologies can be used for ill as well as good. Approaches that can create pathogens to order can create vaccines, too&#8212;and it is not too rose-tinted to think that the will to do good, often harnessed to the desire to make money, will attract many more people than the dark side will. They could create new crops, new fuels, new ways of investigating diseases and new drugs to treat them. They might do other, wilder things as well.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A more recent piece of science fiction than Shelley&#8217;s, Michael Crichton&#8217;s &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221;, conceived of the resurrection of dinosaurs. No DNA survives that would allow that to be done directly. But the ability to make genomes, coupled to a far greater understanding of how they lead to the structures of complex organisms, could one day allow simulacra of such creatures to be made by synthetic biology.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In any case, though dinosaurs have left no usable DNA, other more recently departed creatures have been more generous. Imagine, say, allying synthetic biology with the genome of Neanderthal man that was described earlier this year. There is much excitement at the idea of comparing this with the DNA of modern humans, in the hope of finding the essential differences between the two. How much more exciting, instead, to create a Neanderthal and ask him.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And if that seems too morally fraught, may we interest you in a mammoth?</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>That sinking feeling</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The bail-out has slowed but not stopped investor flight from Europe&#8217;s periphery</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BERLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Europe&#8217;s finance ministers emerged in the early hours of May 10th to announce a &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) rescue of the embattled euro zone, some joked that they had thrown everything at the problem &#8220;including the kitchen sink&#8221;. It turns out there are a few more implements left to hurl. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Germany this week announced a ban on the naked short-selling of euro-area government bonds and shares of some financial firms, and on the buying of sovereign credit-default swaps by investors who have not also bought the underlying bonds. Angela Merkel, Germany&#8217;s chancellor, gave warning that the euro is at risk as she defended the ban. If Germany hoped to calm markets, it failed. Shares slipped, as did the euro (see chart). Euro-zone solidarity fractured, too: Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, said she regretted the decision.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The pipes of the world&#8217;s financial system are gumming up again. One concern is that American money-market funds, which Barclays Capital reckons have lent $300 billion-$500 billion to European banks, are cutting their exposure to Europe, making it hard for banks and companies to borrow. LIBOR, the interest rate that banks charge one another to borrow, has jumped to levels not seen since August. The pressure is growing on EU states to get a &#8364;500 billion stabilisation fund, the biggest chunk of the bail-out, up and running. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the interim the European Central Bank (ECB) has been doing its bit (see later story). An initial &#8364;16.5 billion in government-bond purchases is thought to have focused on three of the smallest and most distressed euro-zone markets: Portugal, Ireland and Greece. That led to a quick thaw in these markets, where a week earlier trade had almost ground to a halt. On May 18th Ireland auctioned &#8364;1.5 billion in bonds and saw fairly robust demand for its debt. Two days later Spain attracted decent interest in a sale of ten-year bonds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the improvement is far from uniform. Spain had earlier struggled to sell all of a planned &#8364;8 billion issue of shorter-term notes, eventually scaling the amount back to &#8364;6.5 billion. And improving prices in the secondary markets may be deceptive because in the case of Greece and Portugal, at least, the only real buyer seems to be the ECB. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A significant change in European bond markets is under way. Europe&#8217;s decade-long &#8220;convergence play&#8221;, in which investors bet that over time bond yields across the euro zone would come together, is unravelling. Investors who had assumed an almost equal risk of default among euro-zone countries are now relying on emerging-markets desks to help them understand the credit risks they are taking. &#8220;Our emerging-markets traders were scratching their heads at some euro-zone government spreads,&#8221; says Andrew Balls of PIMCO, a bond investor. &#8220;What you have happening is an emerging-market crisis but it is happening with a country [Greece] that is a member of the euro zone.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The laziest distinction that investors are now making between different markets is based on size. That is a particular worry for Portugal, which is less of a credit risk than Greece but is vulnerable because it is so small. Both countries&#8217; bonds either are not in, or make up only a tiny portion of, the major indices that investors use as benchmarks. Investors are stealing away rather than bothering to discriminate between the two. &#8220;If you own them and they rally you really won&#8217;t make a lot of money but if things go wrong your reputation takes a hit,&#8221; says Paul Brain of Newton Investment Management. &#8220;For the smaller markets it is easier to just sell when the news gets bad.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The exception is Ireland. Although small, it has attracted buying when the prices of government bonds have fallen. One reason may be a form of &#8220;home bias&#8221; because English-speaking investors in Britain may feel better able to assess its chances of cutting government deficits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Bigger bond markets are less easy to abandon. Italy got away two auctions of five- and 15-year bonds fairly easily on May 13th. Many large investors such as insurance funds do not match assets and liabilities simply by currency but also by country. Yet investors in the debt of larger countries are looking more closely at whether they are being sufficiently rewarded for risk. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a sense, this is welcome. The compression of bond yields over the past decade was another manifestation of the mispricing of risk as investors sought higher returns. &#8220;Many investors thought they were buying German bunds with a bit of free yield,&#8221; says one fund manager. &#8220;Now they realise they had bought a lot more of the lira and a lot less of the Deutschmark than they thought.&#8221; However, repricing is deeply destabilising. Most large holders of government debt are risk-averse. A fall in price is more likely to prompt a stampede than a calm appraisal of valuations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That leaves the ECB in a quandary. In buying bonds of distressed countries it is, in effect, opening the emergency exits of a crowded theatre. Its hope is that in doing so it will make everyone feel safer and thus less likely to bolt at the first wisp of smoke. Yet the risk it faces is that in making an exit easier, more people will leave. That already appears to be happening in Greece, which received &#8364;14.5 billion from the European Commission on May 18th (in addition to &#8364;5.5 billion that the IMF had already released). Among the first uses of the money was repayment of an &#8364;8.5 billion bond that came due a day later. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A second dilemma is how far the ECB should allow interest rates to increase on the government bonds of countries such as Spain. Holding down borrowing costs will help make its fiscal adjustment easier, which should attract private capital. Yet unless yields widen there is little incentive for investors to hold its debt. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Germany&#8217;s bans on naked short-selling seem only to have heightened skittishness about owning European assets, as investors fret that hedging will get harder and rules tougher. The problem facing the euro zone is not speculative shorting of its countries&#8217; bonds, but rather the reluctance of investors to buy them in the first place. Berating the markets that fund it is a very odd tack for any government to take. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A pointless tussle over regulating hedge funds and private equity</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BERLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A WEEK after the virtual closure of Europe&#8217;s government-bond markets and a dramatic bail-out for countries on the periphery of the euro, you might have thought the European Parliament&#8217;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee would have urgent things to discuss. It could have debated ways of restoring investors&#8217; trust in the region&#8217;s bond markets, perhaps, or tried to understand why European money markets are freezing up. The same might be said of a committee of European finance ministers, which also met this week.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Curiously, both committees thought their time would be well spent agreeing on tough new rules for an industry that has had remarkably little to do with the financial crisis. On May 17th and 18th the two committees agreed to proposals that are intended to govern &#8220;alternative investment funds&#8221;, a long-winded name for hedge funds and private-equity funds, two sectors that in the eyes of many exemplify the ugly face of free-market capitalism. Confusingly the drafts contradict each other in some important respects; both differ, too, from a draft law proposed by the European Commission, Europe&#8217;s executive branch. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even so the proposals were greeted triumphantly in Berlin, which has long campaigned against both hedge funds and the &#8220;locusts&#8221; of private equity, and with dismay in London, home to 80% of the industry in Europe. George Osborne, Britain&#8217;s new finance minister, did manage to lodge reservations which must now be taken into account as the various proposals are reconciled.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most contentious element concerns the access that funds based outside Europe will have to European markets. At issue are questions over whether foreign funds should have to apply to each EU country to do business, or whether, as the parliamentary draft proposes, they could get a European &#8220;passport&#8221; that would enable them to sell their wares throughout the EU. In theory a passport regime should please the industry, but it comes at a high price. Funds would not just have to satisfy the EU about the quality of their home regimes in areas such as money-laundering and tax, but their home supervisors would also have to ensure that funds comply with EU rules. The parliamentary draft appears to ban EU investors from placing money with any offshore funds that do not meet European rules.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other areas of concern include proposals to impose bank-like limits on the pay of fund managers&#8212;ostensibly to limit risk-taking even though the risks they take are anything but bank-like&#8212;as well as constraints on how much funds can borrow. Investors are also worried by measures to increase the liability that custodian banks have for the assets they look after. Pension funds and others fear they will be charged a higher premium by custodians as a result. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not all these proposals will survive the reconciliation process. What seems likely to emerge is a messy compromise that will not drive the industry out of business or out of Europe, but will do little to improve financial stability either. There are surely more pressing issues. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Judgment day</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A giant insurance deal goes to the wire</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> BY THE standards of the wider stockmarket it is odd that Prudential&#8217;s $35 billion bid for AIA, the Asian arm of American International Group (AIG), has become quite so controversial. Shareholders are due to vote on the deal on June 7th and it is expected to be a knife-edge affair. If at least 75% of them approve, the Pru will conduct a $21 billion rights issue that month, with the deal closing later this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>True, that is a lot of new shares to swallow. But far from being the next Royal Bank of Scotland-ABN AMRO, or even Time Warner-AOL, the deal looks reasonable in many respects. It is less about striking out in a new geography or product area, and more about uniting competitors in Hong Kong and Singapore, which comprise about half of the activities in Asia of both AIA and Prudential. &#8220;In-market&#8221; deals have a fair record, especially if, like Pru-AIA, they create businesses with big market shares.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Pru&#8217;s financing is not particularly leveraged, another common pitfall. A deal would mean about $500m more interest costs for a combined business with $4 billion of operating profit. Nor is it buying a lousy business that has been dressed up. Having been prepared for a flotation before the Pru swooped, AIA is something between a grubby stone and the jewel it was before AIG hit trouble. After stagnating in 2009, its profits are growing and its margins on new business are below those of the Pru in Asia, suggesting potential.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That does, of course, leave valuation. Earnings per share will be heavily diluted but this measure is even less meaningful than normal because the Pru is conducting a rights issue, which distorts the calculation. An alternative is to look at the return on capital from buying AIA, which the Pru reckons will be 9% in 2013 (assuming 15% annual growth in Asia). This is mediocre but not outrageously bad. Santander&#8217;s 2007 purchase of the Brazilian and Italian bits of ABN, lauded as a masterstroke, was projected to generate a 12.5% return in its third year. Vodafone&#8217;s (dud) purchase of a business in India in 2007 was originally cheered by shareholders despite a forecast return of below 5% in its third year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the wonkish measure of embedded value (the estimated present value of business already written) Prudential is paying 1.6 times, well above where mature European insurers trade but below where many Asian firms do, and below the 2-times multiple Axa, a French insurer, recently paid to buy out minority shareholders in its Asian business. Axa, like Prudential, expects its Asian business to grow at 15-20%. For those in need of another sanity check, Hang Seng Bank, Hong Kong&#8217;s second-biggest lender, with profits last year almost identical to the underlying earnings AIA made, but with less growth, has a market value of $26 billion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So why all the fuss? Some accuse the Pru&#8217;s management, particularly its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, of high-handedness. But by normal standards of dealmaking megalomania (think of Sir Fred Goodwin, once of RBS) Mr Thiam is a model of courtesy and lucidity. The real problem with the Pru&#8217;s top brass is that they are almost all fairly new to the firm and entirely new to Asia. That may explain why they seem reluctant to ram together the two businesses as fast as possible. It may also be why they have branded the deal as a play on an historical shift in economic power to Asia, rather than a nuts-and-bolts job. This has left the Pru&#8217;s executives looking like neophytes just when smart money is fretting about a slowdown in China.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Pru says it aims to get &#8220;at least&#8221; $1 billion of cash from AIA each year&#8212;below the amount that its profit forecasts imply will be available a couple of years from now. Limits on extracting surplus cash from Asia were also why Britain&#8217;s financial regulator asked the Pru to bulk up its capital levels at the last minute. The firm cannot hire grisly Cantonese-speaking merger veterans with life-insurance expertise in the next two weeks. But if it wants to win the vote it might help to show shareholders that the deal is less about destiny and more about creating a cash cow. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Back in business but not back to normal</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE credit crunch took such a toll on private-equity firms that some commentators were &#8220;writing our industry&#8217;s obituary&#8221;, said Henry Kravis, the boss of Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts (KKR), a big buy-out firm, last year. Financing was hard to scare up, and deals were smaller and rarer. Things look healthier now.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 7th HCA, a health-care operator owned by Bain Capital and KKR, filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with plans to sell $4 billion of shares. If it happens, it will be the largest IPO of a private-equity-backed company in history, according to Dealogic, a research group. Other private-equity-backed companies are posting strong numbers. Alliance Boots, a British pharmaceutical company backed by KKR, this week announced an annual profit of over \xA31 billion ($1.4 billion).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even the failures look encouraging to some. On May 17th buy-out negotiations collapsed between several large private-equity firms, including Blackstone and TPG, and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS), a technology provider for banks. FIS shareholders are thought to have demanded an even higher price than the $15 billion, including nearly $10 billion in debt, on offer. That would have been the largest transaction since Blackstone bought Hilton Hotels for nearly $26 billion in 2007, at the height of the buy-out boom. The size of the deal, and the amount of debt available for it, take my breath away, says Colin Blaydon of Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, who did not expect a return to investments of this size.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deal-making is likely to continue. Buy-out funds currently have around $492 billion in &#8220;dry powder&#8221;, or unallocated capital, that built up during the downturn. Investors are pressing buy-out firms to deploy that money, so they can start generating returns, and in the meantime are refraining from pledging more capital, making fund-raising for private-equity firms a struggle. Buy-out shops are now dashing to find worthwhile companies to spend their cash on. This may be why attractive companies, like FIS, think they can hold out for a higher price.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But it is too early to be optimistic about a rebound in private equity. So far this year there have been around $50 billion of private-equity deals, compared with only $16 billion during the same period last year. But that is still nowhere near the $307 billion-worth that took place during that same period in 2007. The number of IPOs, too, has increased, but the market is still unreliable, and some private-equity firms have had to delay listing plans for portfolio companies. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And private-equity firms will continue to be burdened by the debt-laden companies they took on in the boom. Terra Firma, a British outfit, has struggled to keep control of one of its main portfolio companies, EMI, a record label, which it bought in a highly leveraged deal in 2007. Earlier this month Terra Firma&#8217;s boss, Guy Hands, had to ask investors for \xA3105m to comply with loan covenants and prevent Citigroup, which financed the purchase, from seizing EMI. He will have to raise another \xA3255m by this time next year to keep control of EMI until 2015. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>High-profile artists, such as Queen (pictured) and Sir Paul McCartney, have decided to leave for other music labels. And Terra Firma itself is suing Citi for fraud for allegedly tricking the firm into buying EMI and taking on so much debt. Talk about leveraged buyer&#8217;s remorse. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Man to Goliath</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Man Group acquires GLG</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR Man Group, which started doing business in London in 1783 as a sugar broker, life just got a bit sweeter. On May 17th the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded hedge fund said it would buy another big hedge fund, GLG Partners, for $1.6 billion. Combined, they will oversee $63 billion in assets, making Man one of the largest hedge funds in the world. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deal brings two big-name hedge funds under one roof and restores Man&#8217;s assets under management to pre-crisis levels. It also at long last provides Man with a more diverse investment offering. Man&#8217;s flagship fund, AHL, is a &#8220;black box&#8221; fund that uses computer algorithms to make investment decisions. Having performed successfully for years, AHL suffered a disappointing end to 2009. In contrast GLG has over 40 funds and a more varied bag of tricks, including long-only, macro and emerging-market funds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The alliance will also help extend Man&#8217;s geographic reach. Man has made strides in selling its investment products in Asia and Australia, and GLG has a more developed investor base in Italy and Spain. Neither firm has significant exposure to American investors, but they hope to change that once they have combined. There are cost savings to be had, too: Man says it will save around $50m annually as a result of the deal.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not everyone is convinced that the tie-up is worth celebrating. Some speculate that Man may have paid too much for GLG, by valuing it at nearly 20 times 2009 earnings. Shares in Man fell sharply on the day of the announcement, before recovering some ground later in the week. But compared with what GLG would have cost to buy before the financial crisis, its price seems more reasonable. And the agreement commits GLG&#8217;s three big fish, Noam Gottesman, Pierre Lagrange and Emmanuel Roman, to stay for three years. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deal may be a sign of forthcoming consolidation in the hedge-fund industry. Given the rising cost of doing business, thanks to more thorough due diligence and compliance with an expected wave of tighter government regulation, scale will be more critical for hedge funds in future, says John Feng of Greenwich Associates, a research group. Mr Roman tends to agree. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be very big like us, or you&#8217;ll be very small,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In between is going to be tough.&#8221; </p>\r\n\

    <h1>After the fall</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The ECB&#8217;s dented reputation is in part a result of hubris about the euro</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS meant to be an example of European unity, but in response to the euro zone&#8217;s fiscal crisis the European Central Bank (ECB) is having a fight on several national fronts. Even as the bank&#8217;s dealers were pushing cash into the bond markets of selected euro-zone countries, its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was trying to reassure Germans that the ECB had not lost its inflation-fighting zeal or its independence. He told <em>Der Spiegel</em> that it was &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; to believe that the decision to buy bonds, in the early hours of May 10th, was in response to political pressures. In a separate interview, he insisted that the bank&#8217;s monetary policy was unchanged and that its actions would not spur inflation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To back up that claim, the central bank conducted a special auction of one-week deposits on May 18th to &#8220;sterilise&#8221;, or soak up, the &#8364;16.5 billion ($20.4 billion) of cash it had created by buying bonds. Banks offered almost ten times what was required, which meant the ECB had to pay an interest rate of just 0.28%. The exercise was largely cosmetic given how much liquidity the ECB supplies to banks. But appearances count. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if the ECB has sinned and has to do penance,&#8221; says Julian Callow at Barclays Capital. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How did it get into such a pickle? In part because flaws in the construction of the euro left Mr Trichet with little choice: there was no other institution in place to help individual countries in crisis. The mainstay of the mutual-support package announced on May 10th, a &#8364;440 billion &#8220;special-purpose vehicle&#8221; that will guarantee loans to governments, will eventually fill that gap. In the meantime, the ECB had to mount a holding operation. The alternative might have been financial collapse. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the ECB shares some of the blame. One failing was not to anticipate sooner that banks in countries with fragile public finances and large private debts could be cut off from foreign finance. Its policymakers were too attached to the idea that the euro protects against all ills. In the early months of the global financial crisis, the ECB&#8217;s governing council insisted that &#8220;the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances.&#8221; This was both a dig at America (with its big current-account deficit) and a statement of startling complacency. A divide between high-saving, asset-rich and productive countries in the north and an uncompetitive, debt-ridden south is the source of the euro zone&#8217;s present troubles. Yet as recently as March, Mr Trichet was boasting about the &#8220;special&#8221; virtue of the euro in securing cross-border financing for its members.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This sense of unique European merit is undimmed. Asked by <em>Der Spiegel</em> to respond to German fears about inflation, Mr Trichet said the ECB&#8217;s actions are &#8220;totally different&#8221; to the quantitative easing pursued by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, because its bond purchases are sterilised. Even so it is struggling to escape the charge that it is providing support for governments&#8217; fiscal policies.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is what many in Germany had long feared. Axel Weber, the head of Germany&#8217;s central bank, has been publicly critical of the ECB&#8217;s decision to buy bonds. He is known to be headstrong and a champion of monetarist orthodoxy. But ECB-watchers think Mr Weber had little choice but to voice his reservations, if only to quell discord within the Bundesbank. &#8220;In Germany the feeling is that two red lines have been crossed,&#8221; says Thomas Mayer at Deutsche Bank&#8212;that each country is responsible for its own public finances and that the ECB would never be an agent of fiscal policy. German anxieties might be pacified were Mr Weber to succeed Mr Trichet when he steps down next year. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Prometheus bound</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Financial reform will make the Fed more powerful and less independent</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE decision of the European Central Bank to start buying government bonds follows a path trodden by the Federal Reserve in 2008 and 2009. Both entered politically charged territory to save the financial system at great risk to their reputations. For the Fed, one consequence is that the big financial-reform bill making its way through the Senate&#8212;a vote was expected after <em>The Economist</em> went to press&#8212;will leave it more powerful but more beholden to Washington, DC.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Fed has fought for, and kept, its supervision of banks. It acquires important new powers to regulate big non-bank financial companies and even to break up firms deemed a threat to the financial system. Its only significant loss of turf is direct oversight of consumer protection. The Fed keeps its emergency-lending powers, though it needs the Treasury&#8217;s approval to use them (it has usually sought such approval anyway). It cannot lend to failing firms because that job now sits with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the bill&#8217;s new resolution authority. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The price of these powers, though, is to be drawn closer into politicians&#8217; embrace. Since its birth the Fed&#8217;s governance has reflected a mix of political and financial influences. Monetary policy is the joint responsibility of governors in Washington, DC, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and presidents of the reserve banks, some of whose directors are, or are appointed by, bankers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Critics have long seen the bankers&#8217; role in the running of the Fed as an affront to democracy. Under the reform bill the president will now nominate and the Senate will confirm the New York Fed president (the most important of the regional governors). Fed-supervised banks will lose any say in the governance of the reserve banks. Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, wants to go further, either stripping all reserve-bank presidents of their votes on monetary policy or making them more accountable. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such changes have some worried that the Fed will adopt a looser monetary stance. In the near term, these fears are overdone. The economic environment remains deflationary. Excluding food and energy, inflation fell to a 49-year low of 0.9% in April. Political pressure for more expansionary policy has also been surprisingly slight. Opponents of Ben Bernanke&#8217;s confirmation to a second term as Fed chairman in January were more likely to criticise lax policy before the crisis and the Fed&#8217;s interventions during it, not its failure to maintain full employment. Inside the Fed, the pressure is also for tighter policy. Some officials are pressing for a quick sale of its holdings of mortgage-backed securities, although minutes of its April meeting suggest that will not happen before the Fed begins raising short-term rates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The greater risk to Fed independence is not pressure from outside, but the temptation from inside to broaden its macroeconomic remit as the lines between regulatory and monetary policy blur. Financial stability has been formally added to the Fed&#8217;s duties, alongside full employment and price stability. More governors will be chosen for regulatory and legal expertise; one will be designated vice-chairman for supervision. If Barack Obama&#8217;s latest nominees are approved, only three of the seven governors will be economists; two will be lawyers. Decisions on which financial firms to regulate, which to support and which to liquidate will increasingly be made with an eye on the broader economy. Interest-rate decisions will more heavily consider the impact on the financial system. A hard job has got harder. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Reading China's palm</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A new leading indicator for China&#8217;s economy</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BEIJING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN THE back lanes of old Beijing, a fortune-teller inspects his customer&#8217;s palm under a magnifying glass, consults his I Ching tables, then scribbles the formulae of fate with a blunt pencil. His customers include many businessmen, he says, anxious to know more about their economic prospects. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China&#8217;s fortune-tellers now have fresh competition. On May 17th, after four years of research, the Conference Board, a research group, unveiled a new monthly index of leading indicators, which aims to foretell China&#8217;s immediate economic future. After sifting through the country&#8217;s notoriously patchy statistics, the Board compiled its index from six: the expectations of consumers; lending by banks; the supply of raw materials to industry, as measured by a central-bank survey of firms; the amount of floorspace developers have started to build; and the export orders received and supplies delivered to manufacturers, as measured by a survey of purchasing managers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Because China&#8217;s economic present is almost as murky as its future, the Board also released a monthly &#8220;coincident&#8221; index, which provides a gauge of current activity. This index, based on indicators from electricity generation to passenger traffic, is more timely than the official GDP figure. It is also more volatile, perhaps because China&#8217;s official data tend to smooth things out (unlike its fortune-tellers, who can be brutally frank).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Board has retrospectively calculated its new indices for every month back to 1986. The leading index would have successfully predicted the Chinese recession in 1988-89, as well as the sharp slowdown in 2008. As the Beijing fortune-teller says, &#8220;If I can tell you correctly about your past, I can tell you correctly about your future too.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So what are China&#8217;s prospects? According to official figures, China&#8217;s economy grew by 11.9% in the year to the first quarter, raising fears of overheating. The Board&#8217;s leading economic index increased a little in March, thanks to the 153m square metres of floorspace started that month. But China-watchers should not read too much into a single month, the Board cautions. In April the authorities clamped down on property speculation. And judged over a six-month period (see chart), Chinese growth is not getting much stronger. As for your correspondent, according to the fortune-teller he will do well financially. But unlike China, he will spend money too liberally to accumulate much wealth.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

- :byline: Pay-for-performance for school students is no silver bullet

    <h1>Satchel, uniform, bonus</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Pay-for-performance for school students is no silver bullet</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>POLITICIANS around the world love to promise better education systems. Proposals for reform come in many flavours. Some tout the benefits of more competition among schools; others aim to train more teachers and reduce class sizes. Still others plump for elaborate after-school programmes or for linking teachers&#8217; pay to how well pupils do. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A relatively recent addition to this menu is the idea of paying students directly for performance. Boosters argue that pupils may fail to invest enough time and effort into education because the gains&#8212;better jobs and higher incomes&#8212;are nebulous and distant. Cash payments, on the other hand, reward good performance immediately. Link payments to test results or graduation rates, the argument goes, and test scores should increase and drop-out rates decline. Two new papers* describe the effect of such schemes in Israel and America. Their results will disappoint those who hope for a silver bullet. But they also suggest that cash payments may have their uses in some situations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Joshua Angrist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Victor Lavy of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem studied high-school students in 40 Israeli schools where few pupils went on to get their school-leaving certificate (the <em>Bagrut</em>). In half the schools students were offered a chance to earn nearly $1,450 if they passed all the tests and got the certificate. The economists found that completion rates in &#8220;payment schools&#8221; increased by about a third&#8212;but only for girls and mainly for those who needed to do only a tiny bit more to graduate. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In America Roland Fryer of Harvard University carried out an ambitious set of experiments involving 38,000 students who went to state-run schools in New York, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, DC. Over four-fifths were from poor families; nearly 90% were black or Hispanic. These are the schools that reformers in America most urgently need to fix. Students in inner-city schools do particularly poorly in national tests. Less than 20% of their 8th-graders (13-14-year-olds) have better-than-basic reading skills for their age. The national average is 29%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In each city about half the participating schools were randomly selected to be ones where students received money; their progress was then compared with that of their peers in the other schools. Pupils in New York and Chicago were paid for test scores or grades. The children in Dallas and Washington, DC, were paid for specific tasks, like reading books or wearing uniforms.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The results of the experiments where scholastic performance was rewarded were uniformly disappointing. In New York fourth- and seventh-grade students in payment schools could earn up to $25 and $50 respectively, depending on their score on each of ten standard maths and reading tests. In Chicago ninth-grade students were rewarded on a sliding scale for good grades in five courses, including English, maths and science. Getting an &#8220;A&#8221; was worth $50; a &#8220;D&#8221; meant no money. In theory a student could earn up to $2,000 a year. Plenty of money was paid out, but Mr Fryer found absolutely no evidence that paying students led them to do better than their peers in the control schools. Neither girls nor boys gained, and it did not seem to matter how students had previously performed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What explains this disappointing result? Some argue that the external push provided by money erodes an inherent love of learning. But participating students also took tests that measured how much they enjoyed studying. There was no indication that the payments affected those sentiments. Nor was it the case that students were uninterested in the programme.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Fryer has a different explanation. Most would agree that school facilities, teachers&#8217; skills, and the effort both students and teachers put in all matter. But how precisely these inputs are converted into a test score is a mystery, and without knowing which lever to pull, it is difficult to design an effective incentive scheme. But leaving it up to participants to find the best way to earn goodies will not work either if, as Mr Fryer believes, pupils have very little idea how to go about improving their own scores.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Grade expectations</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When students in New York or Chicago were asked how they would earn the rewards on offer, they came up with all sorts of ideas about test-taking strategies, but not one mentioned reading the textbooks or doing practice questions. On the other hand, those whose performance improved in the Israeli experiment had clear ideas about how to go about making sure they graduated. They took more practice tests and were much more likely to attend free coaching sessions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If students do not know how to improve their own performance, the best strategy may be to pick a simple task, reward pupils for doing it, and hope that this translates into higher grades. This was the approach Mr Fryer took in Dallas, where second-grade students were simply given $2 for every book they read if they passed a computerised comprehension test on it. Predictably this spurred them to read more books and improved their vocabularies. But it also improved their school grades substantially, although this is not what they were paid for. A year after the payments had stopped, students in the schools that had offered money were still outperforming those in control schools, although the gap had narrowed. It may have helped that the Dallas students were younger. Middle-school students in Washington, DC, gained little from being paid for inputs like attendance. But the results from Dallas suggest that payments can help at least some students get more out of school. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>New and valuable lessons are being learnt from the massive operation to stop the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS not the invasion of Normandy, but by peacetime standards the flotilla stationed about 65km (40 miles) off the Louisiana coast is a mightily impressive one. Where once the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon drilling rig floated in solitary splendour, there are now two similar rigs, along with the <em>Discoverer Enterprise</em>, a drilling ship; the <em>Viking Poseidon</em>, which knows how to install things on the sea floor; four mother ships for remotely operated underwater vehicles; various barges and supply vessels; and the Q4000, a rig that specialises in repairing and closing wells. If the well that the Deepwater Horizon was in the process of closing off four weeks ago continues to spray oil into the sea for months to come, it won&#8217;t be for a lack of expensive, sophisticated and improbable-looking hardware a mile up above it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is that mile which is the problem. The oil industry has been fixing blowouts for more than a century. The challenge is doing it under 150 atmospheres of pressure with the tools and lights of a robot mini-submarine that gets its power and instructions by way of a cable. Under these conditions well-laid plans can come to naught, as they did when icy methane hydrates that form when natural gas gets mixed up with cold water at high pressure scuppered plans to funnel the leaking oil up to <em>Discoverer Enterprise</em>. The hydrates did not just clog the pipes, they also buoyed up the 125-tonne cofferdam that had been lowered over the leak, lifting it right off the sea bed.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 16th, though, oil did start to be collected, thanks to a subtler intervention. Oil is currently escaping from two leaks, one at each end of the well&#8217;s riser. The riser connected Deepwater Horizon to its blowout preventer, a stack of valves on the sea floor which marked the top of the well proper (see illustration). When the rig sank, the riser broke near the top while remaining attached to the blowout preventer at the bottom, bending itself like a pretzel in its subsequent collapse. Some oil is now flowing from where the riser and the blowout preventer meet; most is coming from the broken end of the riser, which has ended up about 300 metres away on the sea floor. It is from a tube slipped into that distal end that oil is now being pumped up to <em>Discoverer Enterprise</em> and its attendant barges.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The insertion device, about a fifth of the diameter of the riser itself, is not supposed to block the flow of oil completely. If it did, the pressure of the oil would blow it out of the riser like a cork in a hose. Instead it sucks at the oil flowing around it, but gauging how hard to suck is tricky. Without enough suction more oil than necessary would continue to leak out; too much and it will let in water which will make the formation of those pesky hydrates more likely. Other anti-hydrate measures include a small pipe feeding methanol, an antifreeze, into the maw of the riser, and hot water circulating through a sleeve to warm the pipe bringing the oil to the surface. According to Kent Wells, vice-president of BP, the oil company in overall charge of the project, the amount of oil coming up through the pipe had risen to 2,000 barrels a day by May 17th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What fraction of the whole that represents is unclear. The American government has estimated that about 5,000 barrels a day are pouring out of the well. Other analysts reckon the flow rate may be five or ten times higher, on the basis of video images from mini-submarines and the area and thickness of the slicks at the surface. A well might produce 50,000 barrels a day. BP is keeping mum, but it does say that the plume of leaking oil looks significantly different now that suction is being applied. That suggests 2,000 barrels a day is a noticeable fraction of the whole.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Full fathom five hundred</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The next step is to try to staunch the flow proper with drilling mud, a mixture of water and clay minerals. The well is gushing because of the pressure the oil is under in its reservoir 4,300 metres below the sea bed. If drilling mud can be forced into the well under even greater pressure&#8212;a technique called &#8220;top kill&#8221;&#8212;it will eventually reach a depth where the weight of the column of drilling mud exerts enough pressure to stop any oil flowing upwards. The tough bit is getting the requisite amount of drilling mud far enough down the well.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To do this, BP has been replumbing and rewiring the blowout preventer, paying particular attention to its choke pipe and the kill pipe. These provide access to the central bore of the well underneath most of the heavy valves which should have closed off the flow of oil, but for some reason did not. The two pipes, which originally went up to the Deepwater Horizon, have been reconnected with heavyweight hoses to a metal framework called a manifold that has been installed nearby. Above it the Q4000 rig and three attendant vessels have 50,000 barrels of peculiarly heavy drilling mud and pumps capable of providing 30,000 horsepower with which to muscle that mud into the well.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The blowout preventer&#8217;s control pod, which was also originally connected to the lost rig, has been taken up to the Q4000, where it has been tested and attached to new cables. The pod should soon be on its way back down for reattachment to the preventer. The Q4000 will then have control over the valves that connect the choke and kill lines to the well proper. One reason why all this is taking time is that there are now up to 14 remotely operated underwater vehicles working around the well. A &#8220;simultaneous operations&#8221; unit is needed to choreograph the complex dance of vessels, submersibles and rigs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Wells says that once the control pod has been reinstalled on the blowout preventer and the manifold is attached to the Q4000, the top kill could start. The control pod will open the valves that allow the drilling mud to be forced into the well. At that point the fluid-dynamics equivalent of a titanic arm-wrestling match will get under way, with the surface vessels&#8217; pumps trying to push the mud down the well while the rising oil tries to push it out.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If the oil wins, then the team will try a &#8220;junk shot&#8221;. The manifold has two containers full of various sorts of rubber and plastic that are particularly good at gumming things up (Mr Wells prefers to call this a &#8220;bridging agent&#8221;). Open and close a few valves on the manifold and the drilling mud from the surface can squirt one of these junk shots down the pipes and into the blowout preventer. The oil pressure will force it up into the heart of the stack of valves. There, by making it harder for anything to get out of the top, the junk will give the drilling mud a better chance in a second bout of arm wrestling. The second container of junk provides another shot.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If both barrels fail there is the possibility of putting a new blowout preventer on top of the old one. That would mean cutting the existing riser, but now that the siphon inserted into it is bringing oil up to the barges it means risking a serious setback. So it may be wiser to wait for the relief wells that are being drilled to get down to the point, 4,000 metres below the sea bed, where they will intersect the existing well. At that depth stopping the flow with a deadweight of drilling fluid should create few problems, once the exceedingly difficult challenge of hitting the well is met. So far, the first relief well is only about 1,000 metres or so below the sea bed, and the second has only just been started.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Underwater spraying</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not all the remotely operated vehicles at the site have been involved in replumbing kill lines, hooking up manifolds and supporting the relief wells. Some have been swanning around spraying chemical dispersants into the oily waters. If the top kills do not work this spraying may also help limit the damage done by the oil before the relief wells are finished.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dispersants consist of surfactants (which are like detergents) in a solvent. When applied to a slick of oil they are meant to break it up into tiny droplets which disperse widely and are broken down by bacteria. The use of dispersants reduces the chances of direct exposure to oil by birds, fish, sea animals and everything ashore, but it may increase the risks for things on the sea floor in some circumstances. This is why they cannot be used everywhere. They are also toxic, though a lot less so than oil itself. In the early days of the spill Corexit 9527, the manufacture of which requires a solvent that has been linked with health problems in workers spraying the stuff, was used because there was not enough of its less toxic version, Corexit 9500, to hand. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BP has been criticised for its exclusive use of these two chemicals, which have been around for decades. Inevitably companies have claimed to offer products that are more effective and less toxic. Although BP had at first said it was not considering any other dispersants, a source at the company says it is now evaluating four additional dispersants, already approved by America&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and assessing the reliability of supply as well as toxicity. By mid-week some 582,000 gallons of dispersant had been sprayed since the emergency began.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Spraying dispersants in new ways, rather than using new formulations, may make more of a difference. BP thinks spraying dispersants into the oil plume where it leaves the riser may be 20 times more effective than waiting until it reaches the surface. If so, the 45,000 gallons so far sprayed at depth may have done more good than all the spraying at the surface. Three trials of this technique have been made by the EPA, the first two being inconclusive due to logistical difficulties.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The EPA has been trying to find out whether oil treated with dispersants at depth behaves in the way one would expect if dispersed higher up. It also wanted to make sure there were no problems with oxygen levels. The bugs which eat oil use oxygen to do so, so slightly lower levels would be a good indicator that they are at work. There is a risk, though, that the bugs might eat up all the available oxygen&#8212;which would harm other things and then stop any further oil-eating. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 17th, after the third of the trials at the well, the EPA approved the deep-sea use of dispersants, and BP is now preparing a ship to provide the analysis and monitoring that continuous spraying will require. Research into dealing with spilled oil is limited, and breakthroughs are scarce. If spraying at source really is as good or better than surface spraying, and requires a great deal less dispersant, it will be a boon. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There will be plenty of lessons to learn from the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Once the leaks have been stopped, Mr Wells hopes to get the failed blowout preventer to the surface so that it is at last possible to see what really went wrong. It is not just the engineering response to future oil spills that will be affected, but also working practices, safety systems and regulation. The future safety of offshore drilling for both the roughnecks and the environment will be shaped by what happens a mile below.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Using dairy waste as an alternative source of power</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT MAY seem ridiculous, but in the hunt for sources of alternative energy researchers have come up with fuel cells which are powered by cheese&#8212;or at least whey, a by-product in cheese making. Whey is rich in lactose, a sugar which Georgia Antonopoulou, a biochemical engineer at the University of Patras, Greece, says can be consumed by cultures of bacteria contained within a fuel cell to generate an electric current. Microbial fuel cells, as such devices are known, are not a new idea but they are attracting more attention.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The organic content of whey can pose an environmental hazard and many governments now impose strict regulations requiring factories to pay for its treatment before disposal. Whey constitutes about 70% of the volume of the milk used to make cheese. So, just one small feta facility will need to dispose of as much as 4,000 tonnes of whey in a single year, says Dr Antonopoulou. Microbial fuel cells could help, and not just in the cheese-making industry. Breweries, pig farms, food-processing plants and even sewage works could gain from the technology. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Traditional fuel cells work by using a catalytic material to oxidise a fuel, such as hydrogen, and make an electric current flow between two electrodes. Microbial fuel cells function in much the same way except that the catalytic reactions are carried out by bacteria contained within the fuel-cell chamber. Under anaerobic conditions (where oxygen is absent) they metabolise the fuel by feeding off it and in doing so produce natural chemical reactions that produce a current. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In theory microbial fuel cells can run on almost any kind of organic matter, says Chris Melhuish, head of the Bristol Robotics Laboratory, England. &#8220;All you have to do is match the microbial culture with the type of stuff you want to use as fuel,&#8221; he says. Dr Melhuish has been trying to power robots on domestic waste-water, but it is tricky. Ideally you would want to use cheap raw-waste products, he says. But traditionally the fuel cells work best with a refined fuel in the form of solutions containing synthetic sugars, such as glucose. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, Dr Antonopoulou has now shown that, using a culture of bacteria obtained from her local waste-water plant, it is possible to get almost as much power from raw whey as from refined fuel, provided the whey is diluted. The trouble is the power output still only amounts to milliwatts, barely enough to trickle-charge a cellphone. And working with raw waste water also presents challenges. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Initially Dr Antonopoulou and her colleagues found that the coulombic efficiency of their cells&#8212;a measure of how many electrons produced actually flow into a circuit&#8212;was particularly low, at around just 2%. This turned out to be because a second set of microbes, within the whey itself, was absorbing them. So, by sterilising the whey first to kill these other bugs they have now boosted the coulombic efficiency to around 25%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The total power of the device should improve further with a new design that increases the surface area of the electrodes within the fuel cell. One of the biggest obstacles is a lack of investment to develop materials that would work better with microbial fuel cells. If the various hurdles can be overcome and the devices can be scaled up to industrial levels, then the technology can only mature; just like a good cheese.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Fighting off rivals may be responsible for masculine traits</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN two drunken men fight over a woman, alcohol and stupidity may not be the only things at work. Sadly, evolution may have shaped men to behave this way. Almost all of the traits considered to be masculine&#8212;big muscles, facial hair, square jaws, deep voices and a propensity to violence&#8212;evolved, it now seems, specifically for their usefulness in fighting off or intimidating other men, allowing the winner to get the girl.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That, at least, is the contention of David Puts, an anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University, in an upcoming paper in <em>Evolution and Human Behavior</em>. Dr Puts is looking at how sexual selection gave rise to certain human traits. A trait is sexually selected if it evolved specifically to enhance mating success. They come in two main forms: weapons, such as an elk&#8217;s horns are used to fight off competitors; and ornaments, like a peacock&#8217;s tail, which are used to advertise genetic fitness to attract the opposite sex.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Researchers have tended to consider human sexual selection through the lens of the female&#8217;s choice of her mate. But human males look a lot more like animals designed to battle with one another for access to females, says Dr Puts. On average, men have 40% more fat-free mass than women, which is similar to the difference in gorillas, a species in which males unquestionably compete with other males for exclusive sexual access to females. In species whose males do not fight for access to females, males are generally the same size as, or smaller than, females.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The heavier brow and jaw of males might have developed to withstand blows from other males. (In prehistoric times, a broken jaw could have ended up being a fatal injury.) Heavy eyebrows, facial hair and deep voices all could serve to make a man more imposing to other men. Dr Puts does not dismiss mate selection outright. Women are attracted to some of the same traits that are good for dominating other men because they signal that the man will sire sons who will also be successful at mating. But female choice probably is not the primary cause of the traits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is a disturbing idea to modern minds, harking back to old stereotypes about violent cavemen battling with clubs while a passive woman, fetching in furs, waits helplessly to see who will win her. But Dr Puts emphasises that evolutionary biology is not destiny. Regardless of our evolutionary past, in modern societies men and women freely choose their mates. However, understanding the evolutionary pressures that made men the way they are could help us better understand male violence, including murder, domestic abuse, gang violence and perhaps even warfare.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    \r\n\
    <p>HAD Charles Ephrussi, art-lover and banking scion, been asked to choose a memento of himself to future generations what might he have picked? Perhaps a stack of issues of the <em>Gazette des Beaux Arts</em>, of which he became the editor and proprietor, or the still-life of asparagus stalks that he bought from Edouard Manet at a price that prompted the painter to send him a canvas of an extra stalk in wry gratitude. Perhaps, had he lived to see it, he might have chosen a copy of the magnum opus by his prot\xE9g\xE9, Marcel Proust, whose protagonist, the aesthete Charles Swann, is modelled partly on Ephrussi himself.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At any rate, surely not his netsuke. The 264 miniature figurines that he bought as a job lot during the infatuation with <em>Japonisme</em> that swept 1870s Paris became increasingly out of place as Ephrussi&#8217;s taste, always catholic, drifted to Impressionist masterpieces and Empire furnishings. Originally fashioned as toggles for the pouches worn on Japanese robes, these were exquisite yet playful depictions of everyday creatures and scenes: entwined lovers, a sleeping monk, rats and snakes and birds and, pictured above, an ivory hare with inset eyes of amber; &#8220;born&#8221;, Rudyard Kipling wrote while travelling to Japan in 1889, &#8220;of every mood of mirth, scorn and experience that sways the heart of man.&#8221; In the end, Charles packed them up and sent them off as an enigmatic wedding present to his cousin Viktor in Vienna.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hailing from Odessa, the Ephrussis were bankers who had built their fortune on grain trading. In their heyday they were mentioned in the same&#8212;sometimes anti-Semitic&#8212;breath as the Rothschilds, whom they occasionally married. For Charles, hunting for Japanese trinkets (together with his mistress, the wife of another Jewish banker) was just one way of marking his and his family&#8217;s status as paid-up members of the French <em>haute bourgeoisie</em>. The Dreyfus affair notwithstanding, they became as secure as Jews in Europe ever would be before the Nazis came. As for Viktor&#8217;s branch of the family, under the benevolent Emperor Franz Josef they were, writes Edmund de Waal, Viktor&#8217;s great-grandson, &#8220;so perfectly assimilated they &#8230;disappeared into Vienna.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Among the other ponderous ornaments of that assimilation, the netsuke sat uneasily. Banished from Charles&#8217;s Belle Epoque mansion, they were relegated to the dressing room of Viktor&#8217;s wife, Emmy, in their even grander palace on Vienna&#8217;s Ringstrasse. There in the intimate heart of the house, shielded from visitors, they lay like a tiny reminder of the Ephrussis&#8217; own irreducible nub of outsiderness.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And yet it was the netsuke that found their way into Mr de Waal&#8217;s hands, to serve as the thread of this history of his ancestors. In any other hands they might have been too fragile for such a weight. Apart from the surprising twist of intrigue by which they, almost alone of the family treasures, survive the ransacking by the Nazis, the netsuke are bit players in the plot. Not one is ever lost, sold or even so much as coveted&#8212;unlike Emmy herself, whose cuckolding of her husband with an array of fine young men is still a topic of mirth among Vienna genealogists a century later.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But Mr de Waal, a noted British potter and ceramicist, is intently concerned with &#8220;how objects get handled, used and handed on&#8221;. For him the netsuke, so small and captivating, were not enough as a mere signpost to a family history. He wanted &#8220;to know what the relationship has been between this wooden object that I am rolling between my fingers&#8212;hard and tricky and Japanese&#8212;and where it has been&#8230; I want to walk into each room where this object has lived, to feel the volume of the space, to know what pictures were on the walls, how the light fell from the windows.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And, wonder of wonders, this is exactly what he achieves. We learn not only how the light fell from the windows, but how it reflected from the carpets and brocades that vied for attention with the netsuke nestled on green velvet in their black lacquer vitrine, and how it grew greyer when wartime privations in Vienna limited the cleaning of the glass. We learn about Viktor&#8217;s nervous tic of wiping his hand across his face as if rearranging it, and the way Emmy would spend 40 minutes having her curls pinned one by one to the brim of her hat for a day at the races, and at what times marching bands paraded past their windows and what epaulettes they wore, and how Charles carried his cane and arranged his paintings, and the mix of awe and sensuality that he must have felt as he picked up a netsuke and turned it over in his hands. From a hard and vast archival mass of journals, memoirs, newspaper clippings and art-history books, Mr de Waal has fashioned, stroke by minuscule stroke, a book as fresh with detail as if it had been written from life, and as full of beauty and whimsy as a netsuke from the hands of a master carver. Buy two copies of his book; keep one and give the other to your closest bookish friend.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Unspoken Alliance: Israel&#8217;s Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa. </strong>By Sasha Polakow-Suransky. <em>Pantheon; 352 pages; $27.95 </em>Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ISRAEL is keen to discredit Richard Goldstone as punishment for his United Nations report criticising Israel&#8217;s assault on Gaza last year. So its government made much hoopla of the &#8220;revelation&#8221;, earlier this month, that as a judge in apartheid South Africa Mr Goldstone sentenced 28 black men to hang and four to be flogged.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Israeli officials may feel their moral sense is keener than that of Nelson Mandela, who knew the judge&#8217;s record yet respected his subsequent anti-apartheid work enough to appoint him to the country&#8217;s highest court. They may yet explain how being tough on black people is proof of pro-Palestinian bias. But it would be hard for them to shrug off the fact that even when South Africa faced blanket international sanctions, one country continued to supply it copiously with arms and helped it to build a nuclear bomb: Israel.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At one level it was classic realpolitik. South Africa needed arms; Israel, after the debacle of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, needed uranium and foreign currency. So Israel sold South Africa weapons, sharing nuclear know-how and converting South African uranium yellowcake into plutonium for its bombs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That the collaboration became so deep and long-lasting testifies to how realpolitik can mutate into <em>Weltanschauung</em>, the word the Nazis used for a &#8220;world view&#8221;. Nazi sympathisers may have helped propel the architects of apartheid to power, but letters between Jewish Israeli and white South African leaders, quoted in &#8220;The Unspoken Alliance&#8221;, illustrate a shared conviction: here were two small nations surrounded by hostile hordes, fighting for their land and identity, standing as bulwarks against Soviet empire-building. Even after it too adopted its own sanctions against South Africa in 1987, Israel made sure not to touch existing arms contracts, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, which ran until shortly before apartheid ended in 1994.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Much of the story is known, but the author, relying on family connections to obtain interviews and gain access to newly declassified South African documents (the Israelis, whose current president, Shimon Peres, struck the first arms deals while denouncing apartheid in public, were not so forthcoming), illuminates the personal relationships and shows how the players overcame moral qualms and political encumbrances. He also fills in several gaps, such as the secret deal in which South Africa agreed to lift safeguards on some 450 tonnes of yellowcake it had sold to Israel for civilian use, in return for some Israeli-made tritium to boost its own nuclear bombs. When the impending bankruptcy of a South African minister threatened to derail the deal, Israel saw to it that he received a bail-out so he could keep his job.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is a deft, pacy and revealing account, and for the most part, admirably dispassionate. It strays into polemic only in the epilogue, where the author warns that Israel may face South Africa&#8217;s fate if it does not mend its behaviour towards the Palestinians. Judging by their fury at Mr Goldstone, Israeli officials know this all too well&#8212;but still think they can bluster their way out.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Finger: A Handbook. </strong>By Angus Trumble. <em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 300 pages; $28. To be published in Britain by Yale University Press in August; \xA318.99. </em>Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVER given someone the finger? Did you know that this most understandable of gestures has its origins in ancient Greece and Rome where the <em>digitus impudicus</em> appeared in the works of Aristophanes and Martial: &#8220;Laugh loudly, Sextillus, when someone calls you a queen and put your middle finger out.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In this intriguing but verbose book (a robust edit would have paid dividends), Angus Trumble, a curator at the Yale Centre for British Art, examines fingers from every angle and tells some appealing anecdotes along the way. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Fingers are integral to art, communication, touch, love, fashion and counting. Using complex gestures the Romans could count to 1m: the word &#8220;digit&#8221;&#8212;the numerals below ten&#8212;originates from <em>digitus</em>, the Latin for finger. The phraseology of fingers is rich: we can have a finger in every pie, pull our finger out, twist someone around our little finger, let things slip through our fingers and, if unlucky, get our fingers burned. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Drawing on his knowledge, Mr Trumble investigates fingers in art, from cave pictures through to Michelangelo&#8217;s &#8220;Creation of Man&#8221;, classical works by Anthony van Dyck and Peter Paul Rubens portraying the fashion for gloves, and Pablo Picasso&#8217;s &#8220;Guernica&#8221;, with its anatomically correct knuckles and nails.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One important use of fingers (and thumbs) is to communicate&#8212;through sign language, handwriting, Braille, typing, gesture and now txt mssgng. &#8220;Index&#8221;, from the Latin for &#8220;indicator&#8221;, comes from the Romans&#8217; realisation that babies use their first finger to point. Between the 12th and 18th centuries a fist with a pointing index finger, a manicule, was drawn in book margins to denote important passages. The manicule now exists on the internet; watch your cursor change to a hand with a pointing finger when you click on a link. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most entertaining chapter is on the whims of fashion. Nail varnish emerged in the 1920s. For some, painted nails represented a hint of the demimonde, but a classy thumbs up soon changed that. In 1929, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that while King George V was convalescing at Bognor, Queen Mary was seen buying nail polish in Woolworth&#8217;s.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>What is it good for?</h1>\r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>War. </strong>By Sebastian Junger. <em>Twelve; 301 pages; $26.99. Fourth Estate; \xA316.99. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT TAKES a very good book to carry off a title as portentous as &#8220;War&#8221;, and Sebastian Junger has written one. The story of a year-long tour of Afghanistan by an American army platoon, with whom Mr Junger was &#8220;embedded&#8221; for several spells, it is, among other things, an outstanding war report: a precise and gripping account of some of the fiercest battles involving American soldiers in recent times.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Junger&#8217;s study, a platoon of airborne infantry, was deployed to the Korengal valley, a remote and craggy tract of north-eastern Afghanistan. Of negligible strategic importance, the Korengal gained notoriety in 2005 after 19 American commandos were killed there, in one of the single biggest human and military disasters for the Americans in the then four-year campaign. An army company was subsequently deployed to the narrow, six-mile-long valley, to restore American pride, many assumed. Yet the mission failed&#8212;for many of the same reasons now threatening America and its allies&#8217; overall effort in Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The American military presence was detested by the local Korengalis, a fierce and radicalised tribe who speak a language of their own and have never been ruled from outside. It also drew waves of jihadist fighters from nearby Pakistan. In the carnage that ensued, 42 Americans were killed and hundreds wounded by an enemy, Mr Junger&#8217;s account suggests, that they respected yet hardly understood. Many civilians were also killed in crossfire and aerial bombing&#8212;to which American efforts to win Afghan &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; also fell victim. Shortly after he assumed command of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan last year, General Stanley McChrystal speculated that his soldiers in the Korengal were making more enemies every day than they were killing. Last month it was announced that the Americans had been withdrawn from the valley.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Junger, an American journalist known for his 1997 bestseller, &#8220;The Perfect Storm&#8221;, about the loss of a trawler and its six-man crew off the coast of Nova Scotia, offers little overt analysis of the wider war. Nor, revealingly, does he shed much light on America&#8217;s enemies in the Korengal. He sometimes suggests they were mostly foreign, at others that they were entirely local. Mr Junger is more interested in the war as it is experienced by the American soldiers, mostly white 20-somethings, with whom he eats, sleeps and very often nearly gets killed. This is not an objective account of the war; nor, Mr Junger insists, can war reporters ever provide one. He is in awe of his fellows&#8217; fighting skills and mostly good-tempered acceptance of, indeed sometimes relish for, appalling danger. This leads him to a broader inquiry into why this is generally true of modern soldiers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The main reason, Mr Junger observes and numerous studies have confirmed, is love. The Americans in the Korengal, heroes by the standards of any warrior culture, are not especially religious or patriotic. They show little interest in the war overall or allegiance to the army at large; indeed, they cheer other units&#8217; misfortunes. Rather, with passionate intensity, they fight for each other. &#8220;What the Army sociologists, with their clipboards and their questions and their endless meta-analyses slowly came to understand was that courage was love,&#8221; Mr Junger writes. &#8220;In war, neither could exist without the other.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;War&#8221; becomes a love story, which Mr Junger sees unfold among a bunch of filthy infantrymen on a shot-up Afghan crag. He suggests many explanations for their growing attachment: a shared experience of suffering; an absence of other close relationships; an instinctive appreciation that the best hope for self-preservation lies with the group. In fact, as Mr Junger shows with several examples of suicidal bravery, this impulse can be fatal. Pondering the irony of that, he argues that the fame societies reserve for fallen heroes provides small compensation for their premature deaths, ensuring their names live on after their genes have been extinguished. This book provides that service for Juan Restrepo, Larry Rougle, Jason Bogar and the other Americans killed in the Korengal. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One thing Mr Junger does not do, however, is push his main point to its logical conclusion: if soldiers fight bravely for love, then so may the Taliban.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Selflessness of strangers</h1>\r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>The Price of Altruism: George Price and the Search for the Origins of Kindness. </strong>By Oren Harman. <em>W.W. Norton; 464 pages; $27.95. The Bodley Head; \xA320. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN George Price died in January 1975, his funeral in London was attended by five homeless men: dishevelled, smelly and cold. Alongside them were Bill Hamilton and John Maynard Smith, both distinguished British evolutionary biologists. All seven men had come to mourn an American scientist who helped to unpick the riddle of why people should ever be kind to one another, who had chosen to give away his clothes, his possessions and his home, and who, when his generosity was exhausted, slashed his own throat with a pair of scissors, aged 52. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ever since Charles Darwin had published his theory of evolution in 1859, scientists have pondered whether it can explain the existence of altruism: behaviour that decreases an individual&#8217;s fitness but which increases the average fitness of the group to which he belongs. Such benevolence is not unique to humans but exists also in complex insect societies. Bees, for example, live in colonies headed by a queen and populated by sterile workers. One reading of Darwin&#8217;s theory says that, because the workers do not breed, evolution should result in their elimination. Yet this is not what happens in nature.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the 1960s, Hamilton proposed that evolution acts on characteristics that favour the survival of close relatives of a certain individual. The bee colonies that survive are those in which sterile workers (which are daughters of the queen) provide the &#8220;fittest&#8221; service to their mother. Each worker thus strives to favour the reproductive success of the queen, even at the price of her own reproductive failure.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Price wanted to describe mathematically how a genetic predisposition to altruism could evolve. He devised a formula, now called the Price equation, that describes how characteristics that can, in some cases, prove disadvantageous, nevertheless persist in the population. By tinkering with the variables, he was able to describe populations in which kindness was widespread, everyone benefited and altruism was passed down the generations, and other, more brutal worlds, where charity was abused and kindness died out. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ultimately, Price ended up in such a place. Oren Harman&#8217;s account of his life traces his early years, including a stint at the University of Chicago, where he worked on detecting radiation as his colleagues toiled to produce the first atomic pile. It bounces between his many interests: Price trained as a chemist but worked on electronic transistors at Bell Labs before going into computer-aided design. Then a generous payment from his health insurance for a thyroid tumour enabled him to abandon his wife and two young daughters and move to London in 1967.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There he hooked up with Hamilton and derived the equation for which he is famed. At the same time, his interest in altruism blossomed into something less kin-based and more practical: he began to seek out needy strangers. At one stage, he had four homeless men staying in his flat, while he slept in his office. As he became increasingly unwell, both physically and mentally, he redoubled his efforts to help the poor, moving into a dirty squat where, one freezing night, he committed suicide. As Mr Harman so vividly describes, Price ultimately became one of the vagabonds he had set out to save. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Reviving a Chinese imperial treasure means reversing 80 years of neglect</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | BEIJING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>RESTORING ancient buildings in China often involves tearing down ruins and simply erecting new-looking replicas in their place, with no heed to the original materials or workmanship. Which is one reason why the painstaking makeover of a dilapidated imperial garden in Beijing&#8217;s Forbidden City is so unusual. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Largely closed to the public for more than 80 years, the garden&#8217;s 27 buildings and pavilions, as well as its rockeries and ancient trees, have been described by one senior Forbidden City official as a &#8220;jewel&#8221;&#8212;and with good reason. Restoring them has been the work of a rare partnership between the Palace Museum, which since 1925 has been responsible for the Forbidden City, and a foreign NGO, the New York-based World Monuments Fund. Although the garden occupies less than 1% of the vast imperial compound, reviving it will take nearly two decades and is not expected to be completed until 2019, already three years later than originally planned.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first sign of progress came in November 2008 when work was finished on the Studio of Exhaustion from Diligent Service, or Juanqinzhai. At the northern end of the narrow, 160-metre-long garden, the building was designed by the Qianlong emperor in the late 18th century as a hideaway within a walled-off section of the palace that he had built for his retirement. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Earlier this month, your correspondent was given a rare tour. Qianlong never lived in this mini-Forbidden City, preferring to carry on as China&#8217;s effective ruler even after he had officially stepped down. But Juanqinzhai was designed for a retired emperor to enjoy alone. It has delicate bamboo marquetry and wooden screens with embroidered silk panels. Easily the building&#8217;s most striking feature, its painted silk murals depict a Chinese palace garden in spring with birds and blossoms, all worked with a foreshortening effect that was at the time distinctly European, the style probably inspired by the work of Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian missionary who had painted for the court.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The still-unrestored buildings in the garden reveal the scale of the task ahead. After the last emperor was expelled from the Forbidden City in 1924, most of the garden was shut off to the public, the buildings used for storage. Today they appear little more than dust-blackened shells with wallpaper hanging in tatters and any decorative features encrusted with grime. Over the fragmentary remains of what had once been an 18th-century silk painting a metal pipe had been crudely fastened (some time in the 1990s, said an expert). The garden&#8217;s neglect was anything but benign. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But being left alone also had its advantages. For the first three decades of communist rule in China, the country was cut off from the fast evolving science and philosophy of restoring ancient monuments. The garden was spared irreversible mistakes, which would have been compounded by the near eradication in the Maoist era of the skills and craftsmanship needed. Only in the last few years has the Forbidden City launched its first large-scale restoration work since the collapse of the last imperial dynasty in 1911: in the northwest of the Forbidden City another Qianlong garden complex that burned to the ground in 1923 was restored with funds from Hong Kong. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Forbidden City&#8217;s management has shown a willingness to turn to foreigners for expert advice and financing in a way that Mao Zedong would have abhorred. Juanqinzhai lodge and its adjoining garden are being touted by the Chinese authorities as a showcase of such co-operation. Earlier this month China&#8217;s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, joined Prince Charles at a showing in the British Museum of &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s Secret Garden&#8221;, a documentary sponsored by the Robert Ho Foundation of Hong Kong about the lodge&#8217;s restoration. The film will be aired on Sky in June. Later this year furniture and fittings from the garden will also begin a year-long tour of America, the first such showing outside China. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But restorers have yet to work out how visitors to the Forbidden City will enjoy the finished project. Like the lodge, the garden was not designed to cater for large numbers of people. The visitor must wend his way through massive stone grottoes that reveal a childlike love of little hiding places, where the retired emperor was able to enjoy a rare sense of detachment from the courtly world around him with its cavernous official buildings and vast retinues. In one pavilion he could have climbed up narrow wooden stairs to enjoy a view from an ornate chamber over the Forbidden City&#8217;s golden yellow rooftops that an emperor would rarely get to see in the course of his normal duties. It is breathtaking, but tourists will have to be content with imagining it.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Lena Horne, entertainer, died on May 9th, aged 92</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 20th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TO THOSE few Americans in the 1950s who did not care about race&#8212;who did not quibble about one-thirty-seconds or one-sixty-fourths, and who were happy to share washroom or soda fountain with people of another shade&#8212;Lena Horne was simply one of the most beautiful women in the world. There was something of Audrey Hepburn in her large brown eyes, and of Hedy Lamarr in her tall forehead; her nose was bobbed and cute. But to everyone else Ms Horne, before her beauty was even considered, was black.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> There were ways of saying this gently, of course. She was not coal or piccaninny black; she was &#8220;dusky&#8221;, &#8220;sepia&#8221;, &#8220;milk-chocolate&#8221;, <em>caf\xE9 au lait</em>. At Harlem&#8217;s Cotton Club, where she started her career at 16 as a dancer, she was &#8220;tan and terrific&#8221;, like the others. The MGM Studios in Hollywood, where she went at 24 in 1941, tried to pass her off as a Latina on her contract. A special make-up, called Light Egyptian, would be rubbed on her skin to make her look more coloured: a better match for the ink-black mammies and funny-men around her. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Her race-blind fans would have been prepared to see her star in any show, as elegant, satin-clad and triumphant as she eventually appeared in 1981 in &#8220;The Lady and her Music&#8221; in New York. But to casting directors during segregation she could only be a lady&#8217;s maid or a jungle girl. At best she could star in all-black comedies, as a devil-sent temptress in &#8220;Cabin in the Sky&#8221; (1943), or as the lead in the Broadway musical &#8220;Jamaica&#8221; (1957). She belonged in the piny woods or under the palms. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Because she was lovely, and could sing bewitchingly, she was also allowed a few solo scenes in &#8220;white&#8221; films. There, like &#8220;a butterfly pinned to a column&#8221;, she would deliver a number which could be seamlessly cut when the picture was shown in southern cinemas. Her greatest hope was to be allowed to play Julie, a mulatto, in &#8220;Show Boat&#8221;. But Julie had to fall in love with a white man; so Ava Gardner played her, initially lip-synching to Miss Horne&#8217;s recordings and even made browner with her Light Egyptian. Lena and Ava were friends. But it hurt to the end of her days.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> It hurt all the more because the young Lena did not think of herself as black particularly. Her blood was mixed up on both sides with white European and native American, so that in her black school she was &#8220;yellow&#8221; to her playmates, and was whispered to have a white Daddy. Both blacks and whites felt she was not one of them. Her family&#8217;s social models were the white bourgeoisie; her father, resplendent in a suit with a diamond stick-pin, had told Louis B. Mayer to his face that he didn&#8217;t want his daughter playing maids in Hollywood, because she could have maids of her own. Not that it did any good. At one of her lowest points Miss Horne went to tea with Hattie McDaniel, who had played Mammy in &#8220;Gone with the Wind&#8221;. They ate tiny sandwiches and cakes in her grand drawing room, while Hattie explained that a maid&#8217;s role was her only realistic future on the screen. Pretty soon afterwards, she threw in the acting life. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>A tiger inside</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Singing, though she made her career in it, proved no simpler. She toured with Charlie Barnet&#8217;s all-white band in 1940, sleeping in the band bus when hotels would not take her in, but counted in her repertoire songs like &#8220;Sleepy Time Down South&#8221;, which blacks were expected to sing. She felt forced into jazz, and not much good at it. Although she covered songs by Billie Holiday and Ethel Waters, her neat enunciation, expressiveness and clarity made her sound more like Judy Garland. Waters&#8217;s &#8220;Stormy Weather&#8221; became her theme, but when she sang it&#8212;especially in the film of 1943, against rain-soaked city streets&#8212;she looked, and sounded, somewhere over the rainbow, and closer to Kansas.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The insults she suffered, therefore&#8212;debarred from lodging houses, spat at in the street, forbidden from mixing with white customers&#8212;were all the worse because she did not feel she represented a race, only herself. And conversely, the barriers she broke&#8212;first black star on a long-term contract with a studio, first black on the cover of <em>Motion Picture</em> magazine, first star whose picture could be pinned up by black GIs in their lockers&#8212;gave her neither pride nor joy, because she thought only of the label that had been stuck on her. She was not a symbol, not a credit, not a first this and that, as she cried bitterly in her old age. &#8220;I&#8217;m me, and I&#8217;m like nobody else.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In the 1950s she was blacklisted for her friendship with Paul Robeson, a communist sympathiser; it hampered her career in her best years, though the voice soared on. In the 1960s she campaigned for civil rights, drawn as much to the militancy of Malcolm X as to Martin Luther King&#8217;s non-violence. When a man called her &#8220;nigger&#8221; in a Beverly Hills restaurant she hurled an ashtray, a lamp and several glasses at him, until he bled. She used her white husband, Lennie Hayton, as a whipping boy for her frustration. &#8220;Never hope too hard,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Never pans out.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Miss Horne&#8217;s producers once complained that she opened her mouth too wide to sing. They meant it was a Negro thing. Certainly Miss Horne had a wide, extravagant smile, a real show-stopper. But it was on the face of a tiger. It hid a lifetime of ferocious resentment and regret. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p>In <strong>America</strong>, the number of new houses on which construction began rose to an annual pace of 672,000 in April, 5.8% higher than in March. April&#8217;s rate of housing starts was 40.9% higher than a year earlier.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The inflation rate in the <strong>euro area</strong> was 1.5% in April, up from 1.4% in March, and much higher than the 0.6% recorded in April 2009. But a measure of inflation that excludes food and fuel prices, which are relatively volatile, fell to 0.7% in April from 0.9% in March.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Inflation in <strong>Britain</strong> rose to 3.7% in April from 3.4% a month earlier. April&#8217;s inflation rate was the highest since November 2008.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>America</strong> bucked the rich-country trend of rising inflation. Prices fell by 0.1% in April from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, making it the first month since March 2009 when prices have declined month-on-month. The annual inflation rate slowed to 2.2% in April from 2.3% in March. Excluding food and energy prices, core American inflation was 0.9% in April, the lowest in 49 years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Spain&#8217;s</strong> GDP in the first quarter rose by 0.1% compared with the previous three-month period, but was 1.3% lower than in the first quarter of 2009.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Japan&#8217;s</strong> GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.9% in the three months to the end of March, beating growth of 3.8% during the previous quarter. Industrial growth in March from the previous month was revised upwards, from 0.3% to 1.2%.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>According to Booz &amp; Company, a consultancy, 14.3% of the world&#8217;s 2,500 biggest publicly listed companies got new bosses in 2009. This was marginally lower than 2008&#8217;s turnover rate of 14.4%. The proportion of chief executives forced from office fell to 3.3% last year, its lowest level since 2003, and down from 5.1% in 2008. The financial sector saw the most bloodletting, with 5.2% of bosses fired and a turnover rate of 17.2%. Between 2008 and last year, the turnover of chief executives fell by 2.4 percentage points to 12.4% in North America, and rose slightly in Europe, to 15.2%. But Asian companies outside Japan have become increasingly prone to changing bosses. Turnover was 9.2% in 2007, but rose to 15.3% last year.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>According to Johnson Matthey, a precious-metals trader, global demand for platinum fell by 11.9% in 2009, to 7.04m ounces.

But these supplies&#8212;the bulk of them from South Africa, the world&#8217;s largest producer of the stuff&#8212;were supplemented by 1.41m ounces of recycled platinum, ensuring that there was 285,000 ounces more around than was demanded. There was excess supply in the market for palladium, too. Demand declined by 6.3% to 7.7m ounces, 760,000 ounces less than global supply.
