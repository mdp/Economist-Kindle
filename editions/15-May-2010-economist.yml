    <h1>Britain's accidental revolution</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>David Cameron&#8217;s new coalition government is a gamble. But it could yet prove a surprisingly successful one</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE youngest prime minister in almost two centuries; the first coalition government in 65 years; the first-ever Conservative-Liberal Democrat government: by accident, British history was made in all sorts of ways this week. This newspaper had hoped that the election on May 6th would return a single party&#8212;the Conservatives&#8212;with a strong mandate. But after five days of deal-making and denunciation during which it seemed that a multi-party ratatouille based on a losing Labour Party might take power or a minority Tory government be forced to beg its bread at every vote, the best possible outcome given the ropy electoral numbers has emerged: a formal coalition to implement an agreed agenda containing much of the best in each party&#8217;s manifesto. We welcome it. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Rolling up shirtsleeves</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are two broad challenges for the new government led by David Cameron, the Tory leader, and Nick Clegg, his Lib Dem deputy. The first is fiscal. Within two weeks a joint legislative programme must be presented to Parliament. Within less than two months a new emergency budget is due. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The broad policy outlines are clear&#8212;and pretty good. Supply-side education reform, the strongest policy in the Tory manifesto, is to go ahead, with the desirable addition of the Lib Dem commitment to put quite a lot of extra money into teaching poor children. Moving benefit recipients from welfare to work, a sound Tory (and indeed Labour) policy, will also be pursued. Labour&#8217;s beloved ID cards are to be scrapped, thank heavens, as is the third runway for Heathrow airport. Britain&#8217;s independent nuclear deterrent is preserved. Policies on immigration and Europe show signs of struggle and fudge, but the Tory annual cap on non-European migrants survives and the Lib Dems&#8217; amnesty for those already in Britain does not. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fiscal trade-offs also make sense. Both parties want to put the burden of deficit cutting on lower spending rather than higher taxes. The Lib Dems, however, were disposed to wait until economic recovery was more assured. They have agreed to make a start this year, cutting \xA36 billion ($9 billion). Though only a modest step it is an important one, as Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, underlined this week. Financial markets are hypersensitive to sovereign-debt quality in the wake of Greece&#8217;s troubles. The best way to reassure them that Britain will cut its deficit is to start doing so. The Tories have relinquished their totemic pledge to raise the threshold for inheritance tax, bowing to the Lib Dem desire to lighten taxes on less wealthy workers instead by raising allowances. This is certainly more defensible in the current climate, even if it means the new government must scramble for ways to pay for the more expensive income-tax cut.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This government will be Mr Cameron&#8217;s&#8212;and the calm way he has pushed this deal through will have reassured doubters (during the negotiations he made it ever harder for Mr Clegg to opt for Labour). The Lib Dems will have five people in the cabinet, but the great offices of state remain firmly Tory. Vince Cable, the Lib Dems&#8217; Treasury spokesman, becomes business secretary, in which role his anti-bank and anti-business rhetoric may give rise to some unhappiness. But all in all the division of the spoils seems a good one, and surprisingly free of acrimony.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More divisive will be the new government&#8217;s second challenge: political reform. Among the novelties this election has thrown up, thanks to the non-aggression pact between the two parties, is Britain&#8217;s first fixed-term parliament. It will run for five years unless enough MPs vote for dissolution. A more important, and contentious, issue is the first-past-the-post electoral system, which regularly denies the Lib Dems and smaller parties a share of parliamentary seats commensurate with their share of the vote. Mr Cameron, over the shrieks of most of his party, has promised a referendum on introducing an alternative-vote (AV) system allowing voters to rank candidates by preference. It was the price of coalition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This change in itself falls far short of the proportional representation that Lib Dems would like. But it signals a necessary willingness to debate broader reform. The electoral system is straining to reflect an electorate with increasingly diverse views: the two biggest parties&#8217; share of the vote has dropped from 81% in 1979 to 65% in 2010, yet Tory and Labour MPs will still probably account for 565 of the 650 total. In the coming weeks <em>The Economist</em> will set out its own views on how to reform not just the electoral system but also the House of Lords, party funding and other bits of the political structure. Though they will not themselves advocate change, the Conservatives have opened the door to a fundamental overhaul.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Dave of the thousand days?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some suggest that the new coalition represents a realignment of politics towards the centre-right. That&#8217;s not obviously so: Labour was not wiped out, and many Lib Dems still long for a &#8220;progressive alliance&#8221; of the left. The coalition could break down before the five years expire. Though all 57 Lib Dem MPs approved it, many will oppose the government on individual issues or abstain from voting, and a few may walk altogether. On the Tory side, right-wingers will resist each compromise. A cabinet containing disgruntled folk from both parties will be a nightmare to run. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg may get on well together (see ), but their man-management skills will be sorely tested by their own party members. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, there is much going for this arrangement. The parties will share responsibility for unpopular fiscal decisions, which should make them easier to take. The fact that, together, they have 59% of the vote will help persuade the electorate to accept painful cuts. Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg have struggled to marginalise their parties&#8217; loonier fringes, and their alliance may assist them in that task. They are both sensible, pragmatic types; if anybody can make this deal work, they can.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After 13 years in power, Labour has gone, and not before time. Its replacement looks far sounder that anybody dared hope: a coalition of ideas and people that, on the whole, brings out the best in both parties. For the Tories, for the Lib Dems and for Britain, it&#8217;s a good deal. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p><strong>Britain&#8217;s</strong> general election on May 6th produced an inconclusive result, leaving the Conservatives as the largest party in Parliament but short of an overall majority. After five days of wrangling the Conservatives joined forces with the Liberal Democrats, who came third at the polls, behind Labour, to create the country&#8217;s first coalition government since the second world war. David Cameron is the new prime minister, and Nick Clegg, leader of the Lib Dems, will serve as his deputy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Leaders of the <strong>euro-area</strong> countries agreed on a &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) &#8220;stabilisation fund&#8221;, with IMF help, for troubled countries in the currency zone. The package, designed to stave off speculative attacks, was seen as a triumph for France&#8217;s Nicolas Sarkozy and a defeat for Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mrs Merkel suffered a further blow in North Rhine-Westphalia, <strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> most populous state, where her party&#8217;s ruling coalition lost badly in a regional election. The defeat means that Mrs Merkel will also lose her majority in the Bundesrat, Germany&#8217;s upper house. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An explosion in a coal mine in southern <strong>Russia</strong> killed at least 66 people. There were fears the death toll could rise to 90.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The French National Assembly unanimously passed a non-binding resolution condemning<strong> Islamic veils</strong> that cover the entire face. Legislation outlawing the garment is likely to follow later this month.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>More political violence</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Around a hundred <strong>Iraqis</strong>, nearly all civilians, were killed on May 10th in a rash of bombings around the country, including Basra and Hilla as well as Baghdad, presumably by Sunni jihadists opposed to the new Shia-led order. It was the biggest toll in one day this year, raising sectarian tension when politicians are haggling to form a new government coalition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Five <strong>Iranian </strong>Kurds, one of them a woman, were hanged for alleged terrorism by the Iranian authorities in Tehran&#8217;s Evin prison, probably to warn dissenters of the punishment they may expect.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Indirect &#8220;proximity&#8221; talks between <strong>Israelis </strong>and <strong>Palestinians </strong>resumed via an American intermediary after a gap of 18 months, with Israel&#8217;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, denying that he had tacitly promised to stop building settlements in East Jerusalem or the West Bank. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In <strong>Zimbabwe </strong>Roy Bennett, a senior member of the Movement for Democratic Change, which is in a unity government with President Robert Mugabe, was acquitted of plotting to overthrow him. Mr Bennett claims the charges were politically motivated. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>It doesn&#8217;t bode well for Baduel</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A <strong>Venezuelan</strong> court sentenced Ra\xFAl Baduel, a former defence minister, to eight years in jail on charges of corruption and abuse of power. Mr Baduel was once an ally of Hugo Ch\xE1vez, the president, but became one of his most outspoken critics once Mr Ch\xE1vez began a successful campaign to remove presidential term limits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Laura Chinchilla was inaugurated as <strong>Costa Rica&#8217;s</strong> president. She is expected to continue the centrist policies of her predecessor, \xD3scar Arias, and increase efforts to fight crime.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Porfirio Lobo, the president of <strong>Honduras</strong>, announced that he would not attend a summit between European Union and Latin American leaders on May 18th. A group of South American countries threatened to boycott the event if he went, because he was elected under a coup regime. Mr Lobo will participate in a smaller meeting between the eu and Central America.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mario Villanueva, a former state governor in <strong>Mexico</strong>, became the highest-ranking Mexican politician to be extradited to the United States, on drugs charges. One prosecutor accused him of turning Quintana Roo, on the Yucat\xE1n Peninsula, into &#8220;a virtual narcostate&#8221; in the 1990s. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The UN reported that a target agreed on by governments to reduce significantly the rate of <strong>biodiversity</strong> loss had not been met. The abundance of vertebrate species fell by a third between 1970 and 2006. Nearly a quarter of plant species are threatened with extinction.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The family way</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In an election in the <strong>Philippines</strong> Benigno &#8220;Noynoy&#8221; Aquino, a senator and son of a late president, Corazon Aquino, was poised to become president himself, after taking a commanding lead. He had about 40% of the votes, compared with 25% for his nearest challenger, Joseph Estrada, a former president. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Maoist protesters in<strong> Nepal </strong>called off the general strike they had mounted to demand the resignation of the government. Little progress, however, was made towards meeting the May 28th deadline for drafting a new constitution.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Wan Yanhai,<strong> China&#8217;s </strong>best-known activist <strong></strong>working on AIDS and gay and lesbian issues, left for America, saying official harassment was driving him into exile.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hamid Karzai, president of <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, was given a warm reception in Washington by an American administration anxious to repair relations after a very rocky patch. Barack Obama backed Mr Karzai&#8217;s efforts to reconcile some elements of the Taliban insurgency. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Eric Holder, America&#8217;s attorney-general, said the government had evidence that the <strong>Pakistani Taliban</strong> had helped to &#8220;direct&#8221; the recent failed attempt to set off a bomb in New York&#8217;s Times Square. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Trying to get a handle</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Barack Obama nominated <strong>Elena Kagan</strong> to replace the retiring John Paul Stevens on America&#8217;s Supreme Court. Ms Kagan is currently the solicitor-general and was previously a dean of Harvard Law School. The absence of any experience as a judge was raised by Senate Republicans as a potential stumbling block to her confirmation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the Senate, John Kerry, a Democrat, and Joe Lieberman, an independent, unveiled a compromise <strong>energy and climate-change bill</strong>. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Less than a month after approving a law that cracks down on illegal immigrants in <strong>Arizona</strong>, the state&#8217;s governor signed a bill prohibiting schools from holding classes &#8220;designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group&#8221;. The act is in reaction to a Mexican-American programme in Tucson, which opponents claim teaches Hispanics that they are oppressed by whites. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>Markets responded positively, initially at least, to the &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) stabilisation fund promised for the euro area. But the political independence of the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> came into question after it reversed course on its &#8220;exit strategy&#8221; of gradually unwinding the emergency financial measures it introduced in 2008, and started to buy undisclosed amounts of euro-zone government bonds to soothe &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221; markets. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Hang on to your hats</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>America&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched an investigation into the extreme <strong>stockmarket volatility</strong> on May 6th, in which indices plunged and some blue-chip companies saw their market value fall off the cliff (Accenture traded at one cent a share). The regulators said no single cause had so far been found for the abrupt tumult in markets, which were also jittery about the euro crisis. One line of inquiry focused on automated trading systems. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The turmoil in shares and currency markets thrust investors towards <strong>gold</strong> as a haven, pushing the price of the metal to a new intraday record above $1,240 a troy ounce. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Continued exposure to toxic mortgages led to further huge quarterly losses at <strong>Fannie Mae</strong> and <strong>Freddie Mac</strong>, which were placed into conservatorship in 2008. Fannie requested an extra $8.4 billion from the government, and Freddie asked for another $10.6 billion. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Passing the buck</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Furious senators questioned company executives about last month&#8217;s <strong>oil-well explosion</strong> off America&#8217;s Gulf Coast that killed 11 workers and threatens to cause an environmental catastrophe. BP, which owns the well, blamed Transocean, a contractor, for the failure of a valve system that could have prevented the blowout. Transocean pointed the finger at Halliburton, which was in charge of the cement work to stabilise the rig. Halliburton maintained that BP was ultimately responsible.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A landmark criminal <strong>cartel trial </strong>collapsed in Britain. Four former and current executives at British Airways were accused by the Office of Fair Trading of colluding on fuel surcharges with Virgin Atlantic, which was granted immunity for co-operating with the prosecution. But the case was thrown out when undisclosed e-mail evidence held by Virgin came to light. The OFT said it was &#8220;reviewing the role played by Virgin Atlantic&#8221; and its obligations to the prosecution. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Toyota</strong> surprised analysts by reporting net income of \xA5112 billion ($1.2 billion) for the first three months of the year. The carmaker made a profit despite the launch of several investigations into its safety record and the recall of millions of its vehicles. For its current fiscal year, which ends in March 2011, Toyota expects profit to increase by 48%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>American employers added 290,000 <strong>jobs</strong> to the payrolls in April, the second consecutive month of significant growth. But with more people deciding to rejoin the labour market to find work, the unemployment rate edged back up, to 9.9%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Germany&#8217;s <strong>SAP</strong> agreed to pay $5.8 billion for <strong>Sybase</strong>, an American software company that specialises in software for businesspeople to run applications on wireless devices. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Portugal Telecom</strong> rejected a &#8364;5.7 billion ($7.3 billion) offer from Spain&#8217;s <strong>Telef\xF3nica</strong> to buy its share in the pair&#8217;s mobile-phone joint venture in Brazil. In a country with a growing economy and relatively young population, <strong>Vivo</strong> is Brazil&#8217;s biggest wireless operator, with 54m subscribers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nokia undertook a big management shake-up in an effort to refocus on the high-end <strong>smart-phone market</strong>, where it trails the iPhone, the BlackBerry and devices that operate on Google&#8217;s Android platform. Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s ambitions in the market for smart-phone handsets were dealt another blow when Sprint Nextel became the second American operator to drop Google&#8217;s Nexus One phone. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Shopping in Knightsbridge</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Harrods</strong> got a new owner, its fifth since it began trading in the 1840s. The luxury department store in London was sold to Qatar&#8217;s sovereign-wealth fund for \xA31.5 billion ($2.2 billion) by Mohamed al Fayed, who bought the business in 1985. The Qatari fund has invested heavily in British assets. It is the biggest shareholder in Barclays and J. Sainsbury and holds the second-biggest stake in the London Stock Exchange. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Member nations of the <strong>OECD</strong> voted unanimously to invite Estonia, Israel (over Palestinian objections) and Slovenia to join the body, leading to hopes that those countries could see more foreign investment. The Israeli deputy prime minister recalled his country&#8217;s economic turnaround since the 1980s, &#8220;when we looked worse than Greece today&#8221;. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>No going back</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Ambitious but incomplete, the rescue plan for the euro could change the way Europe is run</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EUROPE&#8217;S &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) plan to defend its single currency may have been received with euphoria, but it was born of despair. When euro-zone leaders gathered over the weekend of May 8th-9th they faced the sickening reality that the fear in southern Europe&#8217;s government-bond markets was spreading to its banking system and beginning to infect global credit markets. This plan was not just about preventing Greece&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis spreading to Portugal and Spain. It was about stemming a growing financial panic that could have plunged the world economy back into the quagmire from which it has spent the past two years struggling to escape.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So European leaders were right to act&#8212;boldly as well as quickly. For once, nobody could accuse them of lacking ambition. They have committed an awesome &#8364;60 billion of EU-backed bonds, a &#8364;440 billion fund guaranteed by euro-zone countries, and potentially up to &#8364;250 billion of IMF money. The European Central Bank (ECB), a pillar of monetary orthodoxy, turned apostate and set about buying government bonds in order to lower the cost of borrowing for the euro zone&#8217;s most troubled economies (see ). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the short term this massive show of financial firepower has worked. Bond markets have calmed; the odds of a cascading series of defaults have diminished. The temptation is to declare victory and move on. Yet the job is not even half-complete. This plan buys time, but it does not repair the fiscal and structural flaws that led the euro zone into this mess in the first place. Worse, it comes with risks attached that Europe urgently needs to deal with. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>What would Monnet have said?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The starting point is to acknowledge that the plan lacks detail. Nobody is exactly sure how the loan guarantee will work or how the IMF will make its money available. That matters because the stopgap until this is arranged is the ECB, which has now started buying government bonds in the open market. The ECB insists that its actions are exceptional, a short-term response to dysfunctional markets and that it is just as independent from bullying politicians as it ever was. That impression, already battered, will be impossible to sustain if the ECB ends up giving a liquidity lifeline to profligate governments for long. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A still larger question is over moral hazard. You do not have to be a German taxpayer to fret that the corollary of giving weaker euro-zone governments refuge from the bond markets is to ease the pressure on them to cut their deficits. Hard-pressed euro-zone governments now know that, if the worst comes to the worst, they have somewhere to run. In the short term that is an invitation to shirk the hard decisions that still lie ahead. In the longer term it is a recipe for the euro zone&#8217;s collapse. Having opted for collective insurance, Europe now needs to develop the collective discipline to stop their reserve fund from being abused. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some safeguards are to be found in the plan itself. Portugal and Spain were persuaded to announce extra fiscal belt-tightening this week. Any country that borrows from the new stabilisation funds will have to agree on an adjustment programme with the IMF, just as Greece already has. If imprudent economies seek cash from the rescue fund, they will have to import discipline from a body that specialises in imposing it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But this will surely not be enough. The euro zone&#8217;s governments must find ways to impose good behaviour long before the profligacy becomes acute. That is the biggest task&#8212;not least because the euro&#8217;s history is replete with failed attempts at doing so. The single currency&#8217;s architects put their faith in the &#8220;no bail-out&#8221; clause coupled with a &#8220;stability and growth pact&#8221;. The rules failed utterly. The sanctions for misbehaviour were not credible: to threaten a deficit-ridden country with huge fines is like chastising a man hanging on to a cliff by treading on his fingers. And too many countries, including the euro zone&#8217;s biggest members, were allowed to flout the rules with impunity. Worse, no one really believed the &#8220;no bail-out&#8221; clause, which is why financial markets for too long failed to distinguish profligate governments from prudent ones. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> What might work instead? The European Commission this week offered some ideas, from more intrusive and early collective monitoring of national budgets to an incentive system where profligacy is punished by withholding EU funds. These are a good start, but they share many of the flaws of the old ones. The euro zone also needs to think about political tools&#8212;denying profligate countries a vote in any euro decisions, for instance. And it needs mechanisms for dealing with failure, such as an orderly system for sovereign-debt restructuring. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>This one will run and run</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hardest of all will be finding the political will to curb profligacy. This struggle will become woven into the conflict that now tugs at the political fabric of Europe. German voters have just shown that they will punish leaders who spend their money bailing out feckless foreigners (see ). Hence the German demand that countries swallow savage budget cuts before they get any money&#8212;a demand that, taken to extremes, could condemn Europe to deflation and stagnation. On the other side, the violence in Greece is a reminder that democratic governments can impose only so much hardship before people rise up. Even if you accept that deficits must fall and economies must modernise, nobody can be completely sure which will come first, economic growth or social rebellion.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The one thing that seems clear is that all this will lead to greater interference in countries&#8217; politics (see ). But what sort exactly? The French have long fought for a communal <em>gouvernement \xE9conomique</em> with wide powers over taxation and monetary policy&#8212;one which would trouble many of its partners (and <em>The Economist</em>). The Germans want a different sort of centralisation, built on rules to punish the profligate. But that demands too little of Germany itself. Just as weak southern-tier economies need to free up their labour and product markets and boost competitiveness, so surplus countries like Germany need to promote spending at home. The scene is set for an ugly political battle over how to run Europe.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The wrecking of Venezuela</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Venezuelans are starting to fall out of love with their president. Will they be allowed to vote him out of power?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> WITH his bellicose bombast, theatrical gestures and dodgy jokes, Hugo Ch\xE1vez, Venezuela&#8217;s president for the past 11 years, has turned himself into one of the world&#8217;s most recognisable and controversial rulers. His fans salute him as a saviour for the downtrodden of the planet, a man who is leading a grass roots revolution against American imperialism and its local sepoys. But to many others, including this newspaper, he has come to embody a new, post-cold-war model of authoritarian rule which combines a democratic mandate, populist socialism and anti-Americanism, as well as resource nationalism and carefully calibrated repression. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This model has proved surprisingly successful across the world. Versions are to be found in countries as disparate and distinct as Iran, Russia, Zimbabwe and Sudan. In one way or another, these regimes claim to have created a viable alternative to liberal democracy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s case, that claim has been backed up above all by oil. On the one hand, he has deployed oil revenues abroad to gain allies, and to sustain the Castro brothers in power in Cuba. On the other, having kicked out Western multinationals, he has signed investment deals with state-owned oil companies. Last month China agreed to lend Venezuela $20 billion, mainly for oil development. Mr Ch\xE1vez has armed his revolution with Russian jets, tanks and rifles (albeit bought on tick). Meanwhile, a Spanish judge accuses his government of sheltering members of ETA, the Basque terrorist group. Intercepted e-mails from leaders of Colombia&#8217;s FARC guerrillas suggest that they have received help, and possibly arms, through Venezuela. Of course Venezuela&#8217;s government denies such claims. So just how much of a menace is Mr Ch\xE1vez, and what, if anything, can be done about him?</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Venezuela&#8217;s dark age</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Certainly his threats against Colombia&#8212;which include a total trade embargo if Juan Manuel Santos, a former defence minister, wins this month&#8217;s presidential election&#8212;and the evidence of his veiled support for the FARC are troubling. They are a constant, if so far manageable, source of regional tension. And his efforts to build a block based on self-proclaimed &#8220;revolutions&#8221;, anti-Americanism and managed trade in the heart of democratic Latin America have served to undermine the very cause of regional integration that he claims to champion. But rhetoric aside, his influence in the region peaked a couple of years ago. He lost one ally, albeit in regrettable circumstances, when Honduras&#8217;s president, Manuel Zelaya, was overthrown last year. Several others are on the defensive. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Much more important is the damage Mr Ch\xE1vez is doing to his own country. His &#8220;21st-century socialism&#8221; is a precarious construction. The brief fall in the oil price of 2008-09 was enough to sink Venezuela&#8217;s economy into stagflation&#8212;even as the rest of Latin America is enjoying vigorous economic recovery. Venezuelans are suffering declining real wages, persistent shortages of staple goods (meat is the latest to become scarce) and daily power cuts. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The blackouts are in part the result of drought. But they are also the most dramatic sign that the bill for a decade of mismanagement of the economy and of public services is now falling due (see ). There are plenty of other ugly portents. In one of the world&#8217;s biggest oil exporters hard currency is running short: to buy a dollar in the tolerated parallel market now requires almost twice as much local currency as the official exchange rate (and three times more than the privileged rate for &#8220;essential imports&#8221;). Investors rate the country&#8217;s debt as the riskiest of anywhere. Crime and corruption are flourishing.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The coming choice between Ch\xE1vez and democracy</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Awkwardly for Mr Ch\xE1vez, all this is happening when he faces a legislative election in September, the prelude to a vital presidential ballot in December 2012. That points to the contradiction at the heart of his project. He sees his revolution as permanent and irreversible. But he derives his legitimacy from the ballot box. He has been elected three times, and won four referendums. He has hollowed out Venezuela&#8217;s democracy, subjugating the courts, bullying the media and intimidating opponents. But he has been unable, or unwilling, to disregard or repress opposition to the same degree as Iran&#8217;s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or even Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin, let alone the Castro brothers in Cuba. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Public opinion still matters in Venezuela. Remarkably, opinion polls show that two Venezuelans out of five still support Mr Ch\xE1vez (higher than the proportion of the British electors who voted for the Conservative Party, the senior partner in the country&#8217;s new coalition government). That is tribute to his skill in convincing the poor that he is their champion, to the opposition&#8217;s mistakes, to years of record oil prices and to the ruthlessness with which he ransacks the economy for the short-term benefit of his supporters. It means he is unlikely to fade away. But provided that the opposition comes up with a plausible alternative, it is not fanciful to imagine that in 2012 Venezuela will face a stark choice: Mr Ch\xE1vez or democracy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All the evidence is that Venezuelans, including many <em>chavistas</em>, are democrats and want to remain so. But Mr Ch\xE1vez is pushing on regardless with his revolution, nationalising ever more businesses, expropriating private properties and selectively locking up or harassing his opponents. So the question increasingly being asked in Caracas is whether Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s rule will end peacefully or not. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The answer will lie largely with Venezuelans themselves. But outsiders, especially in Latin America, can play their part, by urging that the opposition receive guarantees that it can take part both this year and in 2012 on equal terms. That goes particularly for democratic Brazil, whose president, Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, has embraced Mr Ch\xE1vez far more than is desirable for his own country&#8217;s long-term interest. Mr da Silva has helped entrench prosperity, freedom and democracy in Brazil. He should hope the same happens for Venezuela. Mr Ch\xE1vez, unfortunately, is not the man to bring that about.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The winners' dilemma</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Forget Wall Street&#8217;s woes. The emerging-market banks that now lead finance face the industry&#8217;s trickiest task</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ONE of the most patronising demonstrations of the alleged superiority of Western finance came in 2005-06, when China&#8217;s big banks, once part of its communist economic apparatus, floated their shares in Hong Kong. Their prospectuses were in English and stuffed with the Western jargon of shareholder value. Their shares were underwritten by a dazzling array of Western investment banks and bolstered by anchor investments from blue-chip American and European financial firms. The emerging world might have become the factory of the world and its back office. But the globalisation of finance, it seemed, would take place on Western terms.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Things look very different today. Whereas some of those underwriters and anchor investors have been disgraced or bailed out (or both), Chinese banks are the world&#8217;s largest, dwarfing their erstwhile sponsors. Emerging-market banks together account for between a quarter and half of the global industry on most measures (see ). But it is not just the familiar shift in economic weight that has taken place. Emerging economies&#8217; financial systems, long regarded as their Achilles heels, have done far better than the Anglo-Saxon model they were once encouraged to emulate.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Doing things the old-fashioned way</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Emerging-market banks are of the old school, with branches, profits, lowish pay and high capital. After decades of crises, they are tightly regulated: Indian bankers joke that their country&#8217;s red tape is now the envy of regulators worldwide. Thanks to their thrifty customers, banks typically have excellent funding, gathering more in deposits than they lend out, unlike banks in rich debtor countries that rely on fickle international borrowing markets. The state has played an increasingly active role. It owns most of the banking system in China, India and Russia and a growing chunk in Brazil. As part of their efforts to counteract the downturn, governments got state banks to lend more, most notably in China, where new loans in 2009 equated to about a third of GDP. In the big emerging economies the ideal is to have a mixed banking system with a big state presence, some perky private banks, and a few foreigners to keep the locals honest. Only a handful of Western banks, including HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citigroup, have real clout.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So should the world&#8217;s financial template now be Beijing or Mumbai, rather than Wall Street or the City of London? The developing world&#8217;s banks had a good crisis, but their big test is yet to come. Emerging economies face a paradox: they need solid banks to help them grow fast, but fast growth will make their banks less safe. As consumers spend more, banks&#8217; excess deposits may shrink. Business customers will shift their fundraising towards capital markets, forcing lenders to build volatile investment banks. The great push to serve the hundreds of millions of unbanked people, while noble, is just as experimental as Wall Street&#8217;s adventures in subprime debt. And most developing-world banks are keen to punch their weight internationally but are painfully aware of the gruesome mistakes made by Western and Japanese firms abroad.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most importantly, the corollary of fast economic growth is that banks must expand credit at an eye-watering rate. Many executives predict their balance-sheets will double every five years or so. That inevitably creates a risk of bad debts, and having the government involved in allocating credit raises the potential for mistakes and cronyism. China is already grappling with sour loans generated by its lending binge last year. It will be very hard for these banks to satisfy their societies&#8217; sky-high expectations for economic growth without scuppering their own newly won reputations for prudence. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>A bad idea...</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>...whose time may soon come in parts of Europe</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Jack Straw, a British Labour politician, said a few years ago that he would prefer Muslim women to uncover their faces during appointments with him, because he &#8220;felt uncomfortable about talking to someone &#8216;face-to-face&#8217; who [he] could not see&#8221;, liberal opinion was scandalised. He had no more right to request this than he did to ask a teenager to take out a tongue-stud or anything else that might offend middle-aged men: indeed, arguably less because the covering was for reasons of faith, not fashion. Today, however, some European governments are going further than Mr Straw ever wanted to. Starting with Belgium and France, they plan to ban the face-covering niqab or burqa altogether (see ). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Europeans&#8217; hostility to the burqa is understandable. It doesn&#8217;t just deprive them of the beauty of women&#8217;s faces; it offends the secularism that goes deep in European&#8212;and especially French&#8212;culture. Its spread goes hand in hand with the growth of a fundamentalist version of Islam some of whose proponents have attacked the secular societies they live in; and, at a time when those societies feel under threat, the burqa makes it harder for police to identify security risks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For people raised outside the Gulf or Afghanistan, dealing with somebody whose facial expressions are hidden is uncomfortable. Unlike the headscarf, the burqa appears, in itself, to be a restraint on female freedom, and also symbolises what many Europeans see as the repression that women can suffer in Islam. And although many, and probably most, Muslim women wear the headscarf out of choice, some tell the police that they were forced to wear the burqa against their will. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nor do democracies give absolute rights to citizens to wear what they like. The consensus about what is tolerated and what deemed offensive or dangerous varies. People cannot, in most countries, walk the streets naked. And Europeans clearly favour a ban. A recent poll found that a majority backed one in France (70%), Spain (65%), Italy (63%), Britain (57%) and Germany (50%). In America, with its stronger culture of religious freedom, only a minority (33%) was in favour. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Tolerate the burqa with pride</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the very values which Europeans feel are threatened by the burqa demand that they oppose a ban. Liberal societies should let people wear what they want unless there is a strong argument otherwise. And, in this case, the three arguments for a ban&#8212;security, sexual equality and secularism&#8212;do not stand up. On security, women can be required to lift their veils if necessary. On sexual equality, women would be better protected by the enforcement of existing laws against domestic violence than by the enactment of new laws forcing them to dress in a way that may be against their will. On secularism, even if Europeans would prefer not to have others&#8217; religiosity paraded on the streets, the tolerance that Westerners claim to value requires them to put up with it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>European governments are entitled to limit women&#8217;s rights to wear the burqa. In schools, for instance, pupils should be able to see teachers&#8217; faces, as should judges and juries in court. But Europeans should accept that, however much they dislike the burqa, banning it altogether would be an infringement on the individual rights which their culture normally struggles to protect. The French, of all people, should know that. As Voltaire might have said, &#8220;I disapprove of your dress, but I will defend to the death your right to wear it.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Don't shoot the messenger</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>America&#8217;s president joins a long (but wrong) tradition of technophobia</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;WITH iPods and iPads and Xboxes and PlayStations&#8212;none of which I know how to work&#8212;information becomes a distraction, a diversion, a form of entertainment, rather than a tool of empowerment.&#8221; In a speech to students at Hampton University on May 9th, Mr Obama did not just name-check some big brands; he also joined a long tradition of grumbling about new technologies and new forms of media.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Socrates&#8217;s bugbear was the spread of the biggest-ever innovation in communications&#8212;writing. He feared that relying on written texts, rather than the oral tradition, would &#8220;create forgetfulness in the learners&#8217; souls&#8230;they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.&#8221; Enos Hitchcock voiced a widespread concern about the latest publishing fad in 1790. &#8220;The free access which many young people have to romances, novels and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth.&#8221; (There was a related worry that sofas, introduced at the same time, encouraged young people to drift off into fantasy worlds.) Cinema was denounced as &#8220;an evil pure and simple&#8221; in 1910; comic books were said to lead children into delinquency in 1954; rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll was accused of turning the young into &#8220;devil worshippers&#8221; in 1956; Hillary Clinton attacked video games for &#8220;stealing the innocence of our children&#8221; in 2005.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Obama is, at least, bang up to date with his reference to the iPad, which now joins the illustrious list of technologies to have been denounced by politicians, and with his grumbling about the crazy theories circulated by the combination of blogs and talk radio. But such Luddism is particularly curious in Mr Obama&#8217;s case, given that he is surgically attached to his BlackBerry, his presidential campaign made exemplary use of the internet, and he has used YouTube to great effect to deliver his message directly to viewers, circumventing the mainstream media in the process. Presumably all those are examples of good information (the empowering sort) rather than bad (the distracting or misleading sort).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This distinction, of course, is bogus. Anybody who has ever taken a meeting knows that trying to hold the attention of people with BlackBerrys is like trying to teach Latin to delinquent teenagers. And the devices Mr Obama denounces have many constructive uses. Lectures, language lessons and course materials are among more than 250,000 educational audio and video files available on iTunes. iPads and their ilk may yet turn into a practical alternative to textbooks. Video games are widely used as educational tools, not just for pilots, soldiers and surgeons, but also in schools and businesses. And Larry Katz, a Harvard economist, suspects that video games and websites may have kept the young and idle busy during this recession, thus explaining the surprising lack of an uptick in crime.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Devices and desires</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Obama complained that technology was putting &#8220;new pressures on our country and on our democracy&#8221;. But iPods, iPads and suchlike are not to blame for the crazy theories&#8212;about, for instance, politicians&#8217; birth certificates&#8212;that circulate in the blogosphere. People have always traded gossip: the internet just makes it easier and quicker. The culprit is human nature, not technology. And new communications technologies tend to strengthen democracy, not weaken it, as revolutionaries have known ever since Thomas Paine and others used the printing press to argue for American independence.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At least Mr Obama got one thing right: the idea that educating people is the best way to enable them to adapt to technological change, and use it for good. But technology is not an alternative to education and empowerment; it can, in fact, help deliver them. America&#8217;s first web-savvy president should understand that. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>On Britain's election, Israel and Palestine, epilepsy, whaling, honesty, New York, city living, extraterrestrials</h1>\r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <h2>A new kind of politics? </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; I was deeply disappointed by your endorsement of the Conservative Party in the general election (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st). <em>The Economist </em>has always been a passionate advocate for freedom. But championing freedom should mean more than just having reservations about high taxes and big government. According to Amartya Sen, freedom is the capability to lead lives we have reason to value. You described Britain&#8217;s growing public sector as a &#8220;liberty-destroying Leviathan&#8221;, yet state services are also the means through which liberty is ensured for the least advantaged and for those who are discriminated against.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Conservatives&#8217; instinct to reduce inheritance tax suggests the party cares more about the freedom of a select few than the far-greater need of the underprivileged. The opinion of one senior Tory that bed-and-breakfast hotels should be allowed to turn away homosexual couples if they so choose values the freedom to discriminate over the right to equal treatment. And the Conservative plan to encourage marriage through the tax system is an unacceptable invasion of moralism into individual private life. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Your endorsement leader forgot that liberalism is a progressive and not a conservative ideology.</p>\r\n\

    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; It is telling that a centre-right, business-orientated newspaper such as <em>The Economist</em> found little good to say about Conservative economic policy, despite the economy being the number one issue. You also understated Tory failures, such as George Osborne&#8217;s absurd reaction to the nationalisation of Northern Rock, his staunch opposition to economic stimulus, and his pusillanimous move away from &#8220;swingeing&#8221; public-sector cuts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Just coming out with a straight endorsement of the Liberal Democrats would have yielded a much more sensible compromise, as that party&#8217;s positions on Europe, immigration, civil liberties and foreign policy tend to be closer to those of your own. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Oliver Wood-Clark<br>Edinburgh</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; As a teacher during the 1990s and beyond, my experience of the &#8220;golden economic inheritance&#8221; bequeathed by the Conservatives to the Labour government in 1997 included cheaply-built dilapidated schools and a general lack of resources (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th). It is a different world now compared with then, when, in one of the most oversubscribed state schools in the country, I had to abandon my classroom when it rained too heavily, had more pupils than desks, and as a head of department at the school took home \xA3250 ($410) a week. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The new government will no doubt undertake painful cuts, but without the complete failure of public services that undoubtedly would have occurred had they still been operating with gaping 50-year-old infrastructure and resource shortfalls. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tony Fahey<br>Caterham, Surrey</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Your briefing on Labour&#8217;s record (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st) was balanced and fair. However, I was upset at the caption &#8220;Foreign policy going down in flames&#8221; that you used beneath the picture of a British soldier in Iraq, who is set aflame as he escapes from his armoured vehicle. The photo is heart-wrenching. It is a dishonour to the sacrifice of those in uniform that you would make something lighthearted of that image. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Working towards peace</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; Your illogical assertion that President Barack Obama should impose an American peace plan on the Israelis and Palestinians was very troubling for a number of reasons (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st). Your sentiment goes against the president&#8217;s own words, when he quoted James Baker in saying that &#8220;we can&#8217;t want it more than they do&#8221; and acknowledged that progress in the peace process can only be achieved as a result of direct negotiations between both parties.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An imposed solution has no chance of succeeding to create a real and lasting peace. Israel has repeatedly made it extremely clear that it is ready to sit down and engage in direct negotiations; the Palestinians have made it equally clear they are unwilling to take this necessary step. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>While the United States and the international community can play a crucial role in facilitating negotiations, achieving peace requires two willing partners. Israel is eagerly waiting for its partner to show up.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Abraham Foxman<br>National director<br>Anti-Defamation League<br>New York</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>* SIR &#8211; On the face of it, your recommendation that the Obama administration propose a NATO force under American command to secure a Palestinian border with Israel seems reasonable. But scratch beneath the surface and one sees that it would be a disaster in the making. First, NATO forces are simply not up to the job. Except for the United States, NATO members have irresponsibly allowed their military forces to deteriorate for decades. The effects of this neglect is shown in the inability of NATO members to dispatch and sustain military power in Afghanistan. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Second, NATO&#8217;s political leadership might naively judge that intervention would be &#8220;neutral&#8221;, but its troops on the ground would quickly come to be seen as a proxy force for the United States. The Palestinians and Arabs already lambast Washington for being &#8220;pro-Israel&#8221; and they would view NATO as a belligerent and occupational power rather than as a peacemaker. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In short, let the Israelis and the Palestinians defuse their conflict for themselves. NATO would be more prudent to keep its meagre military powder dry for security tasks more central to its core interests, such as in the Balkans or vis-\xE0-vis Russia, which probably do not lie far in the offing. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Defining disability </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; When discussing government in California you referred to an agency that helps &#8220;people suffering from cerebral palsy, epilepsy and other mental disabilities&#8221; (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st). I have epilepsy, which is controlled by daily medication. I am lucky that epilepsy isn&#8217;t a problem for me, though I do find it annoying when publications such as yours describe it as a mental disability. </p>\r\n\

    <h2>Managing whales </h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; Your article on whaling did not mention that the International Whaling Commission&#8217;s global moratorium was created specifically to regulate the industry to a point where sustainable harvests could once again be justified from a scientific perspective (&#8220;&#8221;, May 1st). For many years America and Britain have deliberately blocked IWC scientific committee reports from being adopted. This is because the science indicates that the annual harvest of minke whales is substantially lower than the annual growth rate of pelagic and coastal minke stock. If the reports were released the IWC would no longer have a rationale under its by laws for continuing the temporary moratorium. The whaling nations that founded the IWC did not intend for the moratorium to be permanent.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Furthermore, there appeared to be a definite slant in your reporting. Although terms such as &#8220;tuna catch&#8221; and &#8220;deer harvest&#8221; are typically used in your publication and elsewhere, you chose to employ words like &#8220;slaughter&#8221; and &#8220;killed&#8221; when writing about commercial whaling. </p>\r\n\

    <p>SIR &#8211; I would like to add to the debate about &#8220;whether firms should focus most on their shareholders, their customers or their workers&#8221; (&#8220;&#8221;, April 24th). We shouldn&#8217;t give up on shareholder value as a useful model, but I think there is one thing that needs adding to the mix, which is honesty. Almost all of the instances raised recently of the limitations of shareholder value are examples of dishonesty, not of the failure of shareholder value. The threat of disclosure is a most effective policeman. Here&#8217;s a simple test: would my shareholders accept my choices if they were made public tomorrow?</p>\r\n\

    \r\n\
    <p>SIR &#8211; It may be right that to terrorists &#8220;New York is America&#8221; (&#8220;&#8221;, May 8th). But to most New Yorkers, Times Square does not belong to us; it belongs to the world. It has a European style, with street closings, caf\xE9 tables and chairs, and you are much more likely to hear Hindi, Mandarin, French or Japanese spoken by tourists as you are a fine Brooklyn accent. So it is a bit odd that a clueless terrorist would set his sights on one of the places in America that is least likely to contain a high percentage of Americans. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Clearly the alleged bomber, who went to business school, is neither a genius, nor a reader of your newspaper. For if he were the latter, he would know that his fellow MBAs don&#8217;t need bombs to wreak havoc on New York City. </p>\r\n\

That is an often repeated generalisation tied to the ridiculous clich\xE9 that if you are liberal, young and interested in more than sitcoms you must be overly privileged. Most of us in these &#8220;elite&#8221; cities don&#8217;t care about owning a big house. I am happy paying rent and having less money if my immediate environment is more liveable and convenient. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\

    <h1>Feeling the heat</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The bill for years of mismanagement has come due just as crucial elections loom. The president&#8217;s response has been to start locking up opponents</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | CARACAS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> FROM Parque Central station in Caracas a cable car silently speeds workers, residents and schoolchildren up the hill to Hornos de Cal and then down again to San Agust\xEDn, connecting these areas of self-built slum housing to the city&#8217;s metro system. The bright-red cars bear the names of Venezuelan states or of uplifting notions, such as &#8220;social duty&#8221; or &#8220;socialist morality&#8221;. Hugo Ch\xE1vez, Venezuela&#8217;s leftist president, opened the <em>metrocable</em> in January, proclaiming: &#8220;A socialist revolution has the essential aim of giving to all men and women the greatest possible happiness.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The <em>metrocable</em>, of just 1.8km, took three years to build and cost $318m&#8212;over ten times as much as a longer line opened in Medell\xEDn, in Colombia, in 2004. But the local leaders of communal councils&#8212;the grassroots groups that Mr Ch\xE1vez conceives as the driving force of his &#8220;Bolivarian revolution&#8221;&#8212;are indeed happy. &#8220;I never thought we would have such a big project in my community,&#8221; said Mar\xEDa Eugenia Ram\xEDrez. &#8220;I thought it was just a dream.&#8221; Ms Ram\xEDrez now has a paid job informing passengers how the system works. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The <em>metrocable</em> is not the only improvement Mr Ch\xE1vez has brought to San Agust\xEDn. Near Hornos de Cal station there is a primary health post, staffed by Cuban doctors, though it is open only in the morning, and a second-tier health clinic, complete with an intensive-care unit. Some of the shacks on the hillsides have had a recent coat of paint, in the regulation colours of another government project (red, yellow, blue or pink). Others were knocked down to make way for the lavish <em>metrocable</em> stations. Their residents were rehoused in new blocks of flats built by Misi\xF3n H\xE1bitat, yet another government scheme. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The communal councils&#8212;there are 27 of them in San Agust\xEDn, one for every 500 families or so&#8212;have given people &#8220;a sense of belonging&#8221;, says Ms Ram\xEDrez. Each council has half-a-dozen subcommittees and a wish-list of projects, ranging from football pitches to the installation of sewage systems or walls to prevent mudslides. Ms Ram\xEDrez and her fellow leaders say that it is often hard to get residents to attend council meetings, and to get ministries to respond to their needs. Nevertheless, she remains a committed supporter of Mr Ch\xE1vez. &#8220;I like his message and the firm way he gives it,&#8221; she says. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For five years or so&#8212;after he saw off a brief coup in 2002 and then survived a prolonged general strike&#8212;this formula of lavish social programmes and make-work schemes in poorer areas, as well as an unequalled ability to communicate with ordinary Venezuelans, served Mr Ch\xE1vez well. When he was first elected in 1998, the price of oil, Venezuela&#8217;s main export, was around $10.50 per barrel. As the price soared, he benefited from a huge windfall. Public spending increased massively. Much money went on subsidies, state job-creation schemes and social programmes, many of them designed by Cuban advisers. As the economy boomed, the share of Venezuelans living in poverty fell from 49.4% in 1999 to 27.6% in 2008, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> By contrast, the opposition&#8217;s shortcomings had been cruelly exposed when it governed in an era of low oil prices in the 1980s and 1990s. Because ordinary Venezuelans felt a rapport with Mr Ch\xE1vez, they did not blame him for the steady rise in violent crime which has turned Caracas into the most violent capital in South America, nor for the corruption that has flourished unchecked under his rule.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s star reached its apogee in a presidential election in 2006, when he easily won another six-year term. He gained 63% of the vote; Manuel Rosales, for the opposition, managed only 37%. Mr Ch\xE1vez took this as a green light for radicalisation. In the first seven years of his rule he behaved like a traditional Latin American populist <em>caudillo</em>, such as Argentina&#8217;s Juan Per\xF3n. (Like Per\xF3n, Mr Ch\xE1vez is a former army officer turned civilian politician; he himself led a failed military coup against a democratic government in 1992.) From 2007 onwards, Mr Ch\xE1vez has claimed to be installing &#8220;21st-century socialism&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Two setbacks followed: he narrowly lost a referendum on constitutional reforms that, on paper, would have taken Venezuela close to Cuban-style communism; and in regional elections in 2008 the opposition recovered to win 46.5% of the vote and important mayoralties, such as Caracas. Mr Ch\xE1vez fought back, calling and winning another, narrower, referendum early in 2009 abolishing term limits. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>From boom to slump</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But for the time being the Bolivarian revolution (named after Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar, South America&#8217;s independence hero) faces unprecedented difficulties. Everyday life is getting harder for Venezuelans. While the rest of Latin America is recovering strongly from the world recession, Venezuela is slumped in stagflation. The boom came to an abrupt end when the oil price plunged in the later months of 2008. Although it has since risen again strongly, Venezuela&#8217;s economy has not (see chart). Mr Ch\xE1vez last month accepted that it &#8220;could&#8221; shrink again this year, confounding earlier official forecasts of growth. The IMF projects a contraction of Venezuela&#8217;s GDP of 2.6% this year, after a fall of 3.3% last year. By March, average wages (allowing for inflation) were 15% below their peak of 2007. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In January Mr Ch\xE1vez unexpectedly ordered a devaluation, after five years in which the bol\xEDvar had been officially fixed at 2.15 to the dollar. Under a new multiple exchange-rate system, priority imports of food and medicine are paid for at 2.60, with 4.30 for other officially authorised imports and a &#8220;parallel&#8221; (ie, market) rate for the rest (now around eight bol\xEDvares to the dollar). This will increase inflation, which is now over 30%&#8212;prices shot up by 5.2% in April alone. But it provides a temporary boost to the state&#8217;s finances, since hard-currency revenue from oil exports instantly became worth twice as much in bol\xEDvares. And that gives Mr Ch\xE1vez the chance to throw money around: pay rises for the army, for example.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The short-term fix of devaluation only underlines the deterioration in the economy. That recession has become slump is mainly the result of years of government mismanagement. The problems start with PDVSA, the national oil company, which Mr Ch\xE1vez has turned into a social-development agency. Not only is its budget raided for social projects; it has also set up subsidiaries to produce, import and distribute food. More than 100,000 people are now on PDVSA&#8217;s payroll, up from 37,942 when the government seized control of the company after the 2003 strike. But oil output has fallen, from a peak of 3.5m barrels per day in 1998 to perhaps around 2.8m now, reckons Tamara Herrera of the Venezuela office of Global Source Partners, a consultancy. That is less than the government says, but more than OPEC calculates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Venezuela is still sitting on 100 billion barrels of oil, the largest reserves outside the Middle East, according to research by BP, a British oil company. Having scrapped deals under which multinational oil companies partnered PDVSA, Mr Ch\xE1vez has this year signed contracts with China and Russia for investment in the Orinoco heavy-oil belt. These could boost production in the next few years. But it is unclear how much cash will in fact be invested.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The private sector is increasingly persecuted. Since the 2006 election Mr Ch\xE1vez has nationalised the main telecoms, steel and cement companies, the Caracas electricity distributor, and a string of oil-service and food companies. The latest is Exito, a Franco-Colombian chain of hypermarkets taken over in January. Other private firms have faced more aggressive regulation, including price controls and difficulties in getting dollars for imports. Unsurprisingly, few are investing. Many of the nationalised firms are poorly run. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most dramatic sign of government bungling is electricity rationing. Since the start of the year many towns and cities have suffered daily power cuts of two hours or more, as well as unscheduled blackouts that sometimes last several times as long. Mr Ch\xE1vez has spared the capital power cuts, apparently out of fear of social unrest. Instead, businesses and homes must reduce their electricity use by 20% on pain of higher charges or loss of supply. Many government departments close in the afternoons to save power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Ch\xE1vez rightly points out that the immediate cause of the electricity rationing is a severe drought brought about by the El Ni\xF1o weather pattern. This has cut output at three hydroelectric dams on the Caron\xED river in the south-east. But, in past droughts, thermoelectric plants came to the rescue. The difference is that Venezuela now depends on hydroelectricity for around 70% of its power, and most of that comes from the vast Guri dam.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The president claims that his government has invested $16.5 billion in electricity generation since 2002. But thermal generation capacity has barely risen. According to V\xEDctor Poleo, a former official in the energy ministry, only a fraction of the money has actually been spent. He blames the rationing in large measure on &#8220;the misappropriation of funds.&#8221; The biggest thermal plant&#8212;Planta Centro at Mor\xF3n, on the Caribbean coast&#8212;is in bad shape. Only two of its five generators actually produce electricity. The national grid is so rickety that it would in any case be unable to cope were the power stations to produce at full capacity. Lack of gas (due partly to lower oil production) means new thermal stations will have to run on fuel oil or diesel, cutting PDVSA&#8217;s export earnings.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As the water level in Guri&#8217;s reservoir dropped perilously close to the point at which the plant would have to be shut down, opposition politicians warned that the country faced &#8220;collapse&#8221;. Mr Ch\xE1vez responded in March that it would rain &#8220;because God is Bolivarian&#8221;. Maybe so; for it began to rain in April, and the threat of a total shutdown of Guri seems to be receding. The government is now scurrying to increase thermal generation, but electricity supply will not get back to normal before the end of the year, concedes Roy Daza, a member of the National Assembly for the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). Much economic damage has already been inflicted. State-owned iron, steel and aluminium plants in the Guayana region have cut output&#8212;by 37% in the case of Venalum, an aluminium producer.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>State harassment</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not surprisingly, all these problems have taken a toll on Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s popularity. According to Luis Vicente Le\xF3n of Datan\xE1lisis, a polling firm, the president&#8217;s approval rating fell from around 60% in February 2009 to 43% a year later&#8212;its lowest level since 2003. For the first time since then slightly more people say they identify with the opposition than with Mr Ch\xE1vez, though 45% support neither side. Awkwardly for the president, this comes as he faces legislative elections on September 26th. In a normal democracy the opposition might be expected to cruise to a majority in the National Assembly. But Venezuela is not a normal democracy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The opposition chose to boycott the previous election for the National Assembly, in 2005. It now recognises that was a costly mistake. Even before that, Mr Ch\xE1vez had seized control of the courts. Since then he has been able to pass laws almost at will. The result, in the careful prose of a recent report by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, is &#8220;the absence of due separation and independence between the branches of government in Venezuela&#8221;. It notes that more than half of judges lack tenure, and so can easily be removed if they rule against the government. The commission says that &#8220;the state&#8217;s punitive power is being used to intimidate or punish people on account of their political opinions.&#8221; And it adds that harassment and intimidation of journalists and media outlets have restricted freedom of speech. The government&#8217;s response to all these criticisms is that the courts are independent and that the Inter-American commission is biased.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Before the regional elections 260 candidates (nearly all from the opposition) were arbitrarily disqualified. Several prominent opposition figures have faced criminal charges. This month General Ra\xFAl Baduel, a former army commander who restored Mr Ch\xE1vez to power after the 2002 coup, was jailed for eight years for corruption&#8212;charges he denounced as politically inspired. Mr Rosales has also been charged with corruption and is in exile in Peru. In March Oswaldo \xC1lvarez Paz, a former opposition governor, was jailed and Guillermo Zuloaga, the manager of Globovisi\xF3n, the last remaining opposition TV station, was charged, both for making critical comments about the president. Scores of radio stations sympathetic to the opposition have had their licences cancelled. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Other kinds of opponents face bullying. \xD3scar Garc\xEDa Mendoza, a banker who is critical of the government, was hauled off for six hours of questioning after he launched a campaign to defend private property last year. Cecilia Garc\xEDa, the rector of the Central University in Caracas, told <em>El Universal</em>, a newspaper, that the university has suffered more than 20 violent attacks since late 2008, and the powerful student movement that has emerged to defend democracy faces intimidation either from the police or from <em>chavista </em>gangs. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>After the opposition&#8217;s strong performance in the 2008 regional elections, Mr Ch\xE1vez curbed local government. In some cases this was done crudely. Antonio Ledezma, who was elected as mayor of Caracas, found his offices occupied by <em>chavista</em> activists, and most of his functions transferred to a government-appointed official. Much the same has happened to the state governor of T\xE1chira. All state governors, whether <em>chavista</em> or from the opposition, have lost powers and money to the centre on the one hand, and to the communal councils on the other. A decree of March 2009 stripped state governments of responsibility for ports, airports and roads. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Pablo P\xE9rez, opposition governor of the western state of Zulia, says that his budget has been cut by a third in real terms. His administration was building a motorway from Maracaibo, the state capital and Venezuela&#8217;s second city, westward towards Caracas. This now ends abruptly after 30km. The only thing the government has done is abolish the tolls on the motorway. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr P\xE9rez, a young lawyer, is one of a new breed of opposition leaders. They are more pragmatic, and less identified with the discredited pork-barrel politics of the pre-Ch\xE1vez era. After years of squabbling, the opposition has also made a big effort to unite for the legislative election. This month it used primaries to put the finishing touches to a single slate of candidates.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Motherland, socialism or death</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Unusually, <em>chavismo</em> now looks more divided than its opponents. In February Henry Falc\xF3n, the popular <em>chavista</em> governor of Lara state, left the ruling PSUV. Mr Falc\xF3n objects to the centralisation of power and to the arbitrary expropriation of an industrial site in his state.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His defection points to tensions within <em>chavismo</em>. One is between social democrats, such as Mr Falc\xF3n, who defend the constitution, and authoritarian socialists who are happy to ride roughshod over it. Another is between civilian leftist idealists and the &#8220;boligarchs&#8221;&#8212;a group of leading <em>chavistas</em>, many of them former army officers, who have profited from Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s rule and from his government&#8217;s corruption. Such tensions may grow if money remains scarce in Venezuela. Mr Le\xF3n, the pollster, points out that Mr Ch\xE1vez is trying to change &#8220;an instrumental relationship with the masses&#8221;&#8212;based on handouts and economic growth&#8212;into an ideological one. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Government buildings are now adorned with <em>Patria, socialismo o muerte</em> (&#8220;Motherland, socialism or death&#8221;), adapted from a slogan coined by Fidel Castro in the early years of the Cuban revolution half a century ago. Last month Mr Ch\xE1vez presided over a parade by some 35,000 members of a militia he has organised, and called on them to defend his revolution with their lives if necessary. In the penumbra of <em>chavismo</em>, there are several small armed ultra-left groups of more or less lumpen character. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All this may intimidate, but it also alienates. &#8220;Venezuelans are naturally left-of-centre,&#8221; says Ibsen Mart\xEDnez, a novelist and writer of soap operas. &#8220;They think the state should do a lot, because it has lots of oil money, and because they are egalitarian. But they don&#8217;t like confrontation or threats to everyone getting along together.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s authoritarianism is carefully calibrated. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t a conventional dictatorship,&#8221; says Teodoro Petkoff, a newspaper editor who was a guerrilla leader in the 1960s, founded a socialist party and is now an opponent of Mr Ch\xE1vez. &#8220;It&#8217;s an authoritarian government with a strong military element that doesn&#8217;t hide its intentions to control society behind a democratic fa\xE7ade.&#8221; But public opinion still matters, he adds, and society holds strong democratic values.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So it is hard for Mr Ch\xE1vez to dispense with elections, or openly rig them. But the government will use &#8220;all manner of tricks&#8221; to sway the legislative ballot, says Eduardo Semtei, a former member of the electoral authority who is also a former <em>chavista</em>. These include exploiting the resources of the state, the captive vote of 2.8m public employees (in an electorate of 17.5m), the possible disqualification of opponents and, already, a change in the electoral rules and boundaries that favours the PSUV. On top of that, Mr Ch\xE1vez is a formidable campaigner, and he has his war-chest of devalued bol\xEDvares at the ready.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The opposition also faces obstacles of its own making. &#8220;There are a lot of discontented <em>chavistas </em>but they don&#8217;t come over to us because they are sceptical of the opposition,&#8221; admits Mr P\xE9rez, the governor of Zulia. &#8220;To rebuild the country we need that <em>chavista</em> world.&#8221; All this means the opposition may not win a legislative majority in September. But if it can offer a positive alternative to Mr Ch\xE1vez&#8217;s gradual destruction of his country, it will knock a large dent in his near-monopoly of power. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Cracking the Kagan code</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Barack Obama knows Elena Kagan well. To most other Americans, she is a mystery</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIXTEEN years ago a young scholar complained that the confirmation process for Supreme Court justices had taken on &#8220;an air of vacuity and farce&#8221;. Senators failed to ask hard questions. Nominees refused to give substantive answers. Ruth Bader Ginsburg dodged every query as either &#8220;too specific&#8221; (meaning, roughly, anything that might have some bearing on a case that might some day come before the court) or &#8220;too general&#8221; (roughly, anything else worthy of mention). Let&#8217;s bring back the kind of grilling to which Judge Robert Bork was subjected in 1987, wrote Elena Kagan. She must be kicking herself. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Barack Obama nominated Ms Kagan to the Supreme Court on May 10th. Having excoriated Justice Ginsburg for refusing to give straight answers, she will look hypocritical if she does the same. Yet Ms Kagan must have noticed that Judge Bork, who made no secret of his views, was not confirmed, whereas the clam-like Justice Ginsburg was, by 96 votes to three. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The nominee&#8217;s career has been marked by frenzied networking and few publicly expressed opinions. She is a pal of nearly every Democrat who counts. She met Mr Obama when he was a humble law lecturer, and is now his solicitor-general. She worked in Bill Clinton&#8217;s White House, and also briefly for then-Senator Joe Biden. She clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, a liberal hero. Larry Summers, who was then the boss of Harvard, made her dean of its law school. He is now Mr Obama&#8217;s top economic adviser. All these bigwigs think Ms Kagan is hot stuff. Conservative academics find her pleasant, too. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But for those below Olympus, she is a mystery. She has never been a judge, so she has no paper trail of rulings. Given her talents, she has written relatively little, and that little has been cautious and analytical rather than bold and prescriptive. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anyone who has had a conversation with her in which she expressed a personal conviction on a question of constitutional law in the past decade,&#8221; says Tom Goldstein, a legal blogger who nonetheless supports her. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Her weakest spot is that when she led Harvard Law School, she barred military recruiters from campus in protest at the military&#8217;s ban on openly gay soldiers. This infuriates middle America. Even people who think the ban on gays in uniform is unjust are affronted that the nation&#8217;s top law school should actively discourage its students from serving their country. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ms Kagan protests that she was only enforcing a long-standing anti-discrimination policy, that the recruiting ban was not absolute and that she loves the military really. But to many, her excuses will sound rather lawyerly. And though she described the gay ban as &#8220;a moral injustice of the first order&#8221;, she backed down when the university&#8217;s federal funding was threatened. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Republicans are already roasting her for this episode. They are also carping about her New Yorkiness&#8212;she did not learn to drive a car until her late 20s&#8212;and her supposed isolation from the lives of ordinary Americans. John Cornyn, a Republican senator from Texas, grouched that she has &#8220;spent her entire professional career in Harvard Square, Hyde Park [the posh Chicago neighbourhood where Mr Obama also lived] and the DC Beltway.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On more substantial matters, however, Republicans have little to shoot at. Sooner or later, the court will hear a challenge to Mr Obama&#8217;s health reform. The constitution empowers Congress to &#8220;regulate commerce...among the several states&#8221;. Many conservatives think it a stretch to say this means the federal government can force people to buy health insurance, especially when some state governments object. Mr Obama would hardly pick a Supreme Court justice who deemed his greatest domestic accomplishment unconstitutional, but outsiders can only guess how Ms Kagan would interpret the commerce clause more generally. Since many of the powers the federal government has assumed since the 1930s rest on an expansive definition of interstate commerce, this matters. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On social issues, Ms Kagan is clearly liberal, but how liberal? She once wrote that &#8220;there is no federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage,&#8221; but it was clear from the context that she was describing the current Supreme Court&#8217;s views, not necessarily her own. She once advised Bill Clinton to accept a ban on late-term abortions as part of a compromise. Pro-choicers were outraged when this surfaced. But pro-lifers say the ban had such a broad exception for the mother&#8217;s health that it would not have criminalised any abortions at all had it been enacted, which it wasn&#8217;t. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Liberals have doubts about her, too. Some accept Mr Obama&#8217;s word that she is one of them. Others recall that the last nominee about whom so little was known turned out to be roughly the opposite of what the president who nominated him promised. Granted, George Bush senior did not know David Souter personally, whereas Mr Obama knows Ms Kagan very well. But some liberals are still disgruntled. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Jonathan Turley, a law professor, calls the nomination &#8220;a terrible act of betrayal&#8221;, because Ms Kagan is insufficiently protective of free speech (she supports restrictions on obscenity) and takes too expansive a view of executive power. During her confirmation as solicitor-general, she agreed with a Republican inquisitor that America is at war with terrorists, and she appeared to agree that an al-Qaeda financier captured in, say, the Philippines, can be held indefinitely as an enemy combatant. This suggests she would be sympathetic to Mr Obama&#8217;s claim of almost Bush-like powers over terrorist suspects. Once she has a job for life on the court, she may reveal what she really thinks. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Hug them tight</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>America makes up with the wayward Afghan leader</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE chandeliers sparkled, a navy jazz band played and the fruit juice (no alcohol) flowed copiously. America spared no effort to welcome Afghanistan&#8217;s president, Hamid Karzai. America, declared Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, would remain committed to Afghanistan &#8220;long after the combat troops have left&#8221;. Afghans remembered their friends, she noted, and &#8220;We are your friend.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Such an embrace marks a striking change in America&#8217;s dealings with the wayward Mr Karzai: a &#8220;love bomb&#8221;, as one guest put it, in place of the tough love, or plain hectoring, of recent months. Just weeks ago, after Barack Obama&#8217;s trip to Kabul, relations seemed to be at breaking point. American officials complained of Mr Karzai&#8217;s failure to curb corruption. One was quoted as threatening to place his half-brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, Kandahar&#8217;s power-broker, on the kill-or-capture list. Mr Karzai, in turn, railed against his protectors. He accused them of trying to rob him of power and told parliament he might even consider joining the Taliban.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> With America planning to start drawing down military forces next year, Mr Obama has decided that the best way to create a working government, able to take charge of security, is to support Mr Karzai rather than denounce him. The recriminations of the past months, declared Richard Holbrooke, America&#8217;s special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, &#8220;are all over&#8221;. Now the two sides are working towards a long-term &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> American officials accuse Mr Karzai&#8217;s government of being dysfunctional, yet the Afghan leader might say the same of the Obama team. The American commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, who successfully lobbied for a large troop increase, has gone out of his way to build up Mr Karzai&#8217;s role as leader. But the American ambassador to Kabul, Karl Eikenberry (himself a former general in Afghanistan), opposed the surge, declaring in a leaked memo that Mr Karzai was not an &#8220;adequate strategic partner&#8221;. Plainly, the two men have failed to recreate the successful partnership in Iraq of General David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker. Things have scarcely been better in Washington, dc.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> For now, though, American officials have fallen into line. Mr Holbrooke, whose relations with Mr Karzai have been unhappy, was dispatched to greet the Afghan leader at the airport; Mr Eikenberry professed his respect for Mr Karzai and his friendship with General McChrystal. Mr Karzai, for his part, made a graceful show of gratitude, visiting maimed soldiers at the Walter Reed military hospital. Over the four-day trip he was due to visit the White House, Congress and Fort Campbell, home of the 101st airborne division which will soon be deploying to Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Karzai was encouraged to bring a large delegation of a dozen cabinet members, among them the ministers of foreign affairs, defence and finance, and the intelligence chief. America&#8217;s aim is not just reconciliation with Mr Karzai, but closer institutional links, so the Afghan ministers spent hours huddled with their American counterparts.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The strategic partnership is designed to address two Afghan neuroses: that America will abandon Afghanistan, and that it will stitch up a deal with Pakistan behind Mr Karzai&#8217;s back. America is sending the message that the troop draw-down will be cautious and &#8220;conditions-based&#8221;. Under a formal declaration to be signed later this year, America will remain deeply involved through economic assistance, political support and military training. Moreover, the new partnership is a mirror-image of a similar encounter with Pakistan in March: Afghanistan is being treated as equal rather than subordinate to Pakistan.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> American officials speak optimistically about the partnership with Pakistan, but old suspicions are returning after the failed attempt to set off a bomb in New York&#8217;s Times Square on May 1st. The alleged bomber, a Pakistani-American, told investigators he had been trained in Pakistan&#8217;s frontier region. The attorney-general, Eric Holder, pinned the blame on the Pakistani Taliban. This is an embarrassment to officials who had at first dismissed the Pakistani Taliban&#8217;s claim to be behind the attack. But it preserves a united front with the Pakistani authorities, who have been fighting the Pakistani Taliban in the Swat valley and South Waziristan, while leaving the Afghan Taliban largely untouched.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> America wants the Pakistani army to move into North Waziristan, a haven for a militant amalgam of Taliban factions, al-Qaeda, and Uzbek and Kashmiri extremists. In public, at least, American officials say they recognise that Pakistani forces are overstretched. For now the only action in North Waziristan comes from American drone strikes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> As with Mr Karzai, the Obama team hopes that public friendship with Pakistani leaders will bring better results than hostility. But in an interview for CBS&#8217;s &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221;, broadcast at the weekend, Mrs Clinton delivered a stern warning of &#8220;very severe consequences&#8221; if Pakistan-based extremists were ever to stage a successful attack in America. Even more than the jazz at the State Department, that will have been music to Mr Karzai&#8217;s ears. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Once more unto the breach</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A new energy and climate bill appears in the Senate. Does it have a chance?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;KERRY-GRAHAM-LIEBERMAN&#8221;&#8212;it sounded so promising. One Democrat, one Republican and one independent (senators John, Lindsey and Joe) have been busily writing a new energy and climate bill taking in ideas from both sides of the partisan aisle. Alas, the unity was shattered last month when Mr Graham, the Republican, refused to come to the bill&#8217;s press launch, after hearing that the Senate would consider immigration first. Then the spill in the Gulf of Mexico fouled the waters: one of the bill&#8217;s key elements is an expansion of domestic offshore oil exploration. Mr Graham says the bill does not have the votes, though he may still vote for it. Messrs Lieberman and Kerry unveiled it nonetheless, on May 12th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The new bill makes extensive changes to earlier versions, which have been marooned in the Senate for more than a year. They are mostly aimed at deferring the economic pain, and offering treats to woo Republicans who are wary of an enterprise that, along with health-care reform, has been one of Barack Obama&#8217;s most cherished goals. Two-thirds of the revenue raised by the proposed bill from the sale of carbon permits is to go to reducing electricity customers&#8217; bills straight away. From 2026, that money will return to customers as cash.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the supply side, power-generating utilities are to get a long phase-in period, with generous initial allowances to emit CO\xB2; these taper away until 2030, when all emissions permits must be bought. Expansive nuclear-power and &#8220;carbon capture and storage&#8221; (CCS) provisions have been retained from earlier drafts of the bill. Near-zero-carbon nuclear power is popular with conservatives, while unproven CCS is meant to seduce the many coal states. In short, goodies all round. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But offshore drilling may get the most attention in coming weeks. Those focusing on building a consensus consider the spill a rarity that can be avoided in future, and stress using more American oil, rather than importing it from unfriendly climes. The bill would require tougher preliminary studies of the impact of spills, and lets states block new drilling up to 75 miles off their coast. (The incentive not to is that those states get 37.5% of the oil revenue.) But opponents of new offshore drilling include both of New Jersey&#8217;s senators and Bill Nelson of Florida, all Democrats. The bill will need several Republican votes to pass, with Democrats already one vote shy of a filibuster-proof majority. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Aside from Mr Graham&#8217;s, can it get them? The bill&#8217;s title (the &#8220;American Power Act&#8221;) obscures a crucial fact: it is still a cap-and-trade bill that seeks to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 17% on 2005 levels by 2020, and 83% by 2050. Many Republican senators still consider this a job-killing energy tax. Messrs Kerry and Lieberman have tried to be generous, and aides called the bill an invitation to further negotiation. But any change that can win one vote may lose another. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How many minds can be changed may depend on the spill&#8217;s progress (see next story). If the weather keeps the spill from devastating the coast, the bill&#8217;s chances are improved. Not since Hurricane Katrina have the political winds depended so much on the real ones.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Still spilling</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Explanations are forming, but answers are missing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | NEW ORLEANS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN AUGUST 2008 Plaquemines Parish, in south-eastern Louisiana, released a report on the area&#8217;s progress since Hurricane Katrina, three years earlier, and its future prospects. &#8220;Plaquemines&#8221;, it said boosterishly, &#8220;is positioning itself to become a premier support area for deep-water exploration in the eastern Gulf.&#8221; The industry has brought thousands of high-paying jobs to the coast, and helped the area weather the downturn better than most places. In March unemployment in the nearby Houma area was just 4.6%; the national rate was more than twice that. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now deep oil is providing more employment to the Gulf coast&#8212;but not in a good way. As of this week more than 13,000 people, and about 460 boats, were working to contain and clean up oil leaking from the well drilled by the Deepwater Horizon, a rig leased to the oil company BP that sank on April 22nd. Some of those struggling with the oil are shrimpers, crabbers and oystermen who would otherwise be jobless, since fishing has been halted more or less all along the coast. But the clean-up cannot absorb all the harm done to the economy. Perhaps 12,000 people have approached state job centres in the past few weeks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The oily sheen now covers some 2,500 square miles (6,500 sq km). The coastguard says that oil is being added at a rate of 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) per day, an estimate which is hard to assess. Four million gallons of oily water have been skimmed from the sea, and 1.4m feet of buoyant plastic booms have been unfurled to try to manage the situation. A more ambitious scheme under discussion would use dredgers to build a new set of barrier islands in front of the delicate marshes of the Mississippi delta. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> BP has tried to control the flow by activating the sea-floor blowout preventer, a stack of valves which should have dealt with the problem in the first place, but was allegedly defective, and by lowering a &#8220;cofferdam&#8221; over the leak to funnel oil to ships at the surface. Neither approach has worked. The next intervention will use a new, smaller cofferdam which by dint of its smaller size and the use of some chemical additives may not clog up with an icy slurry of methane hydrates, as the previous one did. A variety of schemes to either block up or seal off the blowout preventer are in development. If none of them works, a relief well, which would block the leaking well at great depth, should do the job. One is already being drilled, and another is due to be started soon. But drilling such wells takes months. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> On May 11th executives from BP trooped to Washington for a Senate committee hearing on the spill. As BP led the consortium which owned the well and was leasing the rig, it is responsible for the spill&#8212;and therefore liable for the costs of cleaning up and some third-party damages. Federal law caps a spiller&#8217;s liabilities at $75m, puny given the scale of the disaster. BP has already spent $450m on drilling relief wells, preparing the clean-up and giving grants to states; it has promised to pay all &#8220;legitimate&#8221; damages. The company seems keen to pass some blame to Transocean, which owned and operated the rig, and Halliburton, which had been contracted to insert cement into the well to stabilise it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Also under scrutiny is the Minerals Management Service (MMS), the part of the Department of Interior that oversees offshore drilling. MMS is awkwardly tasked both with issuing permits for the industry and with regulating it. In this case, MMS officials approved the blowout preventer that then failed. The Obama administration has announced plans to split MMS into two agencies, one for oversight and one for permits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> While the Senate hearing was unfolding in Washington, the coastguard and the MMS held their own hearing outside New Orleans to look at the developing theories as to what went wrong. At the time of the blowout the Deepwater Horizon&#8217;s crew was sealing the well before moving off to another site. As part of that process they had to replace the dense drilling mud, which was used to keep the well under pressure while it was drilled, with sea-water. The water would exert less pressure on the oil and gas down below, which is why it was important that concrete seals were in place to avoid any blowout.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Anthony Gervasio, an engineer on the supply ship into which the drilling mud was being pumped, testified that on the night of the disaster they had stopped work around dinnertime, after getting 3,100 barrels of mud stored away. Soon afterwards, presumably because a seal had failed, natural gas burst out of the well with a shower of mud, knocking birds from the sky. A geyser of gas and liquid erupted. The rig caught fire and later sank, claiming 11 lives. If the efforts to seal off the leak that was left behind do not succeed soon, the final tally of destruction, if not death, may rise quite quickly. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Tea-partiers dump another victim in the metaphorical harbour</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | LOS ANGELES | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHAT&#8217;S not to like about Senator Robert Bennett? The grandson of a Mormon leader and son of a senator, he is as much a part of Utah as the Great Salt Lake. His conservative Republican credentials would have seemed impeccable not long ago&#8212;he opposes abortion, likes a flat tax and voted against Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court. There were questions about his role in the Watergate scandal, but that was long ago, and Mr Bennett, 76, has spent three terms in the Senate without notable sleaze or incompetence. Other senators like him. So do politicians in Utah. Mitt Romney, still a star there, endorsed him for a fourth term. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And yet, in this unusual year, this was not enough for Utah&#8217;s Republicans. At their convention on May 8th they ejected Mr Bennett unceremoniously from participating in the Republican primary on June 22nd. Many of the 3,452 delegates, riled up by tea-party fervour, found his conservatism wanting and chose instead two relative unknowns, Tim Bridgewater, a businessman, and Mike Lee, a lawyer, to run against each other, on the assumption that they will both be ideologically pure. This makes Mr Bennett the first incumbent senator from Utah in seven decades to lose his party&#8217;s nomination. Suddenly, incumbents are trembling everywhere.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How did Utah&#8217;s Republicans decide that Mr Bennett had strayed from the true path? He voted for the Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP), part of the legislation (passed by the Bush administration) that was meant to prevent an economic depression and which the tea-party movement now calls &#8220;bail-outs&#8221;. Some delegates were heckling Mr Bennett with shouts of &#8220;TARP, TARP, TARP&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Others did not like Mr Bennett&#8217;s suspicious record of reaching across the aisle; he worked with a Democrat to draft an alternative plan to reform health care. Still others scorned his occasional success in winning federal favours for Utah, seeing this as proof that he is part of an earmark culture.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Whether Mr Bennett is a bellwether for other incumbents up for re-election remains to be seen. Utah&#8217;s nomination process is unusual in that relatively few party faithful, through a caucus system, have the power to pre-select candidates for the primaries, knowing that Republicans invariably win the general election. Had Mr Bennett faced all registered Republicans, he might have survived. Tea-party candidates in states with traditional primaries have not done well so far. But the movement now has high hopes for primaries such as Kentucky&#8217;s on May 18th, where Rand Paul, son of Ron, a libertarian presidential candidate, wants to stage another upset. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What seems certain is that this is an angry year. &#8220;The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic and it&#8217;s very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment,&#8221; Mr Bennett said, acknowledging his defeat with moist eyes. But he added that he would not have changed his votes even if he had known that they would cost him his job. That attitude used to be the mark of not just an honourable but an electable senator. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The perils of being small</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>New data confirm that small firms are dragging on the job market</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVEN as they heap scorn on big business, Americans and their congressmen retain a place in their hearts for small business. Which is fortunate, since small business need a little sympathy these days. Their travails, however, go some way towards explaining the puzzling weakness of job creation since the recession ended last year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The contribution made by small businesses to overall job creation is often exaggerated. They do indeed account for most new jobs, but they also account for most job losses. Unfortunately, reliable data that tracks their net employment performance is scarce. The Treasury Department has now helpfully addressed this shortcoming by culling hiring-and-firing data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics by size of establishment. It shows that since the recession began in December 2007, firms with fewer than 50 employees have shed jobs at a rate of 0.4% per month, compared to just 0.2% both at firms with 50 to 249 employees and at larger firms (see chart).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More striking is the divergence since the recession ended, roughly around last June. Since then large firms have added, on average, a net 32,000 or so jobs each month. Medium-sized firms continued to contract, though at a barely perceptible rate. But small firms, which account for about 41% of total employment, continued to lose a withering 158,000 jobs per month.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Alan Krueger, a Princeton University labour economist now at the Treasury Department, has two theories for the divergence in employment between large and small firms: one is that large firms have a lot of fixed costs invested in the training of their employees, and are more reluctant to lay them off. Such costs are lower for small firms. The other factor is the tightness of credit. Large firms have more cash and easier access to the capital markets. Small firms are more likely to have to rely on banks, which have tightened their lending standards. That may be why small firms have done relatively worse now than in the 2001 recession, when their payrolls shrank less than at large firms.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If Mr Krueger is right, loosening credit could be the key to restoring job growth at small firms. To help do this, the Treasury has proposed a $30 billion small-business loan fund financed from its much-criticised Troubled Asset Relief Programme (TARP). Banks would be able to draw capital from the fund and use it to make loans to small businesses at concessionary rates. Onerous restrictions on executive pay, not to mention public vilification, have made TARP capital deeply unpopular with banks, so the administration would waive these restrictions for the fund.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fund may, however, turn out to be unnecessary. In the past month there have been signs that things are starting to turn round. Commercial and industrial loans by banks shrank by 24% between October 2008 and March, but have levelled off since then, and Fed surveys have found that for the first time since 2007 banks are easing standards for business loans. The latest survey by the National Federation of Independent Business shows a modest uptick in members&#8217; optimism, although more of them still plan to cut employment than to increase it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The good news for small firms may also be showing up in the jobs data. Non-farm employment rose by 290,000, or 0.2%, in April, the largest one-month gain for four years. Temporary census workers accounted for a quarter of those, but private job creation was widespread. The unemployment rate rose to 9.9%, from 9.7%; this is actually a happy consequence of workers coming off the sidelines to hunt for jobs. Small businesses may at last be ready to hire some of them. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A plan is in the works to save New York&#8217;s Catholic schools</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | HARLEM | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FIVE single mothers with children at St Mark the Evangelist, a Catholic school in Harlem, lost their jobs recently. &#8220;These mothers are struggling to put food on the table and pay their rent,&#8221; says Sister Catherine Hagan, the principal. Although she told them not to worry about the fees, she is worried about the school&#8217;s own bills. Sister Catherine recently learned that her main donor is being forced to scale back the assistance it provides. She remembers a time when she didn&#8217;t have to think about money.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Since 1965 half of the country&#8217;s Catholic schools have shut their doors because of declining enrolment and strained finances. Since 2000 alone total enrolment has dropped by 20%. The 2009-10 school year saw 174 schools closing or consolidating. Holy Trinity in Hawaii will close in June, for instance. Baltimore will close 13 of its 64 Catholic schools. Nor is New York immune. St Patrick&#8217;s Old Cathedral School, the city&#8217;s most venerable Catholic school, is only the latest to be scheduled for closure.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Timothy Dolan, New York&#8217;s archbishop, refuses to join in the general gloom. He is working on a strategic initiative to save the Catholic schools in his archdiocese. It involves co-operating closely with Catholic universities. School governance, traditionally in the hands of parishes, will be re-examined. There may, it is true, be fewer schools, but not fewer students. His plan will take into account financing, demographics and geography. Empty buildings will be leased or sold with the revenues going to support other schools.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The University of Notre Dame has chosen New York for a pilot programme to increase Latino enrolment. Only 3% of Latino children go to Catholic schools, yet Latinos who do attend them are 42% more likely to graduate from high school and two-and-a-half times more likely to graduate from college. More than 93% of Catholic elementary schools offer those that need it some help with the fees, but for many Latino families, even then the fees are too high. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Overwhelmed by its burdens, the Washington, DC, archdiocese converted seven of its schools to charter status in 2008. This means that the taxpayer picks up the bill and students pay nothing, but that the school can no longer operate as a religious establishment. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Could this work in New York? Archbishop Dolan rules it out, as he believes the Catholic element is what makes his schools succeed. Unfortunately for the Catholic schools, charters have adopted many of the same practices, including uniforms, discipline and the promotion of a clear set of values. That means that they have started to attract the pupils who might have gone to Catholic schools. &#8220;They are killing us,&#8221; says Sister Catherine. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>In praise of Boise</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Why space really is the final frontier in the internet age</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>MOUNTAIN bikes hang from a rack in the offices of Balihoo, a software firm in Boise, Idaho. Many Balihoo staff cycle to work, including the boss, Pete Gombert. Asked why he moved to Boise, Mr Gombert raves about the quality of life. The sun shines for 300 days a year. Crime is as rare as the colossal steaks. And the great outdoors is only a few blocks away. Mr Gombert loves to fish, hike and ski. Also, since both of his children have taken up golf, he selflessly plays with them at weekends. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is a lot of space in Boise. A 25-mile green belt runs through the city. The nearby foothills are latticed with biking trails. At 3,000 people per square mile, the population density is less than a twentieth of Manhattan&#8217;s. Yet although Boise is remote&#8212;the nearest big city is 340 miles away&#8212;it is no backwater. Since 1978 it has been home to Micron, a large semiconductor firm. (The local potato billionaire was an early investor, leading to inevitable jokes about the shift from chips to microchips.) A cluster of high-tech start-ups has appeared. Surprisingly, between 2005 and 2007 Idaho generated more patents per worker than any other state. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Brain workers like to live near each other. It is easier to keep up with the latest ideas if you keep bumping into other people who work in the same field. As Alfred Marshall, an English economist, wrote in 1890: in industrial clusters &#8220;the mysteries of the trade become no mystery, but are, as it were, in the air.&#8221; That is why geeks flock to Silicon Valley and financiers converge on New York. But such clusters can become victims of their own success. When a hotspot gets too hot, it becomes expensive to live there, which spurs some brainy people&#8212;especially those with children&#8212;to migrate to places that are not quite so hot but more liveable. The population of the Boise-Nampa metro area has nearly doubled in the past two decades, sparking a property bubble. Yet housing is still laughably cheap: $150,000 buys you a spacious house with a garden. In the nice parts of Palo Alto, it buys you a poky flat. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The internet lets people compare cities and neighbourhoods by whatever criteria matter to them, from house prices to commuting times. That gives a boost to remote but agreeable locales. Also thanks to the internet, people can now live far from the madding crowd and yet remain abreast of its ignoble strife. &#8220;What Karl Marx called &#8216;the idiocy of rural life&#8217; no longer applies,&#8221; writes Joel Kotkin, a demographer, in a book called &#8220;The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050&#8221;. A brain worker in Boise has the same access to technical and market information as her rival in San Francisco. In her leisure time, she can download the same books and films. She may not have the same choice of avant-garde theatre, but that is a sacrifice she may be content to make.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>America&#8217;s hinterland is often mocked. Cosmopolitans dismiss it as &#8220;flyover country&#8221;. Many assume that nothing interesting happens there. Yet as America&#8217;s population expands, much of the growth will occur where there is space. Mr Kotkin predicts a resurgence of the heartland, as Americans move away from the coasts in search of more room. The same forces will attract immigrants to places that have traditionally been lily-white. The Boise metro area already has a population that is 17% ethnic minority, mostly Hispanic or Asian. Restaurants serve Japanese cuisine with an Idaho twist: huge portions. &#8220;Life is easy here,&#8221; says Jinye Huo, a software engineer at Balihoo, whose home in Boise is four times larger than her old flat in Beijing. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Others are less bullish about America&#8217;s wide open spaces. Many greens would prefer it if everyone lived in tiny energy-efficient urban apartments. Some go further. Deborah and Frank Popper, two academics from the north-east, once proposed emptying much of the Great Plains and creating a national park for buffalo. More pragmatically, Edward Glaeser of Harvard University argues that improvements in transport and communications technology will make &#8220;idea-producing&#8221; cities even denser. When new ideas can easily be sold around the world, he argues, the rewards for generating them rise, and brainy people will be lured to Boston and New York with ever-fatter pay packets. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Different strokes</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Both Mr Kotkin and Mr Glaeser could be right. Some of the next 100m Americans will choose to live in towering mega-cities. Others will crave backyards big enough to play softball in. Who lives where will depend on public policy (zoning rules, petrol taxes, etc), on natural constraints (water, energy) and on individual tastes. But however birth rates and migration patterns change, America&#8217;s geographical size will be a huge advantage. It means that Americans can keep reproducing and welcoming immigrants without their country ever feeling crowded. If the population doubled, it would still be only a quarter as crowded as Britain is today, and less than a hundredth as crowded as Singapore. Vast swathes of land are almost empty. David Bieter, the mayor of Boise, says his city could easily double in size again. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Wide open spaces and the struggle to settle them are the keys to American culture, argued Frederick Jackson Turner, a historian, a century ago. The practical skills and rugged individualism of the frontiersfolk made the country prosperous, decentralised and democratic. Turner overstated his case, but America is far more decentralised than other rich countries. In Britain &#8220;there&#8217;s London, London and London,&#8221; says Mr Kotkin. In America there are scores of hubs. There is also a libertarian streak in America&#8217;s most sparsely-populated states. Only 10% of Idahoans trust the federal government, says Greg Hill, a professor at Boise State University. Butch Otter, the state&#8217;s governor, rebelled against both Obamacare and George Bush&#8217;s Patriot Act. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tread on me&#8221; was one of the first slogans of the American revolutionaries; and in the open spaces, no one needs to tread on anyone else. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Lame ducks no longer</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Written off just months ago, the Kirchners are bouncing back. But if a divided opposition is outwitted at the next election it will have only itself to blame</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BUENOS AIRES | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PUNDITS began writing Cristina Fern\xE1ndez&#8217;s political obituary just eight months after she became Argentina&#8217;s president in 2007. She squandered the popularity she had inherited from her husband and predecessor, N\xE9stor Kirchner, by picking and losing an ill-advised fight with farmers over export taxes. Then the world financial crisis abruptly halted the country&#8217;s economic boom, even as inflation eroded workers&#8217; purchasing power. After years of unquestioned authority, the Kirchners suffered an embarrassing defeat in a midterm election last June. Not only did their Peronist party lose its congressional majority, but its list of candidates in Buenos Aires province&#8212;home to almost two-fifths of the electorate&#8212;led by Mr Kirchner himself, finished second. He promptly submitted his &#8220;irrevocable&#8221; resignation as party leader.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first couple have done little to merit a comeback since then. Nonetheless, thanks to a recovering world economy, the advantages of incumbency and a hapless opposition, they are showing surprising resilience. Ms Fern\xE1ndez&#8217;s approval rating has increased from 20% to 29% over the past seven months. Francisco de Narv\xE1ez, who beat Mr Kirchner in Buenos Aires province in last year&#8217;s election, reckons they have a 50-50 chance of winning the 2011 presidential election. Mr Kirchner, who has taken back control of the Peronists, says he and his followers are &#8220;determined to continue governing until 2020.&#8221; Unlike Hugo Ch\xE1vez, their Venezuelan ally, the Kirchners would not have to overturn term limits to do so, since they could continue to take turns in power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fortunes of Argentina&#8217;s leaders have often been tied to global demand for the country&#8217;s farm exports. The Kirchners are no exception. Although the price of soyabeans, the most important crop, has fallen by 40% from its peak in July 2008, it is still 60% above its historical average. Moreover, after the pampas suffered a severe drought last year, they are now enjoying a bumper harvest. The government collects 35% of these revenues.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ms Fern\xE1ndez has further lined the public purse by nationalising the country&#8217;s pensions and raiding its foreign-currency reserves. When the Central Bank&#8217;s president, Mart\xEDn Redrado, opposed her plan to use $6.6 billion of reserves to repay debt (which would free other revenues for new spending), she forced him to resign. Congress subsequently approved the policy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Armed with these funds, the president is trying to buy back estranged voters&#8217; affection. In October she extended the child-support system for poor families, at a cost of $2.6 billion a year. The government is also wooing younger voters with plans to distribute 250,000 laptops to secondary-school students and provide 15,000-20,000 cheap mortgages, many of which will go to first-time buyers. In addition to their direct benefits, these initiatives have helped kick-start the economy, which should grow by more than 5% this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ms Fern\xE1ndez is also benefiting from the way in which her husband boosted the power of the presidency. He reduced the share of taxes that is automatically transferred to the provinces, making their governors more dependent on the central government for financing. Many legislators are beholden to the governors. By artfully increasing public spending to its allies among them and withholding it from foes, the government has retained much of its sway over Congress despite lacking a majority. It has also got bills approved by cleverly exploiting the opposition&#8217;s divisions and picking off factions within it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Finally, although the economic costs of Argentina&#8217;s 2001 debt default have mostly been left behind, its political consequences continue to favour the Peronists. The Radicals, their traditional rivals, had the misfortune to be in office during the crash, and voters have never forgiven them. Their implosion is a big reason for the opposition&#8217;s fragmentation. Many presidential hopefuls from the opposition have less in common with each other than with the Kirchners. Perhaps the strongest contender is Mr de Narv\xE1ez, a businessman and dissident Peronist. But since he was born in Colombia, his candidacy depends on the Supreme Court reinterpreting a constitutional bar on foreigners.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As neighbours such as Brazil and Chile forge ahead, the average Argentine has plenty to grumble about. One in three is still poor and inflation is heading for 30%, although the government rigs the figures at a third of that. But the Kirchners will not bury themselves. To dethrone them the opposition will have to move beyond knowing whom they are against and decide whom and what they are for.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Plus \xE7a change</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>But the balance of diplomatic power shifts to Brazil</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AT THE first summit between the European Union and Latin America in 1999, the assembled leaders announced a &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; with no fewer than 55 &#8220;priorities&#8221; from human rights to tourism. Over objections from France, which was worried about its farmers, they agreed to launch talks on freer trade between the EU and Mercosur, a sub-regional group based on Brazil and Argentina, provided these moved in parallel with what became the Doha round of world-trade talks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Not much of this has happened. The following four summits were notable chiefly for demonstrating Latin America&#8217;s recent disunity: Argentina and Uruguay were not on speaking terms at one, while Cuba&#8217;s Fidel Castro and Venezuela&#8217;s Hugo Ch\xE1vez sounded off against free trade and European preaching on human rights. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Spain, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, wants to use this year&#8217;s get-together, in Madrid on May 18th, to &#8220;relaunch&#8221; the relationship. Its hopes are pinned on trade deals (technically, an &#8220;association agreement&#8221;) with Colombia and Peru and with Central America, and on restarting the talks with Mercosur, which have been suspended since 2004. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The only certainty is the signing of the pact with Colombia and Peru, which then must be approved by the European Parliament. Despite concerns about human-rights abuses in those countries, the parliamentarians will probably decide that in boosting trade and investment the agreement would bolster democracy. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The negotiations with Central America were dogged at first by a dispute over Europe&#8217;s barriers to their exports of bananas. This was eventually resolved last year, but a coup in Honduras caused the talks to be frozen until February. Several issues remain: for example, Central America wants to limit imports of Europe&#8217;s (subsidised) powdered milk and cheese. European diplomats hope to address these concerns in a last round of dialogue before the summit.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>With the Doha round dead, Mercosur will agree to Europe&#8217;s request for exploratory talks about renewing their negotiations. But since France is opposed, and Argentina often breaks Mercosur&#8217;s rules, these are unlikely to get anywhere.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Back in 1999, Europe was confidently expanding and Latin America was in recession. Now the reverse is true. Although Europe is still Latin America&#8217;s biggest aid donor and foreign investor, its trade with the region has grown much more slowly than China&#8217;s over the past decade. Moreover, the global balance of power is starting to shift to countries like Brazil.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Ahead of a presidential election in October, Brazil has lurched to the left in foreign policy. It threw its weight around before the summit. Brazil and its South American allies refuse to recognise Porfirio Lobo, Honduras&#8217;s president, because he was elected under a government that took power through a coup. They threatened to boycott the event if Mr Lobo attended. Mr Lobo obligingly agreed to turn up only for a separate meeting between the EU and Central America. This ostracism is bizarre given that Mr Lobo won a reasonably free election in November. The same cannot be said for the governments in Iran, which Brazil&#8217;s president, Luiz In\xE1cio Lula da Silva, will visit before arriving in Madrid, or in Cuba, with which he is friendly.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Marginally useful as the trade deals may be, they hardly add up to a &#8220;strategic association&#8221; between the two continents. This will remain a distant prospect as long as Latin America is divided and Europe is preoccupied with its own woes.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p>FEW Latin American presidents would seem less likely to confront a guerrilla uprising than Paraguay&#8217;s Fernando Lugo. A former Catholic bishop, Mr Lugo rose to prominence as a liberation theologian and advocate for land reform. His election in 2008 broke the Colorado Party&#8217;s 61-year hold on power, cementing the country&#8217;s shift to democracy. Yet after a series of provocative attacks by the tiny Paraguayan People&#8217;s Army (EPP), Mr Lugo is now in a similar position to the region&#8217;s right-wing leaders of yesteryear.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Founded in 2001, the EPP is thought to have a mere 20 armed members, and has been behind only a few crimes. But these have been shocking: in 2004 it kidnapped and murdered Cecilia Cubas, the daughter of a former president. Officials say it has ties to Colombia&#8217;s FARC. It is reportedly sheltered by peasant groups, drug traffickers and corrupt police.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The EPP has been a big headache for Mr Lugo. Last year the group kidnapped Fidel Zavala, a well-known rancher, for 94 days, and released him only once a ransom was paid. In April an EPP member killed a police officer and three ranch workers. The opposition has criticised the president for being soft on the guerrillas, claiming that he once knew some of their leaders through the church.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In response to these attacks, the president asked Congress to grant him emergency powers, which it did on April 24th. The law, valid in five departments for 30 days, authorises arrests without a warrant and allows the army to join the police in security operations. Mr Lugo promptly sent 1,000 extra troops to the region, bringing the total to 3,000.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The crackdown has had mixed results so far. The government boasts of the capture of Jes\xFAs Ortiz, allegedly an EPP logistics co-ordinator, on May 6th. However, he was arrested outside the area subject to the measures. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, the military deployment has been a fiasco. One group of soldiers accidentally started a firefight with police officers by raiding their headquarters. Another angered residents by barging in on a girl&#8217;s 15th-birthday party. Human-rights groups say they have received reports that the army is extracting fake fines from civilians and making arrests unrelated to the EPP.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite these setbacks, Mr Lugo wants Congress to make permanent the provision allowing the army to accompany police. For now, the fight remains popular, both with wealthy farmers and with peasants who fear the guerrillas&#8217; wrath. But public opinion may sour if the government fails to eliminate the EPP. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To do so it will have to strengthen the state&#8217;s presence in the countryside, improve co-ordination between the police and the army and modernise the courts. Diego Zavala, Fidel Zavala&#8217;s brother, says he has not testified against the group because Paraguay lacks a witness-protection programme. &#8220;My family and I are constantly threatened by the EPP,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and we live in fear.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Some mother's son</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The Aquino family has a second shot at running South-East Asia&#8217;s laggard</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | MANILA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOLLOWING in the footsteps of his mother, Corazon Aquino, Benigno &#8220;Noynoy&#8221; Aquino (above), an opposition senator, is poised to become the Philippines&#8217; next president. He has built up a seemingly unassailable lead in tallies of votes cast in a tense election held on May 10th. As when his mother took power from the dictator Ferdinand Marcos in 1986, his supporters pray that this marks a new era full of the promise of clean, stable politics and economic prosperity. They also pray that, this time, the promise will be fulfilled.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An unofficial tally showed that with nearly nine-tenths of the vote counted, there was little chance Mr Aquino could be overtaken by his nearest rival, a former president, Joseph Estrada, who has yet to concede victory. Congress is due to reconvene on May 31st to proclaim the winner.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In electing Mr Aquino, voters used a new computerised vote-counting system almost as revolutionary, by Philippine standards, as the &#8220;People Power&#8221; uprising that toppled Marcos. The system was meant to prevent the cheating that has marred previous elections, but there were doubts that it would work, and last-minute calls for the election to be postponed. Some members of the opposition suspected that the system was bound to fail and so allow the incumbent president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, to cling to power. In the event the system worked fine, though largely because Mr Aquino&#8217;s lead was so great as to be beyond dispute. There was a national sigh of relief: Mr Aquino had threatened another People Power uprising if he was cheated of victory.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There were the usual reports of vote-buying; in a few areas no voting took place at all; and the police said at least ten people were killed on polling day. Even so, the national police chief described the elections as &#8220;the most peaceful and orderly political exercise ever held in our land&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Aquino played on his reputation for honesty, contrasting himself with Mrs Arroyo, whose administration has been beset by corruption scandals. His campaign slogan was &#8220;No corruption means no poverty&#8221;. He has said he will have Mrs Arroyo investigated for graft. But what has been publicly disclosed about Mr Aquino&#8217;s policies is long on pious wishes and short on detail. His reputation is largely inherited from his mother, revered for her probity. Her death last year provoked an outpouring of grief and a clamour for her son to run for president, despite his relative obscurity. He has served in both houses of Congress, but has a lacklustre record there.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Aquino will face problems familiar to his predecessors: how to spur an economy that lags behind most of South-East Asia; widespread, entrenched poverty; a high birth-rate; reform of an over-prescriptive constitution; communist and Muslim separatist insurgencies; and home-grown terrorism linked to al-Qaeda.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He will need the co-operation of a new congress, also elected on May 10th. It was not immediately clear how well Mr Aquino&#8217;s Liberal Party and its allies had fared. But parties often count for little&#8212;for the most part congressmen align themselves with the main source of political patronage, ie, the president. This kind of political opportunism and the tradition that new presidents return the favours done by power brokers during their election campaigns mean Mr Aquino will need all his mother&#8217;s fortitude to resist the blandishments of those around him.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another misgiving about the incoming president is that, like Mrs Arroyo (the daughter of an ex-president), he comes from one of the handful of families that have dominated Philippine politics and the economy for generations. His mother is remembered for restoring democracy But she failed to entrench stability or prosperity. During her presidency the economy boomed but then sagged, and she had to fend off several military-coup attempts. And she allowed the dominant families to regain the political and economic clout usurped by Marcos and his cronies. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In trying to make the second Aquino presidency more successful than the first, Mr Aquino will face opposition. On election day Mrs Arroyo won a seat in Congress. Her party, still a force to be reckoned with, aims to make her speaker. And although the incoming president says there is no more rancour between him and the Marcos family, the dictator&#8217;s widow, Imelda, has also been elected to the house. She will be a well-shod reminder that Mrs Aquino failed to have her put behind bars for the fabulous corruption of which she and her late husband were accused. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Thaksin's harvest</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Where red shirts hang their hats</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BAN HAET | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN A village in Thailand&#8217;s north-east stands a communal rice-thresher in a padlocked cage. It is a little rusty, but will be humming again when the harvest comes. Village elders praise the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. All are ardent supporters of the red-shirt rallies, now into their third month in Bangkok. The thresher helps explain why. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It was bought with government funds, part of the largesse showered on rural voters during Mr Thaksin&#8217;s five-year rule. Before it arrived, farmers had to pay private millers. A 1m-baht ($30,000) village-run microcredit scheme was also popular. Crop prices stayed high with government support. All in all, farmers did grandly under Mr Thaksin, declares Uthai Khunthabutra, a retired schoolteacher. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Much of this generosity has continued under today&#8217;s prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva. His coalition government has added its own giveaways such as guaranteed pensions. But Mr Abhisit has not won any friends in Ban Haet. His populism is dismissed as a pale imitation of Mr Thaksin&#8217;s dynamic ideas. Why bother with second-best, sneers Yongyuth Patimakorn, another red-shirt activist. &#8220;Thaksin thinks tonight and acts tomorrow,&#8221; he says. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So do the red shirts, though not all its factions think alike, to the frustration of negotiators. Some protesters do not care if Mr Thaksin, who lost power in a 2006 coup, is rehabilitated. But he is still a draw for rural protesters who have poured into Bangkok in droves, even after their leaders welcomed Mr Abhisit&#8217;s May 3rd peace plan. The plan envisaged elections in November, an offer that is now in jeopardy. It called for press freedom, an investigation into deadly April 10th clashes and an end to dragging the monarchy into the crisis (of which all sides are guilty).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the red-shirt heartland a delayed election smacks of defeat. So organisers have been mustering more protesters. Parents in Bangkok fret that schools around the protest site will not be able to reopen after a hot-season break. In the countryside another calendar counts. The rice fields will need planting soon. Farm labour will be in demand. That means fewer recruits for the Bangkok rally, where conditions are worsening, as the government threatens to cut off water and electricity. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thailand&#8217;s political crisis is often framed, simplistically, as a battle between haves and have-nots. But in Mr Uthai&#8217;s village, there are plenty of pickup trucks and tidy houses. The question is who speaks for his generation&#8217;s children, who are moving to provincial cities, eager to trade up. They have middle-class aspirations but their economic interests, and the politicians they elect, are not those of white-collar Bangkok. Mr Thaksin won their hearts by swelling their wallets. A global boom helped polish his pitch. Mr Abhisit took power in a nasty recession. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nobody expects his Democrat party to win in the north-east, which has backed Mr Thaksin or his proxies in four elections since 2001. Mr Abhisit hoped breakaway parties formed from the remnants of Mr Thaksin&#8217;s former machine would win seats for his coalition. That appears hopeless. Local politicians who switched to the government side are quietly courting the red shirts again. Mr Abhisit&#8217;s coalition will probably be big electoral spenders. But it won&#8217;t help, vows Mr Uthai. Villagers will simply take their money and vote for Mr Thaksin&#8217;s opposition. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Sodomy, the sequel</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Another tawdry court case for Anwar</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | KUALA LUMPUR | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PUTTING an opposition leader on trial inevitably carries a whiff of politics. When that leader is Anwar Ibrahim, and the charge is sodomy, the same accusation used in 1998 to wreck his political career and confine him to jail for six years, the whiff becomes a stink. Mr Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, is playing a familiar role in &#8220;Sodomy II&#8221;, as the newest case is known. He is in the dock again, but in the court of public opinion it is Malaysia&#8217;s judiciary and its political masters who face the judgment of a sceptical nation. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 10th the defence began its cross-examination of a former aide to Mr Anwar, Saiful Bukhari. In February he testified that Mr Anwar sodomised him in a borrowed flat on June 26th 2008. In Malaysia &#8220;carnal intercourse against the order of nature&#8221; is punishable by up to 20 years in prison, even between consenting adults. A conviction would automatically bar Mr Anwar from politics for five years and send his parliamentary coalition into disarray. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Saiful, now aged 25, is the prosecution&#8217;s star witness. Karpal Singh, the doughty chief defence lawyer and an opposition MP, began by asking about Mr Saiful&#8217;s acquaintance with the prime minister, Najib Razak. Mr Anwar&#8217;s team claims that a political conspiracy has been undertaken to discredit him. The government denies it strenuously. But the circumstances of Mr Saiful&#8217;s accusation remain murky. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Saiful has told the court that he went to visit Mr Najib, then deputy prime minister, at his house on June 24th 2008&#8212;two days before the alleged incident&#8212;to talk with him about his own troubles. That an ordinary citizen should have been granted such access has stoked suspicions. On the very same day, Mr Saiful went to see a police officer who played a key role in &#8220;Sodomy I&#8221;. Later, according to Mr Saiful&#8217;s testimony, he spoke by phone with Malaysia&#8217;s senior cop. How did he get the number? asked Mr Singh. Overheard it from Mr Najib, came the rather feeble reply. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other questions touched on the findings of the doctors who examined Mr Saiful. Two days after the alleged molestation, they found no sign of penetration. Another doctor wrote that the witness had inserted a plastic object into his backside. &#8220;Nothing wrong with your anus. Why all this fuss?&#8221; asked Mr Singh, crossly. Challenged over the medical reports, Mr Saiful protested that he could not see his own anus. The judge concurred. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Malaysians have grown used to such smut in the courtroom. Mr Anwar&#8217;s first trial featured a crusty mattress that the prosecution said was stained with his semen, proof of sodomy. Mr Anwar was released in 2004 only after it was ruled that testimony against him had been coerced. Four years later, as Mr Anwar prepared to stand for office again, with hopes of toppling a shaky government, Mr Saiful joined his campaign as a volunteer. Whatever the merits of his complaint, it is hard not to suspect a political hand at work. Mr Singh seems determined to reveal whose. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The trial has proved a distraction for Mr Anwar. His party has suffered a string of defections and lost a recent by-election. Another by-election looms in the important state of Sarawak on May 16th. The trial has forced Mr Anwar to cut short his campaigning. He has managed to keep up his foreign jaunts though, staying on the international stage, and chiding Mr Najib&#8217;s government for having hired an American lobbying firm to raise Malaysia&#8217;s profile. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In 1998, when Mr Anwar was first taken down, his supporters thronged the streets. Reactions this time have been more muted. Foreign governments took a dim view of Sodomy I; America&#8217;s vice president at the time, Al Gore, said it &#8220;mocked international standards of justice&#8221;. Twelve years ago Malaysia was teetering on the brink of financial ruin, and nervous foreign investors looked to Mr Anwar as a safer pair of hands. Fearing a power grab, the prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, sacked his uppity deputy and imposed capital controls. This time Malaysia&#8217;s finances are in fairly good shape and it is the rich world that is fretting over deficits. It may find less to say about Sodomy II.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>In ruddy health</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A rare rich-world leader for whom a budget brings good news</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | CANBERRA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE week began disastrously for Kevin Rudd, Australia&#8217;s prime minister. An opinion poll showed a dramatic slump in his approval rating. His chances of leading the Labor government to victory at an election due later this year looked on a knife-edge. Then came the good news.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Australia&#8217;s economy had already stood out from other rich countries&#8217; by surviving the global downturn without recession. As Wayne Swan, the treasurer, presented the budget for 2010-11 on May 11th, it seemed even more robust. A deficit of almost A$41 billion ($37 billion) is projected to become a surplus in 2012-13, three years earlier than first forecast. And the debt the government piled up to keep Australia afloat through the slump is also due to be paid off three years ahead of schedule, after peaking at 6.1% of GDP, a fraction of the percentage in the big rich countries in the G7 (see chart). &#8220;Rudd in free fall&#8221; headlines have disappeared, at least for now.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Australians, claims Mr Swan, &#8220;have defied global economic gravity.&#8221; In the 12 months up to June 2010, the economy is expected to have grown by 2%; it is forecast to grow 3.25% next year and 4% in 2011-12. Unemployment has been falling steadily from its peak last year of 5.8%. The recovery has been humming so strongly that the central bank started raising interest rates in October, and has done so five times since. While people in most rich countries fret, a poll by the Lowy Institute, a think tank, found 86% of Australians optimistic about the country&#8217;s economic performance over the next five years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Canberra&#8217;s financial mandarins attribute Australia&#8217;s resilience partly to the government&#8217;s well-directed fiscal stimulus, and to tight regulations that kept bank lending fairly conservative. But resource-rich Australia also enjoyed the sort of luck that has seen it weather other crises. Mr Swan says that, thanks to China&#8217;s own stimulus last year, Australia&#8217;s exports of iron ore and coal to its steel factories exceeded the government&#8217;s hopes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The extra revenue will go more to repaying debt than on election-year splurges. Instead, the government plans to finance several reforms with two new taxes. In April it raised tobacco excise by 25% to help pay for its grand plan for the federal government to take over most of the financing of Australia&#8217;s health system from the states. The second tax is more controversial. Spurred by a report by Ken Henry, head of the Treasury, the government wants to put a &#8220;resource super-profits tax&#8221; of 40% on the profits of mining companies. It will also cut company taxes overall. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The mining companies are gearing up for a campaign accusing the government of killing Australia&#8217;s golden goose. Citing uncertainty about the tax, Xstrata, a Swiss-based company, has suspended further exploration in Queensland, where it mines copper. After investing $38 billion since 2000, Rio Tinto, one of Australia&#8217;s biggest miners, is now reviewing new projects. The campaign seems to be resonating: this week&#8217;s poll showed more Australians opposed the tax than supported it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government argues that Australians are not getting their just rewards for the vast mineral reserves they own under their dirt. In the year to April, spot prices for iron ore and coal (among Australia&#8217;s biggest exports) rose by 190% and 70% respectively. Yet a system of royalties based largely on the volumes mined&#8212;which the new tax would replace&#8212;has not kept pace with the miners&#8217; soaring profits. The actual charge to mining companies has fallen by more than half, from about 34% of profits earlier this decade to less than 14% in 2008-09.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Rudd has little political capital to spare on a fight over mining. His opinion-poll rating has plunged by 14 percentage points in less than a month. More voters now disapprove of him than approve of him. The main cause for the slide seems to be his shelving of plans for an emissions-trading scheme to fight climate change, seen as one of his administration&#8217;s main goals. This will save the government A$652 million over five years (although the same amount will be invested in renewable energy). The budget, though, discloses an even bigger climbdown: instead of being delayed until 2013, the emissions scheme will now happen &#8220;only&#8230;if there is sufficient international action&#8221;. At least Mr Rudd can boast that he has been faithful to another important manifesto commitment: he won power in 2007 claiming to be a &#8220;fiscal conservative&#8221;. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Lone madmen without guns</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A pattern of senseless slaughter</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BEIJING | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ALL month schools in China have been on what the state-controlled press calls a &#8220;red alert&#8221; for possible attacks on pupils by intruders. In one city police have orders to shoot perpetrators on sight. Yet a spate of mass killings and injuries by knife or hammer-wielding assailants has continued. To the government&#8217;s consternation, some Chinese have been wondering aloud whether the country&#8217;s repressive politics might be at least partly to blame. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the latest reported incident, on May 12th, seven children were hacked to death at a rural kindergarten in the northern province of Shaanxi. Eleven other children were injured. It was one of half a dozen such cases at schools across China in less than two months. Three attacks occurred on successive days in late April, when more than 50 children were injured. The previous deadliest killed eight children in the southern province of Fujian on March 23rd. The killer was executed on April 28th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This has been embarrassing for a leadership fond of trumpeting its goal of a &#8220;harmonious society&#8221;. In 2004, two years after Hu Jintao became China&#8217;s leader, he and his colleagues called for better security at schools. But occasional attacks continued. Assailants were often said to be lone, deranged, men venting their frustrations on the weak. A report last year in the <em>Lancet</em>, a British medical journal, said that of 173m Chinese it estimated were suffering from mental illness, fewer than 10% had seen a mental-health professional. Knives are the weapons of choice in China, where firearms are hard to obtain. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over the May Day break, officials ordered yet another boosting of school security. The Communist Party&#8217;s law-and-order chief, Zhou Yongkang, called it an &#8220;urgent political task&#8221;. When classes resumed after the holiday, police patrols were stepped up near schools. Some hired security guards and equipped themselves with pepper spray, nets and pronged poles. In Beijing the authorities say that since the March 23rd attack they have prevented seven unspecified &#8220;incidents aimed at schools&#8221; with the arrest of ten suspects. On May 3rd police shot dead a man who took a child hostage in a residential area of the capital. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The recent violence has come at a bad time for the government, anxious as it is to project a positive image during the six-month World Expo in Shanghai, which began on May 1st. The authorities regard the expo as similar in importance to the Beijing Olympics of 2008. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Chinese press gave little prominence to the latest killings and largely stuck to reports from the official news agency, Xinhua. Their reticence could reflect fears of copycat crimes, or simply the old habit of burying news during big events. During the Olympics, one provincial propaganda department ordered that negative reports be &#8220;strictly controlled&#8221; and that there must above all be no reports on &#8220;problems that give the Western media a pretext for launching attacks, such as issues concerning press freedom, air quality, food safety, democracy, religion and legal issues&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But some online commentators in China have been less restrained. Han Han, one of the country&#8217;s most popular bloggers (and a huge irritant to the authorities), wrote that killing the weak was seen by the attackers as the most effective way of exacting revenge on a society &#8220;that has no way out&#8221;. He said that local governments should send the guards at official buildings to help protect schools, &#8220;because a government that can&#8217;t protect children doesn&#8217;t need so many people to protect itself.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even the official press has aired the odd hint of dissent. A newspaper in the central province of Henan said that while the West had many NGOs that could help people suffering from mental distress, in China there were very few. This, it said, led to problems becoming bottled up and eventually erupting in violence. But if more NGOs are what is needed to relieve China&#8217;s social tensions, the prospects now look bleak. One of the country&#8217;s most prominent NGO leaders, Wan Yanhai, has just fled to America to escape police harassment. His complaints are widely shared.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A nation's bouncers</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A suspicious death in police custody</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ABUBAKAR AWUDU SURAJ was already unconscious when the cabin crew of EgyptAir MS965 saw him on board, before the Tokyo-to-Cairo flight. Shortly later he was dead. A Ghanaian who had lived illegally in Japan, Mr Suraj was being deported on March 22nd, when he was lifted and forced onto the plane in handcuffs with a towel gagging him and knotted in the back to restrain him. An autopsy failed to determine a cause of death, yet his widow saw facial injuries when she identified the body. Three days later an Immigration Bureau official admitted: &#8220;It is a sorry thing that we have done.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The death is putting Japan&#8217;s controversial immigration policy under a sharper spotlight. The country has long eschewed immigration. In recent months, however, its resistance has become even tougher. Families have been broken apart as parents of children born in Japan have been detained and deported. People who seemed to qualify for a special residency permit (SRP), designed for those who overstay their visa but wish to remain, have been denied. Forced deportations have become more frequent and rougher, according to the Asian People&#8217;s Friendship Society, a Japanese immigrant-support group. Japan&#8217;s Immigration Control Centres, where many illegal residents are detained, have faced special criticism. This year alone, two detainees have committed suicide, one has publicly complained of abuse, and 70 inmates staged a hunger strike demanding better treatment. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Around 2m foreigners live legally in Japan, which has a population of 128m; the justice ministry counted 91,778 illegal residents as of January. But the number, boosted by cheap Chinese labourers, may well be much higher. After a nine-day research trip last month, Jorge Bustamante, the UN&#8217;s special rapporteur on migrants&#8217; rights, complained that legal and illegal migrants in Japan face &#8220;racism and discrimination, exploitation [and] a tendency by the judiciary and police to ignore their rights&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The SRP system is an example of the problem. No criteria for eligibility are specified. Instead, published &#8220;guidelines&#8221; are applied arbitrarily. And people cannot apply directly for an SRP: illegal residents can only request it once in detention, or turn themselves in and try their luck while deportation proceedings are under way. So most illegal residents just stay mum. Mr Suraj fell into the SRP abyss after he was arrested for overstaying his visa. Although he had lived in Japan for 22 years, was fluent in the language and married to a Japanese citizen, his SRP request was denied. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Why the tougher policy now? Koichi Kodama, an immigration lawyer assisting Mr Suraj&#8217;s widow, believes it is a reaction to the appointment last year as justice minister of Keiko Chiba, a pro-immigration reformer; the old guard is clamping down. The police are investigating the incident and the ten immigration officers in whose custody Mr Suraj died, though no charges have been brought. As for Mr Suraj&#8217;s widow, she has yet to receive details about her husband&#8217;s death or an official apology. The topic is one Japanese society would rather avoid. The press barely reported it. Still, when her name appeared online, she was fired from her job lest the incident sully her firm&#8217;s name. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Troubled transition</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The revolution was the easy part</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BISHKEK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>JUST one month after it took power, amid violent unrest, from Kurmanbek Bakiyev, an authoritarian and now exiled president, cracks are appearing in Kyrgyzstan&#8217;s interim government. A road map to democracy has been announced, with a referendum on a new constitution set for June 27th and presidential and parliamentary elections in October. That is a short time to build a new political order; but a long time for an interim government to last with no legal basis. And some of its members are already making no secret of their differing visions for the future.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is not surprising. The interim regime unites 14 opposition leaders from different parties, including past prime ministers, ministers and speakers of parliament. &#8220;To rule and govern all of them is quite a task,&#8221; says Roza Otunbayeva, head of the interim government and a former foreign minister and ambassador. She is glad of her experience in conflict resolution.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite the squabbling, the formal goalpost remains clear. The Kyrgyz people will be asked to approve a shift to a parliamentary republic, with the presidency reduced to a largely ceremonial role. The first draft of the new constitution promises free political and economic competition and a free media. It gives most power to the prime minister and strengthens political parties, which must pass a threshold of 5% of the national vote to win seats in parliament. But no one party can hold more than 50% of the seats plus two votes. This is to ensure that no single party can later change the constitution. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The draft may yet be subject to big changes, as many Kyrgyz citizens continue to submit proposals. A final version will be announced on May 20th. In the end, of a total of more than 100 registered political parties, around seven are expected to make it into parliament, says Omurbek Tekebayev, the acting deputy prime minister, who is in charge of constitutional reform.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is heated debate about whether the people of Kyrgyzstan are indeed ready for a parliamentary system as opposed to the presidential one with a strong leader they&#8212;like every other country in Central Asia&#8212;have had since independence in 1991. Two important members of the interim government, including the minister of defence, openly support a presidential republic as more fitting for the Kyrgyz character. Ms Otunbayeva, for her part, says Kyrgyzstan has suffered enough under a strong presidential system. Both Askar Akayev, the president overthrown in the &#8220;tulip&#8221; revolution of 2005, and his successor, Mr Bakiyev, became increasingly authoritarian and corrupt over time and brazenly promoted their own kin in politics and business.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Bakiyev retains some support, especially in the country&#8217;s south. On May 13th some of his supporters seized the regional government headquarters in the city of Osh. The uprising against Mr Bakiyev was bloody, leaving 86 dead and more than 1,600 injured. Flowers and photos of those killed have been stuck onto a fence surrounding the White House, the main government building in Bishkek. &#8220;We cannot let them have died in vain,&#8221; says Elmira Ibraimova of the interim government. The victims&#8217; relatives are calling for justice, and the interim government has unsuccessfully sought the extradition of Mr Bakiyev from Belarus, where he has found exile. But rumours have been circulating of large demonstrations&#8212;or even a counter-revolution&#8212;on May 17th, which marks the passing of 40 days since the killings.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Besides negotiating a brittle political transition, Kyrgyzstan, a poor country of some 5.4m people, faces an economic crisis. There are not enough jobs. National finances have long relied on remittances from migrant labourers, which last year came to about $1 billion, or 22% of GDP. An estimated 500,000 Kyrgyzstanis work in Russia and 50,000-100,000 in neighbouring Kazakhstan, depending on the season.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Making matters worse, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan closed their borders with Kyrgyzstan after the uprising last month. The Uzbek government does so periodically and in the past has even mined the border, but the closure of the crossing to Kazakhstan, allegedly to prevent the spread of weapons, has hit hard. Most food is imported. Since traders depend on supplies from Kazakhstan and a number of shops were looted, an estimated 100,000 people have lost their jobs since the uprising. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Senior officials attribute the border closures to fears in neighbouring authoritarian regimes of a contagious revolutionary &#8220;virus&#8221;. Seeing a true democracy develop next door might serve as an unhelpful example to their own opposition movements. Rather than risk instability in their own countries, they would prefer to destabilise Kyrgyzstan further.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;If they don&#8217;t open the border, we will export our revolution,&#8221; blusters Isa Omurkulov, the combative new mayor of Bishkek. But if the border stays closed for another month, it will spell economic disaster for Kyrgyzstan, and, perhaps, an explosion of anger just as dangerous to Kazakhstan as the virus of revolution. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The elusive fruits of inclusive growth</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The tricky search for forms of economic growth that will offer opportunity and protection for everyone</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SHINY Asia&#8217;s rapid economic growth over the past two decades, driven by cheap land and labour, technological change and the play of globalisation, has had a spectacularly improving effect on the lives of hundreds of millions. Since 1990 the number of those in extreme poverty, defined as earning less than $1 a day, has been halved, to under a fifth of developing Asia&#8217;s people. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far so miraculous. Yet the shiny face has a tarnished flip side. Poverty and the vulnerabilities associated with it remain entrenched. Further, inequalities are rising fast. The realisation is spurring a rethink among development experts. Until recently, economic growth and social policy were thought of separately. Inequalities and social exclusion, as Sarah Cook of the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development puts it, were viewed as a residual outcome of necessary market-led growth. The development response was to get markets right first and then deal with any remaining pockets of the poor. Persistent poverty and growing social exclusion call the approach into question.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China and Vietnam have seen huge improvements but in South Asia extreme poverty remains widespread. What is more, Ifzal Ali and Juzhong Zhuang of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) argue, when measured by a $2-a-day threshold, Asia&#8217;s performance in cutting poverty is less impressive, with about half of developing Asia remaining poor, and so susceptible to natural disasters, global economic turmoil and daily uncertainties.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Almost everywhere, success is inequitably shared. Measured by the Gini coefficient, income inequality has leapt in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and China. The few countries where inequality has not worsened, notably Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, were those worst hit by the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98&#8212;hardly a commendation.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Income inequality matters. For one, it entrenches discrimination in other areas, such as access to education and health care. Child mortality, school enrolment and the like have improved more slowly than have straight measures of poverty. Second, exclusion raises social and political tensions. The evidence lies not only with persistent armed conflicts, especially in South Asia. In China, President Hu Jintao&#8217;s call for a &#8220;harmonious society&#8221; recognises the risks from growing inequalities between regions, between cities and the surrounding countryside, and within cities.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet a seminar at the ADB&#8217;s annual meeting in Tashkent this month brought home how hard it is to agree on a common framework for ensuring &#8220;inclusive&#8221; growth and social protection. True, imaginative policy is multiplying. In 2001 the then prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, introduced universal health care, a radical move. Known as the 30-baht project after the co-payment patients had to make, it was too popular to scrap even after Mr Thaksin was ousted in a coup. Indeed, the co-payment has since been abolished. Since 2005 Indonesia has won praise for cash-transfer schemes directed at the country&#8217;s 19m poorest households at a time of rising food and fuel prices, followed by global turmoil. To pay for the scheme, the government slashed subsidies on fuel that, as ever, mainly benefited the rich.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most ambitious social-protection scheme is India&#8217;s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). Every rural household has the right to 100 days of work a year spent improving village infrastructure such as irrigation systems. In 2009 some 50m Indian households signed up, in places slowing migration patterns from poor to rich regions. The long-run benefits of such schemes, however, remain unclear. In the case of Indonesia, indicators for health and education remain dismal. As for the NREGA, even in the short-term demand for work outstrips supply and wages and benefits are often paid late or not at all. Ms Cook says that the scheme misses a trick by not building schools and redeveloping slums. And that the scheme was needed at all is a consequence of India&#8217;s abject failure to create enough jobs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This begs a closer look at the political roots of social exclusion. At the ADB meeting several angry Asians blamed, for the umpteenth time, the IMF&#8217;s harsh adjustment programmes following the Asian financial crisis. They might instead look closer to home. Commendably, China is attempting a dramatic expansion of health care and other social welfare, largely by imposing obligations on county governments. But in failing to provide portable benefits, the government excludes the country&#8217;s hundreds of millions of rural migrant workers, treated as second-class citizens in the cities which they have largely built.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Get your political house in order</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And it is one thing to build a new road, but quite another to put in place complex new systems providing social security. In China, with mounting inequalities and disparate interests that need accommodating, it is not clear that the country&#8217;s political system, top-heavy and authoritarian, is up to the task. Not that democracies have fared much better: witness India, Indonesia and the Philippines, where the presidential election this week underscored how power and wealth lie in the hands of a few families. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>They do, however, offer the poor a better chance of genuine electoral retribution; unlike, for example, most Central Asian countries. Until April&#8217;s coup in abject Kyrgyzstan, the ruling clan attempted to commandeer almost the entire state economy. And in Uzbekistan, the ADB&#8217;s host this month, the regime shows more interest in its own survival than in citizens&#8217; well-being: shadowy business groups control much of the economy, and Soviet-style agriculture is chiefly a tool of social control, to keep pesky people out of the cities. It all throws light on why development experts struggle to devise frameworks for social inclusion: they would not be in business if they took rulers to task over their unwholesome politics.</p>\r\n\

    <h1>Stop-gap or long-term leader?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The new head of state, Goodluck Jonathan (below), may have ambitions of his own</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | LAGOS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE streets of Ajegunle, a notoriously poor and crowded district of Lagos, barely deserve the description. Rusty yellow buses angrily navigate the craters and open sewers, sometimes ending up on their side in the dirt. This typifies the commercial capital of Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s second largest economy, illustrating the misuse of the country&#8217;s vast wealth since oil was struck over 50 years ago. When asked what issues most deserved the attention of Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria&#8217;s newly appointed president, a local said gloomily: &#8220;Just look outside.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Jonathan was sworn in on May 6th after six months of uncertainty and political gridlock. Umaru Yar&#8217;Adua, Nigeria&#8217;s long-ailing leader, had left in November for a clinic in Saudi Arabia, with scant explanation and without formally appointing a replacement, never to be seen in public again. Mr Jonathan, his vice-president, had been controversially installed as &#8220;acting president&#8221; in February, but all doubt as to who was in control was removed only when Mr Yar&#8217;Adua died on May 5th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even as acting president, Mr Jonathan presented himself as a much-needed reformer. Now properly in the chair, he has less than a year to live up to his word before elections due in the first half of 2011. But to do this, the once seemingly passive number two, who had previously been an innocuous state governor, must take on some powerful vested interests.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s giant, with an estimated 150m people, 250 ethnic groups and 36 billion barrels of oil, a reserve that is second in Africa only to Libya&#8217;s 44 billion. But corruption has consumed much of the oil money. Despite producing so much of the black stuff, Nigeria has to import almost all its petrol and generates enough electricity only to power a 100-watt light-bulb round the clock for just one in five of its people. The shacks of Ajegunle sometimes go for a fortnight with no electricity at all. Gross inequalities and a lack of jobs fuel outbreaks of violence across the country. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These problems are most egregious in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Gangs of militants, demanding a bigger share of oil revenue for themselves and their communities, have attacked oil facilities and kidnapped workers, dragging Nigeria&#8217;s production down from an average of more than 2.4m barrels a day in 2005 to around 1.8m last year. Mr Yar&#8217;Adua made some progress towards ending the violence by negotiating an amnesty last summer. Thousands of militants traded in guns for stipends and training. But the scheme is looking shaky after months of neglect. Few of the promised &#8220;jobs for the boys&#8221; have materialised. Some groups have called off ceasefires. Mr Jonathan, who comes from the Delta, has vowed to tackle these problems and implement the development schemes that Mr Yar&#8217;Adua started. Western oil firms in the area, such as Royal Dutch Shell and America&#8217;s Exxon Mobil, are watching as they ponder whether to invest anew.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even if Mr Jonathan&#8217;s plans work, they will take time. Perhaps his most achievable goal in the remainder of his current term is to clean up Nigeria&#8217;s flawed elections. His ruling People&#8217;s Democratic Party (PDP) has held power since the end of military rule a decade ago. Nigerians recalling the polls that brought Mr Yar&#8217;Adua to the presidency in 2007 speak of hired thugs stealing ballot boxes and party officials paying off voters for as little as N200 ($1.30) a go. &#8220;What we had in 2007 was not an election,&#8221; admits a party member. &#8220;The decisions had already been made and the results manufactured.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The new president has made a promising start by firing Maurice Iwu, the electoral commission&#8217;s widely discredited head. A bill on electoral reform is before parliament. The new laws could alter the present system, under which the president selects the commission&#8217;s head and controls his funds. Instead, the commissioners could be chosen independently. But two-thirds of the 36 states must approve such changes and the powerful state governors, many of whom benefit from the status quo, are said to be wary. Mr Jonathan will make enemies if he insists on ensuring a fairer and more competitive election next year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He may surprise everyone by running himself. That would break an unwritten PDP rule, whereby the presidency rotates between the mostly Muslim north and largely Christian south after every two terms. Mr Yar&#8217;Adua, a northern Muslim, died before his first term had ended.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But some powerful northerners are among Mr Jonathan&#8217;s allies and they may support his bid. Aliyu Gusau, his head of national security, a veteran of past military governments, is one. Younger northerners such as Nasir El-Rufai, a prominent former minister just back from self-imposed exile, have also expressed support for him. But they and others are also said to harbour presidential ambitions of their own.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Jonathan&#8217;s relations in the coming weeks with his vice-president, Namadi Sambo, a northern governor whom he appointed on May 13th, may signal his intent. At first it was assumed that the post would go to a northerner who would be groomed as next year&#8217;s presidential candidate. It is unclear yet whether Mr Sambo, who must be approved by parliament, will merely become the president&#8217;s running mate or whether the rotation rule will prevail.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;There are no rules in politics&#8212;just convenient arrangements&#8221;, says Thompson Ayodele at the Initiative for Public Policy Analysis, a Nigerian think-tank. If Mr Jonathan can make enough friends in the north and elsewhere, there is no constitutional reason why he should not run. But that might mean that, amid all the politicking, reforms could be put to one side. In that case, Mr Jonathan&#8217;s own ambition could stymie his commendable aims for the rest of this term of office. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Who profits most?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The money flows, but not only into South African pockets</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | JOHANNESBURG | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE football World Cup may give South Africa&#8217;s economy an astonishing extra 0.5% of growth, according to a recent report by Grant Thornton, a firm of accountants. That is quite a chunk of the country&#8217;s forecast 3% rate for the year. Some 373,000 foreigners are now expected during the tournament, which kicks off on June 11th. On average they will stay for 18 days, go to five matches and spend 30,200 rand (nearly $4,000) each. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Compelling figures for statistic mad football fans. But South Africa&#8217;s government is also taking them seriously because the same firm wrote a similar report on the cup&#8217;s impact on South Africa just before the world financial crash two years ago. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There were fears that the recession might shrink the economic benefits of the tournament to South Africa. In fact, if Grant Thornton is right, the country has little to worry about. In 2007 the firm expected 483,000 foreign visitors, so that number is sharply down. Moreover, only about 11,300 ticket-holders are from African countries outside South Africa, surely a disappointment to the organisers. But each visitor is now expected to make more of his (or less often her) trip, staying a bit longer and shelling out a third more cash. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> So the total effect on South Africa&#8217;s economy should be roughly the same, with about 93 billion rand ($12.4 billion) injected, most of that having been generated before this year. Tourism should account for 16% of the final total. Much of the rest will come from the central government&#8217;s spending on infrastructure.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Very nice for South Africa, perhaps. But South Africans themselves are grumbling about the eye-wateringly large amounts of money that FIFA, the world football body that is the monopoly organiser, is poised to make, even though South Africa is bearing most of the cost. FIFA is responsible only for the prize money paid to the teams along with the cost of their travel and preparation, which amounted to just $279m in Germany, where the tournament last took place, in 2006. This week FIFA said it would contribute an extra $100m to the South Africans to ensure that all the facilities are ready in time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the event&#8217;s main direct benefits, from television and marketing rights, all go to FIFA. According to Citi, the research arm of Citibank, FIFA&#8217;s profit in Germany came to $1.8 billion, equivalent to 0.7% of South Africa&#8217;s GDP. FIFA will recycle much of that money into football development worldwide. Nonetheless, even a bit of it would help clear up some of the country&#8217;s festering shanty towns. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p> OPERATION Flintlock has begun. American special forces have been descending on Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal in a joint exercise, expected to last another week or so, to combat Islamist terrorism in the region. It is the latest stage of an evolving partnership between America and much of west Africa. Over several years, Americans have been training their counterparts in these countries in everything from marksmanship and parachuting to the more touchy-feely stuff of winning over hearts and minds.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> When the Americans first started talking about al-Qaeda&#8217;s threat in the Sahara, many were sceptical. But a sharp increase in the rate of attacks in the past 18 months by what the jihadists call &#8220;al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb&#8221;, usually abbreviated to AQIM, have convinced even cynics that a threat of sorts does exist. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When AQIM emerged three years ago out of a ruthless Algerian guerrilla outfit called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, better known by its French abbreviation GSPC, it seemed intent on uniting north African jihadists to wage war on Europe. It has largely failed on that score, having been squeezed by Algeria&#8217;s security forces, who have broken up many of its cells. Instead, the group is now concentrating on softer targets in a belt of countries farther south.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Armies in the Sahel, that wide stretch of land just south of the Sahara, have increasingly often clashed with Islamist fighters. A handful of Westerners have been killed and a dozen of them who had been kidnapped in the region last year ended up in the hands of AQIM. It is not clear how many of those seizures were carried out by the group&#8217;s own fighters, thought to number a few hundred, rather than freelancers who passed them on. But ransom payments have certainly swelled AQIM&#8217;s coffers. Though payments are never officially confirmed, negotiators speak of millions of dollars changing hands to free captives. AQIM is still holding two Spaniards. Only one hostage, from Britain, whose government refuses to pay ransoms to terrorists, has been killed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Like other rebellious types in the region, such as the Tuaregs of Mali and Niger, AQIM&#8217;s fighters have long blurred the lines between Islamist militancy and organised crime. Kidnapping is a relatively new business and follows years of smuggling illicit goods across the Sahara to Europe. In recent years Latin American drug gangs have been funnelling a lot of cocaine through west Africa, making the trans-Saharan route far more lucrative. An American-led sting operation in Ghana and the discovery of a burnt-out Boeing aircraft in the desert in Mali have led to claims that AQIM has a big role in the drug trade. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Drug and security specialists say the Islamists are just one of several groups involved. But AQIM is plainly rattling several governments. It plays on local grievances. Its bountiful cash is a lure to young men living in poverty in the desert. The authorities of northern Nigeria are especially worried. The country was the original home of the young man with explosive underpants who tried to blow up an American airliner over Detroit at Christmas.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> An additional worry for Western governments is that the AQIM threat may have widened divisions within the region. Algeria is frustrated by the apparent inertia and alleged lack of backbone shown by some of its southern neighbours. Mali, for instance, was accused of feebleness when it freed some Islamists earlier this year in exchange for a French hostage. In the coming weeks the co-operation between American trainers and local security forces will be rigorously tested. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>An inevitably edgy start</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The two sides move crabwise as indirect negotiations begin</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | JERUSALEM | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE long-awaited &#8220;proximity talks&#8221; between Israel and the Palestinians have started, but if the American State Department had not publicly announced them, few people would have noticed. The American envoy, George Mitchell, has already been and gone after a first round but is expected back soon for another. In format, the new talks will be no different from the shuttling between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the Palestinians&#8217; headquarters on the West Bank, that the indefatigable Mr Mitchell has performed for more than a year, without much to show for it. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In substance, though, the new talks are now supposed to tackle the &#8220;core issues&#8221; dividing the two sides: defining new borders, dealing with the claimed right of Palestinians refugees to return, and how to persuade the Israelis to share Jerusalem. Putting those issues at the top of the agenda was a Palestinian condition for the talks&#8217; resumption. Israel, while rejecting &#8220;preconditions&#8221;, says the core issues can be broached but not seriously negotiated until direct face-to-face talks are held.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That raises the Palestinians&#8217; other precondition: a halt to Israel&#8217;s settlement-building on the West Bank. Saeb Erekat, the Palestinians&#8217; chief negotiator, pledged that there will be no direct talks unless the building stops completely, in East Jerusalem as well as the rest of the West Bank. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The State Department pointedly lauded Mr Netanyahu for his &#8220;statement that there will be no construction at the Ramat Shlomo project for two years&#8221;, a reference to a large Jewish suburb in East Jerusalem where new building was heralded by the Israelis just as America&#8217;s vice-president, Joe Biden, arrived in March to hail the resumption of talks&#8212;which then had to be aborted. Mr Netanyahu&#8217;s recent more emollient statement had, according to the Americans, &#8220;helped create an atmosphere that is conducive to successful talks&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If this was meant to embarrass Mr Netanyahu, it succeeded. He strenuously denied making any such statement. He had merely explained that the Ramot Shlomo project was not scheduled to begin for two years. Building would not, he insisted, be frozen anywhere in Jerusalem. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In their statement extolling the resumption, the Americans warned bluntly that &#8220;if either [side] takes significant actions during the proximity talks that we judge would seriously undermine trust, we will &#8230;hold them accountable.&#8221; This harks back to recent recrimination between America and Israel, mainly over settlements. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, who leads the Labour party in Israel&#8217;s ruling coalition, and was recently in Washington trying to heal relations, now says Mr Netanyahu must change his coalition if there is to be serious progress. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That would mean bringing in Kadima, a centrist party led by a former foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, who narrowly won Israel&#8217;s general election a year ago but failed to form a ruling coalition. She has balked in the past but has recently suggested she could work with Mr Netanyahu not just towards a peace deal but also to curb ultra-Orthodox encroachment on Israel&#8217;s largely secular lifestyle. For Mr Netanyahu that would mean dumping his coalition&#8217;s ultra-Orthodox parties, which he calls his &#8220;natural allies in the national camp&#8221;. Neither Ms Livni nor indeed Mr Mitchell is convinced yet that Mr Netanyahu wants to do so. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The real thing</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>An extreme movement that makes Hamas look mild by comparison</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | GAZA | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SMUGGLERS complain that Egypt hampers three things imported through the blockade-busting tunnels that supply Gaza: weapons, dishwashers (their timers can double as detonators), and books. Of the three, the last may be the most regulated. One smuggler complained that the Egyptian authorities confiscated a delivery of 10,000 books, the bulk of them a classical commentary on the Koran. In the eyes of the impounders, the people of Gaza, who are governed by the Islamists of Hamas, are quite Islamic enough already. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tunnel trouble is only one of the woes afflicting the book trade. The Hamas police are another. Gaza, a slither of land sandwiched between Egypt and Israel, has only three bookshops for its 1.5m people. Even these have empty shelves. In its drive for a monopoly over religious discourse, Hamas is forcing Islamists from other schools of thought to retreat to the web to publish their <em>samizdat </em>literature. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Of these the most prolific are the Salafists. <em>Salafi </em>literally means &#8220;disciple of the forebears&#8221; (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) but has come to refer to Muslim protestants who seek to slough off the corpus of Islamic tradition and return to the original purity of Islam&#8217;s early years. They particularly dislike the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Arab Islamist group, for making such 20th-century compromises as entering politics and campaigning in elections, a process they think usurps authority from God to man. They castigate Hamas, the Brothers&#8217; Palestinian branch, for taking part in the territory&#8217;s 2006 elections (which they won), for failing to apply the <em>sharia</em>, or Islamic law, and most recently for suspending the armed fight against Israel.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Salafists arrived in Gaza when Palestinian exiles returned from Saudi Arabia dressed in their garb of ankle-length tunics. Most preach absolute subservience to a legitimate leader, deemed to be the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, whose forces Hamas kicked out of Gaza in June 2007. Most of Gaza&#8217;s Salafist leaders are university professors, doctors and graduates, who see themselves as an elite, a cut above those they view as the unprincipled populists of Hamas. But they have attracted broader interest among Gazans opposed to Hamas, not least Mr Abbas&#8217;s Fatah faction, which once ruled the strip but has been hamstrung by Hamas. Fatah&#8217;s fans flock to Salafist mosques on Fridays in part to spare them from having to recite a weekly prayer for Gaza&#8217;s Hamas rulers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A few seek to revive the Salafist order by force. They declare the legitimate ruler to be not Mr Abbas but the global jihadist leadership. They dub Osama bin Laden their &#8220;righteous shepherd&#8221;. Some name their offspring after him. Many of them are barely literate, sprinkling their statements on the web with grammatical errors. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Their results have been patchy. Their most dramatic effort, a charge of three white horses with strap-on explosives last summer, ended when the cavalcade blew up before reaching its target, Israel&#8217;s border barricade. And though they profess to limit their <em>jihad </em>to the enemy outside, their most violent acts have been against other Gazans. To impose their Koranic writ they have bombed coffee shops, internet caf\xE9s and salons for women that employ male hairdressers. A spokesman for Jaish al-Umma (Army of the Muslim Community), the largest of the four armed Salafist groups, calls such acts &#8220;aberrations&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Palestinian authorities, Hamas and Fatah alike, have thumped them. Last August a Salafist leader publicly declared an emirate. In no time Hamas forces charged into his mosque in Rafah, a town on the border with Egypt, and killed him and 27 followers. Hundreds more were jailed. &#8220;In a democracy they would have been put on trial,&#8221; says Imad Falluji, a former leader of Hamas who abandoned it in the mid-1990s. &#8220;Under Hamas military rule they were simply tortured and executed.&#8221; </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most have since been freed, but only after renouncing their creed. A few hundred strong at most, they no longer strut the streets with their guns or blow up caf\xE9s but are lying low. After Hamas recently put up taxes, it was secular left-wingers, not Salafists, who protested most loudly. Salafists for now have lost the battle. But they have tarnished Hamas&#8217;s Islamist halo by daring to query it. Dissent in Gaza is rising.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Salafists&#8217; one source of succour could lie among malcontents within Hamas who were raised on a diet of ideological militancy but fear that their movement is selling out. Their most prominent member was Nizar Rayan, a university professor who taught the Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s life and times while doubling as head of Hamas&#8217;s military wing. But he was killed during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in January last year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His followers, however, remain. Sometimes they help Salafist prisoners of Hamas to get out of jail. They criticise Hamas for taxing such evils as cigarettes rather than banning them outright, as they do alcohol. And they wonder glumly what other ideological compromises the Hamas government may make in pursuit of power. If Hamas is booted out, Islamists could yet look to the Salafists as Gaza&#8217;s next force for renewal&#8212;and rejection of Israel. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>The puritans won't give up</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A literary struggle between liberals and conservatives</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | CAIRO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Richard Burton, a 19th-century British adventurer and linguist, published his translation of &#8220;The Thousand and One Nights&#8221; in 1885, many complained about the salacious scenes that previous bowdlerised editions had omitted. &#8220;We must remember that grossness and indecency&#8230;are matters of time and place,&#8221; wrote Mr Burton in his introduction, a year before he was knighted. &#8220;What is offensive in England is not so in Egypt.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of today&#8217;s Egyptians are acting as yesterday&#8217;s British Victorians. A group of Islamist lawyers calling itself &#8220;Lawyers Without Shackles&#8221; is taking Egypt&#8217;s ministry of culture to court for issuing a new edition of the Nights that is more faithful to the 1835 Cairene manuscripts that form the cornerstone of the canonical version of this famously fluid text. As in the West, various versions are available in Egypt, with the most popular ones aimed at children. A new distinctly adult-oriented one quickly sold out its first print-run, and the activist lawyers are trying to ensure there is no second printing. They are appealing to Article 178 of Egypt&#8217;s penal code, which punishes &#8220;with imprisonment for a period of two years anyone who publishes literature or pictures offensive to public decency&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Islamist Egyptians, going back to 1985, have tried to ban the bawdier editions of the Nights. Samia Mehrez, a professor at the American University of Cairo who recently wrote a book called &#8220;Egypt&#8217;s Culture Wars&#8221;, says the lawsuits serve a political rather than cultural purpose. &#8220;Cultural icons have been used as pawns in the political game between the state and the Islamists,&#8221; she says. &#8220;It is the Islamists&#8217; way of getting back at the state, by embarrassing it, for the violence it inflicts on them.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But it is not only Muslims who are twitchy. Yusef Zeidan, who won the Arabic Booker prize last year for his novel &#8220;Azazil&#8221;, is under attack from Christian activist lawyers emulating their Islamist peers also by citing Article 178. &#8220;Azazil&#8221;, meaning a devil, was an unlikely bestseller. Its theme is the fifth-century debate between Nestorius, Patriarch of Constantinople, and Cyril, Patriarch of Alexandria, over various arcane ecclesiastical and theological issues. Mr Zeidan, a Muslim scholar of religion, backs the Nestorians, depicting Cyril as fanatical and intolerant. This has upset some Coptic Christians, for whom Cyril is a revered founding father. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Gamal al-Ghitani, a leading novelist who edited the latest version of the Nights, has rallied fellow intellectuals in a defence of the tales in the literary magazine he runs, <em>Akhbar al-Adab</em>. Some think it preposterous to ban a work of literature that many in the rest of world admire as a shining symbol of Arab culture. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The authorities, including the minister of culture, Farouk Hosni, have remained silent in both cases, thereby irking liberal campaigners. But last time he spoke out, against an attempt in 2000 to ban a novel, &#8220;Banquet for Seaweed&#8221;, by a Syrian, Haydar Haydar, some Egyptian students rioted in protest against the book, which contains irreverent allusions to the Koran by jocular atheists. Still, the publishers stopped printing the novel, and even classical authors such as Abu Nuwas, a medieval poet known for his homoerotic verse who fled to Egypt from Baghdad because of censorship, were no longer published. This time, Mr Hosni has kept mum but the second print run of &#8220;The Thousand and One Nights&#8221; is going ahead, pending a court verdict. Judging by recent trends, the Islamist lawyers&#8217; case may be rejected. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These controversies have arisen just as publishing in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world has perked up, partly thanks to enterprising independent publishers and to a growing Western interest in Arab literature. A spate of new books, many of them tackling taboos, have appeared. Some conservatives have grumbled, especially about a trend towards the sexually explicit, but nothing akin to the agitation against &#8220;Banquet for Seaweed&#8221; has occurred. Despite efforts by the Islamists to invoke the law, the tide in Egypt&#8217;s culture wars may slowly be turning against them. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Now what?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Electoral defeat at home and the euro-zone rescue package have rocked Angela Merkel&#8217;s chancellorship. She now faces some tough decisions</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BERLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>MAY 9th is not a day Angela Merkel will soon forget. First voters in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany&#8217;s most populous state, booted the chancellor&#8217;s allies out of office, meting out her worst political drubbing in more than five years in office. That evening European finance ministers meeting in Brussels armed a financial bomb to deter speculators threatening the stability of the euro (see ). It seemed to work, but may also demolish Germans&#8217; long-term trust in the single currency. Both events will transform Mrs Merkel&#8217;s chancellorship.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The setbacks are at least partly of her own making. In NRW voters unseated a coalition between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) akin to the one she leads nationally. That was in part a slap at Mrs Merkel&#8217;s seven-month-old government. J\xFCrgen R\xFCttgers, the defeated CDU premier, had struggled against a &#8220;headwind&#8221; from Berlin, she acknowledged.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mrs Merkel is not to blame for the euro crisis but she dithered when it came, hoping that bail-outs of Greece and other shaky euro-zone members could be put off until after NRW&#8217;s election. That made them more expensive. &#8220;Three months ago, with a clear signal the situation would have calmed down,&#8221; says Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. &#8220;She misjudged the power and decisiveness of markets.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These misfortunes are symptoms of deeper problems. Mrs Merkel thrived as head of the CDU-Social Democratic Party (SPD) &#8220;grand coalition&#8221;, which governed Germany until last October. Normally the two parties are rivals. But that proved to be a blessing for a chancellor skilled at balancing factions, waiting out problems and then taking credit for resolving them. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The coalition with the FDP, supposedly the CDU&#8217;s &#8220;dream partner&#8221;, demands different skills. Mrs Merkel is no longer expected to mediate among a team of rivals but to lead a band of political brothers with coherent goals. It has not turned out that way. After 11 years in opposition, the FDP returned to power determined to put its stamp on government, above all by cutting taxes for the middle class. This split the coalition. CDU state premiers rushed to defend their threatened revenues. Wolfgang Sch\xE4uble, the flinty finance minister, is under constitutional orders to cut the federal government&#8217;s structural budget deficit almost to zero by 2016. The liberals&#8217; other big idea, a reform of health-care financing, is under fire from the CDU&#8217;s Bavarian wing, the Christian Social Union (CSU).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Merkel-the-mediator let through a bit of tax relief, including a cut in value-added tax for hotels, which voters deemed an egregious pander to the FDP. She deferred hard questions, such as how to square tax cuts with deficit reduction, until after the NRW election. Despite his new role as foreign minister, the FDP&#8217;s leader, Guido Westerwelle, pushed for more tax cuts and started a divisive debate about welfare. The Merkel-Westerwelle duo managed to appear timid and reckless at the same time. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>They paid the price on May 9th. The CDU&#8217;s vote dropped ten percentage points from the last NRW election in 2005 and the FDP won less than half the record 14.6% it achieved in last September&#8217;s federal election. Either party could continue in power, with various allies, but almost certainly not together (see ). Local issues, including a party-financing scandal, helped defeat Mr R\xFCttgers. But voters also used the opportunity to express anxiety about the euro. In opinion polls, a majority said that the Greek crisis played a role in their decision. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The defeat in NRW also strips Mrs Merkel&#8217;s government of its majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house of the legislature, which represents the states. To enact most money bills the government will now have to co-operate with the opposition. More ominously for Mrs Merkel, the loss ends the electoral winning streak that has shielded her from challengers within the CDU. A latecomer to politics, the chancellor has treated the party as a vehicle rather than as a home. Reserves of goodwill may now start to run dry.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a way, the NRW result plays to Mrs Merkel&#8217;s strengths. The new alignment of the Bundesrat will call on her mediating skills. But pressure will mount. Be bold, she is told, but do not offend the voters. Roland Koch, the powerful premier of Hesse, complained of &#8220;insufficient decisiveness&#8221; from the coalition. Yet NRW&#8217;s voters apparently rejected its boldest ideas: tax cuts, health reform and longer operating lives for nuclear power plants. Mrs Merkel should stand up to the FDP, demand some colleagues, but must avoid the squishy centrism of the grand coalition. Squabbling between the CDU and FDP was suicidal, but so, apparently, was compromise. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mrs Merkel&#8217;s immediate response was to jettison tax cuts &#8220;for the foreseeable future&#8221;. Deficit reduction will now take priority. With this, she pulls rank on Mr Westerwelle and positions herself as the guardian of economic stability. Deciding where the axe will fall is harder. Mr Koch suggests cuts to education and child care, precisely the areas where Mrs Merkel hopes to make her modernising mark as chancellor. It is no help that Mr Sch\xE4uble, who would wield the axe, was forced by illness to leave the euro crisis meetings in Brussels, sparking speculation that he might not long remain in office. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One way or another, the cautious Mrs Merkel will now have to run risks. Deficit reduction is popular in principle but will enrage lobbies. Health-care reform is no less necessary after the NRW election than it was before. Above all, the chancellor will have to help devise new ways of managing the euro and defend them to an electorate that is resentful of bail-outs, fearful about the currency&#8217;s stability and increasingly unwilling to identify Germany&#8217;s interests with Europe&#8217;s. &#8220;Once again, we&#8217;re Europe&#8217;s fools&#8221; was how <em>Bild</em>, an influential tabloid, greeted news of the euro rescue plan. Persuading Germans that <em>Bild </em>is wrong is a job for a stateswoman. Now is Mrs Merkel&#8217;s chance to become one. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Grand, traffic-light or red-red-green?</h1>\r\n\
    <h2> The complexities of coalition-building in German states</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BERLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>GERMANY is accustomed to hung parliaments. But the one elected on May 9th in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany&#8217;s most populous state, is more hung than usual. The &#8220;Christian-liberal&#8221; coalition of J\xFCrgen R\xFCttgers, consisting of his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP), lost its majority in the Landtag (state parliament). The winners are a left-leaning trio: the main opposition party, the Social Democrats (SPD), which fared worse than last time but better than expected; the Greens, who doubled their share of the vote; and the ex-communist Left Party, which enters NRW&#8217;s legislature for the first time. Neither of the familiar two-party coalitions (CDU-FDP or SPD-Greens) commands a majority. Any one of three possible groupings could emerge. The outcome will have national as well as regional implications. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The most conventional would be a &#8220;grand coalition&#8221; between the two biggest parties: the CDU and the SPD. These are uncommon but not unknown (Angela Merkel, the chancellor, led one at federal level until last October). In NRW the two parties differ on education, the top issue at state level. But a bigger problem is that, whereas the CDU won a few thousand more votes, the SPD feels like the winner. Its leader, Hannelore Kraft, will balk at serving as junior partner under Mr R\xFCttgers. Besides, she could lead one of two exotic alternatives. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>She could bring the Left Party into the government of a western state for the first time by forming an unprecedented &#8220;red-red-green&#8221; coalition. Neither the SPD nor the Greens are keen on the Left Party, whose NRW branch includes professed communists. Among voters, this is the least popular option. Mrs Kraft could go ahead anyway, hoping that governing in NRW would domesticate the Left Party, readying it for a possible coalition at national level in 2013. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At first, red-red-green seemed the only alternative to a grand coalition. That was until the FDP changed its mind and signalled it might join the SPD and the Greens in Germany&#8217;s first state-level &#8220;traffic-light coalition&#8221;. Having scorned the liberals during the election, the SPD and Greens now find them more appealing than the alternatives. A partnership with the liberals would help the Greens in their quest to reach beyond the left for coalition partners. The main question seems to be whether the FDP would prefer to be the third wheel in a left-leaning coalition over a spell in opposition. With five parties now the norm in German legislatures, such conundrums will surely become more common. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>A scandal brings down Turkey&#8217;s main opposition leader</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | ISTANBUL | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>HE HAS not won an election in almost 20 years. He has made a career of blocking reform. And now he has allegedly been caught in bed with his former private secretary. Yet Deniz Baykal, who on May 10th resigned as leader of Turkey&#8217;s main opposition grouping, the pro-secular Republican People&#8217;s Party (CHP), may survive nonetheless.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The scandal erupted on May 7th when Habervaktim, a radical Islamist website, published nine minutes of silent footage purportedly showing Mr Baykal, 71, and Nesrin Baytok (now a CHP deputy) milling around a bedroom semi-nude. The video emerged as Turkey&#8217;s parliament was voting on a crucial set of constitutional reforms aimed at trimming the powers of Turkey&#8217;s meddlesome generals and their allies in the judiciary. Mr Baykal, who had vowed to get the changes overturned, claims that the leak was timed to ward off this challenge. Yet some thought the camera might have been planted by Mr Baykal&#8217;s rivals within the CHP. Others still mused that pro-secularist forces within the army and elsewhere might have orchestrated the conspiracy in order to revive the CHP&#8217;s fortunes under a fresh leader ahead of parliamentary elections next summer.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Turkey&#8217;s mildly Islamist prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has denied any involvement and ordered a criminal investigation. Websites that posted the film, which appeared with the title &#8220;Sex Adventures with the CHP&#8221;, have been blocked.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But Turks have not seen the last of Mr Baykal. His supporters are gathering signatures for him to stay on as party leader. Some are staging a hunger strike outside his Ankara home. Although he has ruled out an immediate return, Mr Baykal is leaving the door ajar. &#8220;I cannot tell these people to go and mind their own business,&#8221; he said to a television news channel. He may continue to run the party he has led since 1992, albeit from behind the scenes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The lack of a credible opposition is a big weakness of Turkish democracy. So long as Mr Baykal remains in the picture there is little chance of the CHP winning power. Even if he were to withdraw fully, the ensuing power struggle within the party founded by Ataturk in 1923 is unlikely to be resolved in time for next year&#8217;s elections. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet perhaps the most telling aspect of the scandal is its resemblance, in some senses at least, to other shadowy goings-on in the continuing battle between Turkey&#8217;s pro-secular old guard and the new class of pious entrepreneurs symbolised by Mr Erdogan&#8217;s AK party. Covertly recorded conversations and videos have become a tactic to discredit rivals. A striking example is the evidence used to implicate suspects in the &#8220;Ergenekon&#8221; trial, which has been mounted against an alliance of security officials and civilians who are accused of seeking to foment chaos in order to justify a coup to overthrow AK. The pro-secular camp is widely believed to be keeping its own ammunition in reserve. Mr Baykal may not be the last Turkish politician to be caught in the act. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Euro not bust</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Estonia gets a green light to join the euro. Other Baltic states will benefit too</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SURPRISES are Estonia&#8217;s stock in trade. Its return to the world map in 1991 after a 51-year absence startled outsiders. So did what came next: a fast-growing economy, based on flat taxes, free trade and a currency board. In 2004 it confounded pessimists&#8217; expectations by joining the European Union and NATO. Now it is set to pull off another coup, gaining green lights from the European Commission and the European Central Bank in its bid to adopt the euro on January 1st 2011.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many thought that highly unlikely. Only two years ago a property bubble in the country popped, rocking the banking system and sending GDP plunging by 14.1% in 2009. Doom-mongers said devaluation was inevitable. But they were wrong. Flexible wages and prices have helped the economy stabilise: unit labour costs fell by 7.5% in the final quarter of 2009. Exports were up by a sixth in the first quarter of 2010 and the central bank forecasts growth this year of 1% (although that depends on the pace of recovery in Sweden and other export markets). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thanks to a fiscal tightening of a stonking 7.5% of GDP, Estonia easily meets the euro zone&#8217;s public-finance rules. Its gross debt in 2009 was only 7.2% of GDP (compared with 115% in Italy), and the government deficit is 1.7% (Greece&#8217;s is 13.6%). The concern is sustainability: will future governments be so thrifty? Inflation is low: in the past 12 months the average figure was negative, at -0.7% well below the euro zone&#8217;s 1% target. But the ECB report calls for &#8220;continued vigilance&#8221;, as well as efforts to raise productivity and competitiveness.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The real problem for Estonia is political, not economic. Some euro-zone members (France is often mentioned) think that allowing an obscure and volatile ex-communist economy to join a currency union that already has too many dodgy members should not be a priority. If Estonia is really so solid, why not wait a year to be sure?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet that would send a perverse message. Estonia is almost the only country in the whole EU that actually meets the common currency&#8217;s rules. All those that use the euro have gaily breached the deficit and debt limits. The grit shown by Estonian politicians and the public in shrinking spending, raising taxes and cutting wages has been exemplary. Punishing Estonia, which obeyed the rules, while bailing out Greece, which has breached them flagrantly, would do little for the euro&#8217;s credibility with governments and investors alike.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Estonia has two more hurdles to jump before it can scotch the scoffers: an EU committee meeting at the end of May, followed by a finance ministers&#8217; summit in early June. Few think that France and other doubters will actually block Estonia&#8217;s bid; persuasion and horse-trading will probably bring agreement. Then the decision will be irrevocable. That will give heart to Latvia and Lithuania, which hope to join the euro later in the decade. Like Estonia, their currencies are pegged to the euro, so they bear the pain of a rigid monetary regime, but also miss out on the lower borrowing costs and higher investment that membership of the currency can bring. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The next task is to stoke growth and cut unemployment (now over 15%). After that, the aim should be to reach Nordic-quality public services and an economy based on brainpower by 2018, when Estonia celebrates its 100th birthday and also holds the presidency of the EU. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>At least it's not Greece</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A public-finance squeeze has calmed markets but angered voters</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | DUBLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>VOLCANIC ash from Iceland has closed Ireland&#8217;s airports intermittently since mid-April. On May 7th, euro-zone leaders met in Brussels to consider a less tangible but more dangerous threat to Ireland&#8217;s limping economy: Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis. The fallout from Greece&#8217;s financial difficulties had raised the cost of Ireland&#8217;s borrowing to a record 3 percentage points over the German benchmark rate. Two days later, following agreement between the EU and the IMF on a &#8364;720 billion ($913 billion) fund to aid euro-zone governments in difficulty, the risk premium on Irish bonds narrowed sharply (see chart).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The meeting happened to coincide with the second anniversary of Brian Cowen&#8217;s election as taoiseach. But the Irish prime minister has few reasons to celebrate. At home, support for his centre-right coalition government is plummeting, partly because of a series of austerity measures imposed since 2008. Aiming to reduce the budget deficit, which at 14.3% of GDP is the highest in the EU, to 3% by 2014, Mr Cowen&#8217;s government has imposed public-sector wage cuts, raised taxes and cut spending. Further pain, including a broadening of the tax base and the introduction of water charges, may be on the way.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such measures will squeeze a country already reeling from recession. Real GDP declined by 9.9% between 2007 and 2009, and this year unemployment is predicted to average 13.7%. Mr Cowen feels the heat of public anger not only because of his government&#8217;s belt-tightening but because he is widely perceived to have failed to curb the excesses of Ireland&#8217;s housing-led economic boom during his tenure as finance minister, between 2004 and 2008.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The austerity measures have at least proved popular in financial markets. Bond investors no longer regard Ireland as the euro&#8217;s weakest link, as they did in March last year. The European Commission recently revised its growth forecast for the Irish economy upwards, to a healthy 3% for next year. The euro&#8217;s sharp fall in recent months should help boost exports outside the euro zone. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But domestic worries remain. A recent deal between government and trade unions on public-sector pay, which included pledges of no further cuts for four years, may be rejected by union members still fuming over earlier measures. Even so, token protest seems more likely than strikes; Ireland has shown little appetite for Greek-style demonstrations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Politically, the outlook is uncertain. The government&#8217;s majority has steadily eroded since 2007, mainly through resignations. And some in Mr Cowen&#8217;s Fianna Fail party have questioned his leadership, though it has not been seriously challenged&#8212;at least not yet. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Centrifugal forces</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>As Italy prepares to celebrate the 150th anniversary of its unification, its coalition government is fraying at the edges</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | ROME | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;I AM a Florentine,&#8221; declares an acquaintance of your correspondent. &#8220;A Tuscan? With difficulty. An Italian? Never!&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Italy approaches the 150th anniversary of its unification next year, it appears that quite a few of his compatriots harbour similar feelings. Two polls published this week found 10-11% of Italians thought the unification of their country was a mistake. In one, conducted for <em>Corriere della Sera</em>, over half of respondents said Italians were not a &#8220;single people&#8221;. The other poll, for <em>La Repubblica</em>, found that 15% of Italians, including 10% of southerners, would be happy for the rich north to break away.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the positive side of the ledger, 88% said they were proud of their country. But the reasons most cited were Italy&#8217;s physical beauty, cultural heritage and cuisine. Only 14% regarded Italy&#8217;s economy and entrepreneurs as sources of pride.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Against this background it is perhaps not surprising that the arrangements for next year&#8217;s festivities have encountered difficulties. The chairman of the oversight committee, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a former president of Italy, has resigned (ostensibly for health reasons), and two ministers in Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s conservative coalition&#8212;both of them from the Northern League, including the party&#8217;s leader, Umberto Bossi&#8212;say they may boycott the celebrations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The League, which appeals to northern resentment of the south&#8217;s alleged profligacy and indolence, is the minority partner in Mr Berlusconi&#8217;s coalition. In March, a sparkling performance in regional elections enhanced its influence. That may help explain why Mr Berlusconi&#8217;s party, the People of Freedom (PdL), which rarely misses an opportunity to wrap itself in the national flag, has struggled to put forward proposals for the 2011 events: the federalists of the League look sceptically upon celebrations of pan-Italian unity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On April 22nd, at a meeting of the PdL&#8217;s governing assembly, the party&#8217;s failure to plan for next year was one cause of a public airing of the tensions inside Italy&#8217;s governing coalition. Gianfranco Fini, the lower-house speaker who helped create the PdL in 2008 by merging his own, formerly neo-fascist, National Alliance with Mr Berlusconi&#8217;s Forza Italia, publicly berated the party&#8217;s laxity. The event soon degenerated into a shouting match between Mr Fini and the prime minister.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The awkward relationship between Mr Fini and the Northern League is also starting to take its toll. With his power base in Italy&#8217;s centre and south, Mr Fini has never found it easy to rub along with the members of a northern regionalist party. But now they have ideological differences too. The League is reactionary, particularly on immigration. Mr Fini, by contrast, has moved ever farther towards the centre in an attempt to create a new brand of Italian conservatism. He supports votes for immigrants, a bigger role for parliament and more democracy within the PdL.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So far, Mr Fini&#8217;s modernisation project is looking forlorn. In April he announced plans to create an organised faction within the PdL. His associates claim he has the support of about 50 MPs. But when the PdL assembly came to vote he failed to attract that level of support, and his plans are now on ice.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some believe Mr Fini&#8217;s maverick stance might prompt Mr Berlusconi to call a snap election. But that could lead to the League repeating its regional success on a national scale. As it is, Mr Bossi&#8217;s party seems likely to shape the agenda for the rest of the current legislature, which expires in 2013. Top of its list is &#8220;fiscal federalism&#8221;, the transfer of further financial power to the regions. This could be parliament&#8217;s main task in the year of Italy&#8217;s 150th birthday; paradoxical for some, but appropriate in the eyes of Mr Bossi, who argues that federalism was central to the ideas of Italy&#8217;s first prime minister, the Count of Cavour. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Supporters of fiscal decentralisation argue it will boost regional performance, in both north and south. But it also poses dangers. Now that the euro has been saved from the immediate danger of implosion (see ), Brussels (and Berlin) will be pressing the euro zone&#8217;s Mediterranean member states to introduce structural economic reforms, while making the cuts needed to contain their deficits and reduce their public debts. Drawing up plans for fiscal federalism could distract government attention from the need for such reform. And if countries like Spain are anything to go by, the immediate effect of any decentralisation will not be to reduce public spending, but to increase it. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The euro-zone rescue package does not mean common economic government. But the rules are clearly changing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SINCE 1949, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty has bound NATO members to a solemn vow: an armed attack on one of the alliance shall be treated as an attack against all. With international markets closed to Greece, and contagion threatening Portugal and Spain, European Union leaders agreed to a similar pledge after a pair of gruelling, late-night meetings on May 7th and 9th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From now on, they in effect declared, markets betting against one member of the euro zone would meet a swift response from all 16. Emergency finance would be channelled to vulnerable governments from an array of fighting funds of up to &#8364;750 billion ($950 billion) variously loaned or guaranteed by EU countries, euro-zone members and the IMF (see ).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Markets rallied, for a day or two at least. There was shock in Germany, where critics in the press and parliament accused Chancellor Angela Merkel of allowing the EU to become a &#8220;transfer union&#8221;, in which countries that stuck to EU rules would find their cash siphoned to the profligate. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>From France there was crowing. President Nicolas Sarkozy claimed credit for a plan that he called &#8220;95%&#8221; French. He hailed the emergence of a new decision-making body at the EU&#8217;s inner core, made up of leaders from the 16 euro-zone countries. Such a &#8220;council of the euro zone&#8221;, as he called it, is not found in any EU treaty, but has been a French dream for years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Britain a scandalised press claimed the country could pay out anything between \xA310 billion ($15 billion) and \xA343 billion to prop up a single currency it did not even use. (The outgoing chancellor, Alistair Darling, said the real sum was \xA38 billion at most.)</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This much is clear: the &#8364;750 billion plan is only a temporary fix. The scheme is designed to protect weak links in the euro zone for the next three years, buying them the breathing space to shore up public finances, clean up banks and retool uncompetitive economies so they can grow again and pay off their debts. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t succeed in restoring sound fundamentals in most of the euro zone, this crisis will come back,&#8221; admits a senior European politician.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What the scheme is not is a giant leap towards a common economic government, with the power to siphon huge sums from rich to poor bits of the union. It looks more like a mutual defence pact: an attack on one euro-zone member is now an attack on all. Countries that sign up to NATO&#8217;s Article 5 make a serious commitment. They are asked to send troops for joint training, spend a certain amount on defence and so on. But their pact does not mean there is a single NATO army.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Nevertheless, the rules of the euro zone&#8212;supposedly based on a Germanic vision of budgetary discipline and an independent European Central Bank (ECB)&#8212;are clearly in flux. The ECB started buying government bonds on the financial markets on May 10th: precisely the step urged on it by EU politicians and big banks. Allies of the ECB&#8217;s boss, Jean-Claude Trichet, insist he was reacting to market pressures, not assaults on his independence. But the episode caused angst in Germany, and beyond.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EU leaders agreed to a &#8364;60 billion facility controlled by the European Commission, funded by borrowing against the EU&#8217;s central budget, and so ultimately guaranteed by all 27 members of the EU. The legal basis was a bit of the Lisbon treaty that empowers the commission to send emergency money to countries hit by natural disasters or other &#8220;exceptional&#8221; crises. But leaders resisted a second, much more ambitious move by the commission: to use the same treaty clause to create a stabilisation fund of unlimited size that it would also control, this time borrowing against loan guarantees from national governments.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Instead, at the insistence of Germany and allies like the Netherlands and Finland, the largest part of the euro-zone defence system, a war chest of up to &#8364;440 billion, will be run as a &#8220;special purpose vehicle&#8221; controlled by national governments. It will not be controlled by the commission, and will issue money only under tough conditions set by the IMF.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Are you with us, Dave?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet if the new euro-zone scheme has not centralised power, it is an open question whether power is flowing to the euro countries, creating an &#8220;inner core&#8221; of 16 at the expense of outliers like Britain. On the one hand, Germany remains wary of a powerful euro zone, fearing that the French want to build up a political body with the clout to bully the ECB. Basically, sighs a senior figure, the French still think of Mr Trichet as &#8220;a civil servant, appointed by the French government&#8221;. Moreover, although Germany and France may both talk about enhanced economic governance, they mean very different things by it: for France, interventionism; for Germany, the harmonisation of rigour.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the other hand, there is much grumbling about Britain&#8217;s refusal to join the larger &#8364;440 billion defence scheme, when British banks are heavily exposed in places like Spain and Ireland, through cross-ownership and debt holdings (and when Poland and Sweden, which like Britain do not use the euro, will join in). On May 9th a &#8220;furious&#8221; Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, confronted Mr Darling, sources say. Other finance ministers asked aloud whether Britain could expect EU solidarity if the pound came under attack.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If Gordon Brown had stayed on as prime minister, it is said, he might have joined the euro-zone defence scheme, though Britain&#8217;s Treasury was opposed. To David Cameron&#8217;s new government, even with the pro-European Liberal Democrats on board, the very idea may sound fantastical. But it is not: if contagion hits Spain, for instance, Britain will face calls for EU solidarity.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Cameron says he wants to avoid distracting Euro-rows as he takes office. He may not be able to avoid them. </p>\r\n\

    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CHANGE, indeed. On the campaign trail, David Cameron and Nick Clegg often sounded nebulous as they pledged a break from the past. They could not have envisaged keeping their promise in such concrete and spectacular fashion. As Conservative prime minister and Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister, they now run the first coalition government that Britain has seen since 1945. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some kind of collaboration between previously antagonistic politicians was likely after the May 6th general election returned a hung parliament. Despite a fanciful attempt to cobble together a Labour-led coalition by Gordon Brown, who resigned as prime minister on May 11th, the Tories, as the largest party, had the political high ground in forming a new administration. But minority Conservative rule, backed on a bill-by-bill basis by the Lib Dems, seemed likelier than joint government.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deal, reached after days of tortuous haggling, gives Mr Clegg&#8217;s party five seats at the cabinet table and several junior ministers. The Tories&#8217; George Osborne will run the Treasury but Vince Cable and David Laws, both Lib Dems, will also fight the economic and fiscal crises as business secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury respectively. Some basics have been agreed upon: \xA36 billion ($9 billion) of savings will be made this year, and various welfare goodies will be withdrawn from higher-earners. An emergency budget is expected in June. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The coalition makes strategic sense for Mr Cameron, who pushed for it from the start. Fiscal retrenchment will enrage voters; the Tories can now share the flak with the Lib Dems. The immemorial threat of Liberalism and Labourism combining to lock the right out of power has also been seen off for some time. More prosaically, some of the Tories&#8217; less fetching ideas (such as exempting all but the richest from inheritance tax) and people (namely Chris Grayling, who never convinced as a potential home secretary) have been bloodlessly cut loose as part of the compromise. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are benefits for the Lib Dems too. Real power for the first time in the better part of a century is no small bauble. If the coalition works, voters may warm to the idea of power-sharing, and to the proportional voting systems that inevitably give rise to it. (A referendum on the alternative-vote electoral model, which the Lib Dems prefer over Westminster&#8217;s first-past-the-post system, is part of the deal.) And the Lib Dems got all this despite flopping at the polls. Their vote share, 23%, was sizeable but barely more than they won last time.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When the dust settles, though, the coalition may not strike them as such a coup. One of their cabinet posts, secretary of state for Scotland, has been anachronistic since powers were devolved to Edinburgh in 1998. Their most substantial brief, that held by Mr Laws, is the ultimate poisoned chalice. It will be his job to decide where the budgetary axe will fall.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Lib Dems are passionate about their pro-Europeanism, their liberal take on crime and their dovishness on military and foreign matters. But with Tories in charge of home affairs (Theresa May), foreign affairs (William Hague), defence (Liam Fox) and justice (Ken Clarke), they will not get their way on these issues. Welfare and the big public services are also in Tory hands. And many of the Lib Dem policies that have been accepted by the Tories, such as aiming to free low-earners from income-tax and contemplating cuts to NHS spending, are ones no centre-right party would struggle to swallow anyway.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But there is a deeper, almost existential problem looming for the Lib Dems. Many of their voters are left-leaning; some back the party only because Labour is not competitive locally. Once the novelty of power wears off and the agony of austerity begins, these voters could migrate to a Labour Party rendered more Liberal-friendly by a non-tribal leader such as David Miliband (the former foreign secretary and favourite to take over the party). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>None of this is to suggest that Mr Clegg has been foolish. The left curse his &#8220;betrayal&#8221; but a deal with a defeated Labour Party was never a serious option, as plenty of grown-ups on both sides understood from the start. The parliamentary numbers were not there; neither was the moral legitimacy. Still, he must know that his gamble could bring about another, this time foreseeable, death of Liberal England. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The coalition itself may not survive the full five-year parliamentary term pledged by the parties. Disagreements between them on European integration and the balance between liberty and security remain quite profound, despite cosmetic agreement to resist the euro (hardly a controversial judgment at the moment) and pass a rather overblown &#8220;freedom bill&#8221;. But if the coalition does not endure for five years, neither is it certain to implode as quickly as Labour might hope. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For one thing, the parties have in common not only some specific policies but a broader critique of the state as over-centralised and bureaucratic. The Lib Dems stress good old-fashioned local government, while the Tories are keener on <em>avant-garde</em> ideas to hand over money and responsibility to people directly. But it all amounts to giving power away. (Tellingly, Mr Clegg did not disparage the Tories&#8217; &#8220;big society&#8221; theme during the campaign).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Secondly, personalities matter. The inevitable drollery about &#8220;Nick Cameron&#8221; and &#8220;David Clegg&#8221; will do the rounds whenever the two men appear together but they really are, in background, age and temperament, very similar (see ). Their lieutenants are also eminently compatible, as the negotiations showed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But what really argues for a lasting coalition is base politics. Neither party wants another election in the next few years. Austerity will be crushingly unpopular. The Lib Dems face a reckoning with their left-wing voters. From a certain angle, the coalition could begin to look less like a 1931-style national administration than a government of the southern rich, by the southern rich, for the southern rich. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The problem is that, although compromising to keep the show on the road might be the &#8220;new politics&#8221;, it could make for bad economics. Often over the coming years, the exact opposite of compromise, difference-splitting and cosy half-measures will be needed to deal with a debt crisis big enough to make even the drama of the past week look like a frivolous sideshow. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Learning how to share</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Personalities no less than procedure help to make coalitions work elsewhere</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THERE was high-flown talk this week of a &#8220;seismic shift&#8221; in British politics. Perhaps so. But the sight of parties negotiating to share office (or not) after an inconclusive election is common enough in much of Europe: Norwegians and Germans, for example, have been chortling at excitable Brits over the past few days. Increasingly that is also true farther afield, even in corners which had long shared Britain&#8217;s system of government.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Canadian voters, who have repeatedly delivered hung parliaments since 2004, have now accepted minority rule. Stephen Harper&#8217;s Conservatives have governed for four and a bit years and are likely to stay on for a while yet. Mr Harper is abrasive and presides over a rancorous parliament, but his government is stable and the economy chugs happily along. The country has seen 11 minority administrations in the past century, yet those with strong leaders have managed both to endure and to deliver big legislative changes. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other bits of the former empire offer lessons, too. Post-apartheid South Africa uses a list system of proportional representation (PR) and it has had various coalitions since 1994. Care is taken, for example with ministerial appointments, to protect the interests of ethnic minorities (such as whites) who are otherwise easily outvoted. Australia uses a mix of voting systems but keeps constituency links for Mps. New Zealand dropped British-style first-past-the-post voting in 1996 and has seen only hung parliaments and coalition rule since. That has not always been smooth, but politicians have learned that it pays to be flexible, for example by finding ways for ministers from small parties to be excused from collective responsibility on certain sensitive issues. Voters in New Zealand are unlikely to scrap their voting system in a referendum on it next year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The intriguing question is whether more consensual rule ends up producing a different kind of government policy. Some economists and political scientists are convinced that coalition typically leads to bigger states. Guido Tabellini, an Italian expert, says that where parliaments are formed under PR, governments have historically run slightly bigger budget deficits than those under single-party rule. And in countries where PR is the electoral system, central governments spend on average a &#8220;whopping&#8221; 5% more of GDP than countries with single-party governments.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Arend Lijphart, a Dutch academic who has looked at the performance of 36 democracies in recent decades, also says that coalition rule usually means more state spending. He points as well, however, to higher voter turnout, greater voter satisfaction, less income inequality and a &#8220;kinder, gentler and more generous&#8221; state all around. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Why might this be? Perhaps none of this is causal: richer countries with bigger welfare states may just plump for voting systems that produce coalition governments. Or perhaps parties in coalition see little to gain individually from fiscal prudence and, in a more representative government, have a wider range of supporters who need rewards.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Sprucing up democracy</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>More unites the Tories and Lib Dems than divides them</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DAVID CAMERON is in many ways a rather traditional Tory. Unlike some of his more ideological colleagues, he prefers to take the world as it is rather than rage that it is not as he would like it. He quickly concluded after May 6th that allying himself with the cause of modest electoral reform was a price worth paying for power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For the Liberal Democrats, changing the first-past-the-post voting system that discriminates against them has long been the holy grail. The Conservative promise of a referendum on the alternative-vote (AV) system trumped a superior, but ultimately undeliverable, offer by Labour of more radical reform. A coalition was born.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AV is not proportional representation. It allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets more than 50% of first-preference votes, the second choices of those who supported the weakest candidate are redistributed repeatedly until one gets an absolute majority. The Electoral Reform Society, a pressure group, points out that AV can produce results as perverse as first-past-the-post. But if it had been used in this year&#8217;s election, the group thinks the Lib Dems would have won 22 more seats than the 57 they got&#8212;all of them, interestingly, from the Tories.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Labour offered to enact AV and conduct a referendum on a much more proportional system, the single transferable vote (STV). Under STV votes are cast for candidates in big, multi-member constituencies, by order of preference. If the voter&#8217;s first choice does not need the ballot, either because he can be elected without it or because he has too few votes to get in with it, the ballot is transferred to the voter&#8217;s second choice, and so on. STV would virtually guarantee that no single party could achieve an overall majority at Westminster. If it had been in operation for this election, the Conservatives would have won 246 seats, Labour 207 and the Lib Dems 162, the Electoral Reform Society estimates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Though the prize was considerable, as was the enticing prospect of a more or less permanent coalition government based on a &#8220;progressive alliance&#8221; of the centre-left, the Lib Dems did the maths (together with Labour they do not have a majority) and calculated the cost to their reputation of putting electoral reform ahead of the expressed wishes of the electorate. At the end of the day, said one Lib Dem negotiator, the Tories were &#8220;the only game in town&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Changing the Westminster voting system, more or less radically, is now on the political agenda. So too is a much broader look at reforming institutions. And here all three main parties agree on a lot, although the devil is in the detail. All want the House of Lords to be wholly or largely elected under a proportional voting system. All have similar ideas for cleaning up MPs&#8217; expenses and lobbying, giving voters the right to recall MPs who have broken the rules and forcing lobbyists to operate more transparently, with particular restrictions on former ministers. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Labour and the Lib Dems both promised fixed-term parliaments in their election manifestos and the Tories, as part of the agreement with their new partners, have now come into line. The prime minister will no longer have the power to call an election when it suits him: parliaments will run for five years and will only be dissolved if the government loses a no-confidence or dissolution motion by a &#8220;supermajority&#8221;&#8212;a safety valve that may be particularly necessary when a potentially fractious coalition is in power.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In other areas, it is the Lib Dems and Tories who are closest, for example in their zeal for decentralising power and defending civil liberties (the latter a relatively new departure for the Tories, who used to be thought of as the authoritarian party). More specifically, both are keen to cut the cost of politics, reduce the number of MPs and reform campaign finance by limiting the size of individual contributions&#8212;all issues that cause problems for Labour. In short, while they will continue to differ about electoral reform, when it comes to wider political reform more unites the coalition partners than divides them. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Emerging from the shadow</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Labour needs a long leadership contest to shake off the Blair/Brown era</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SIXTEEN years ago this week, John Smith, Labour&#8217;s leader, suffered the fatal heart attack that ushered in the era of New Labour and the extraordinary Blair/Brown duopoly that finally petered out in the early evening of May 11th when Gordon Brown resigned. Such was their dominance that little could grow in the giant shadow they cast, certainly not senior colleagues who might one day aspire to the leadership. This is why Mr Brown, for all his previously well-known flaws, succeeded Mr Blair without a contest. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But if Labour is in some sense liberated by Mr Brown&#8217;s departure, it is also exhausted after 13 years in office. The party badly needs a period to reflect on where it wants to go and what it wants to be. It must also think seriously about how opposition to a new kind of government should be conducted. Labour has an acting head in its former deputy leader, Harriet Harman, who is not seeking the permanent role. Although the coalition government may not last the five years it is aiming for, there will not be another general election soon. Labour could and probably should therefore follow the example of the Tories after their defeat in 2005 and opt for a drawn-out leadership contest climaxing at the party conference at the end of September. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The new leader will almost certainly be male and in his forties. Alan Johnson, the one potential contender from the older generation, quickly ruled himself out and offered his support to David Miliband, the former foreign secretary. The first to declare his candidacy publicly (and the bookies&#8217; favourite), Mr Miliband is widely seen as the most Blairite of the candidates, although it is a mantle he wears a little uneasily. Charming, intelligent, articulate in a slightly wonkish way and an increasingly confident minister, he ticks a lot of the right boxes. Had Labour cut a deal with the Lib Dems, his all-round niceness and lack of tribalism would probably have made him a shoo-in to succeed Mr Brown.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet there are doubts. He is seen by some as lacking the necessary ruthlessness. It is said (a bit unfairly) that his refusal to challenge Mr Brown after Mr Blair&#8217;s departure, and his reticence on two subsequent occasions when Mr Brown was vulnerable, owed more to timidity than to loyalty. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is likely that Mr Miliband&#8217;s main rival will be Ed Balls, the former schools secretary, who was Mr Brown&#8217;s right-hand man and enforcer during his ten years at the Treasury. Mr Balls is clever, tough and ambitious, but his thuggish ways, in particular his brutal vendettas against colleagues on behalf of Mr Brown, have left him with an uncomfortably large number of enemies. Over the past few years he has assiduously staked out a position slightly to the party&#8217;s left by stalling some of Mr Blair&#8217;s market-leaning education reforms. He has also courted the unions and party members who, together with the MPs at Westminster, make up Labour&#8217;s electoral college. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The real standard-bearer of the left, however, will probably be Jon Cruddas, a backbencher supported by Compass, a well-organised Labour pressure group. Mr Cruddas has earned a reputation as an independent thinker, and talks a lot about the need for the party to reconnect with its traditional working-class supporters. Popular and unsullied by the compromises of office, Mr Cruddas will win some support, but he is seen more as a potential deputy leader, perhaps to Mr Miliband. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Of the other possible candidates, the most intriguing is Ed Miliband, David&#8217;s younger brother. Mr Brown&#8217;s energy secretary, Mr Miliband is almost as close to the former prime minister as Mr Balls, but he has cleaner hands and more cordial relations with the remaining Blairites. Mr Miliband may not run against his brother, but it is rumoured that his mother, widow of the fiery Marxist sociologist Ralph, is encouraging him. Personable, talented and a little to the left of David, he has friends and admirers on all sides of the party. Labour&#8217;s next leader will be either an Ed or a Miliband or, possibly, both. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Why Cameron coalesced</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A long-term shift in voter preferences means coalition was the only way to go</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BRITAIN&#8217;S first-past-the-post voting system is meant to deliver a clear majority to the party that comes first in seats, thereby avoiding any need for special deals and alliances to determine who enters Number 10. Until the election on May 6th only one post-war contest, in February 1974, had failed to produce a clear winner. And even that did not result in a coalition. Within six months of the first election, a second gave the incumbent (minority) Labour government a narrow majority.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So some were surprised this time when the leader of the party with the most seats and votes, David Cameron, opted for partnership with the Liberal Democrats although the more obvious course seemed minority government and a quick second election. Even more remarkably, to secure co-operation, the Conservatives agreed to Lib Dem demands for a referendum on switching to an electoral system that would make hung parliaments more likely.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet Mr Cameron may have been on to something. For the hung parliament that emerged on May 6th was no accident. It was a result of long-term changes in the electoral map of Britain that have eroded the ability of first-past-the-post to live up to its traditional billing.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The system is supposed to discourage people from voting for third parties. In 1951 only 3% of votes were cast for candidates other than those representing the Conservative or Labour Party. This time no less than 35% were, the highest proportion since 1918. First-past-the-post no longer ensures that elections are a two-horse race.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It has also become less effective at stopping whatever votes are cast for third parties from being converted into seats. In 1983 the former Liberal/SDP Alliance won 25% of the vote, but only 23 seats. This time, with 23%, the Lib Dems won 57 seats. Their vote is less evenly spread across the country than support for the old Alliance was. This ensures that the party wins slightly fewer second places and rather more first places than its predecessor did. And the greater the number of third-party MPs, the greater the chances of a hung parliament.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But there have been important changes in the way the system treats the Conservatives and Labour, too. Compare what happened on May 6th with the outcome in 1979. David Cameron had a seven-percentage-point lead over Labour, just as big as that obtained by Margaret Thatcher 31 years ago. Her reward, in stark contrast to his, was an overall majority of 44.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Two important developments largely explain this. First, far fewer seats these days are close contests between Labour and the Tories. As a result, for every one-point national swing in votes between those two parties, fewer seats change hands. This makes it harder for either of them to acquire a majority.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Second, the system still treats the Conservatives more harshly than Labour. Seats won by the Tories have larger electorates; the average Conservative constituency on May 6th had 4,000 more names on the electoral roll than the typical Labour one. At the same time, turnout is typically some seven points higher in Conservative-held seats, and the party wins rather fewer seats than Labour by small majorities. The result is that more Tory votes are &#8220;wasted&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The resulting bias against the Conservatives actually lessened a little on May 6th, thanks partly to less pronounced patterns of voter turnout. If the ups and downs in the party&#8217;s fortunes had occurred uniformly across the country, Mr Cameron would have won only 291 seats rather than the 307 he is likely to have obtained once the delayed election in Thirsk and Malton is held later this month. But that does not mean it has become easier for the Tories to win a majority. For the gap between Labour and Tory Britain widened on May 6th, thereby reducing the number of marginal seats.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The swing to the Tories was greatest in seats they already held. In contrast Scotland, already almost Tory-free, actually swung further towards Labour. Labour&#8217;s vote also held up relatively well in London, especially in seats with large ethnic minorities. There are now even fewer constituencies that reflect the national mood.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So the range of results likely to produce a hung parliament is now very wide. Before May 6th it looked as though Labour could win a majority simply by having the same share of the vote as the Conservatives. Now they need a three-point lead to do so. Meanwhile the Conservatives&#8217; target lead for an absolute majority is, at 11 points, just as high as it was before.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Little wonder, then, that Mr Cameron decided not to bet on a second election, as Harold Wilson did in 1974. It would probably have resulted in yet another round of hung-parliament haggling. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Good news, for hobbits</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Two views on new banking rules are better than one</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR those in favour of sensible financial reform a coalition may well come up with better ideas than either partner individually. Conservative plans risked throwing bank regulation into turmoil; the Liberal Democrats&#8217; vision threatened fragmentation and parochial Hobbit-town banking. A compromise between the two should in any event go further and faster than the efforts of the late Labour government, which was too beholden to the ill-fated regulatory regime it had created.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Before the election, the Tories had vowed to abolish the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and give its job as financial watchdog to the Bank of England, which would have been horribly complex. The solution now emerging is to give the Bank of England responsibility for banks and other entities big enough to affect the system and for oversight of &#8220;micro-prudential regulation&#8221;. The FSA may live on, under the Bank of England&#8217;s beady eye, as the detailed examiner of banks, investment firms and insurers, perhaps ceding customer protection to a new agency. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Lib Dems have the more radical ideas on reform. Vince Cable, the party&#8217;s Treasury spokesman and now business secretary in the new government, has talked of breaking up banks, shrinking them and separating retail- and investment-banking activities. That is not ruled out under the new government&#8217;s plans, but any moves in that direction will be hedged with impact studies (a special commission will have a year to report) and an eye will be kept on moves elsewhere, especially in America. The Conservatives like proposed curbs there on risk-taking by banks which have insured retail deposits. The so-called Volcker rule would prevent such banks from taking risky trading positions or investing in hedge funds and private-equity firms. Coincidentally, Paul Volcker, a former chairman of America&#8217;s Federal Reserve and proposer of the rule, was expected in London on May 13th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The coalition partners support a levy on banks, to provide a cushion for future shocks or to pay for past excesses, and they favour curbs on bankers&#8217; bonuses. These suggestions are already part of an international proposal by the IMF. The Conservatives would prefer to tax balance-sheet size whereas the Lib Dems would go for profits, but they share a goal of raising at least \xA31 billion a year. Both want to expand an existing government loan-guarantee scheme and to set tougher net lending targets for the nationalised banks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Tory and Lib Dem long-term ideas about banking in Britain are different, but may turn out not to be mutually exclusive. The Lib Dems would like to see the market less focused on London and banks owned by their customers where possible. That would include reviving regional stock exchanges to finance local businesses. The Post Office, for its part, would act as a safety net, offering banking to the far-flung and financially excluded. But all this might dilute the importance of the City of London as a big financial centre, a prospect that troubles the Conservatives.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Tories have their own populist agenda: the creation of a Big Society Bank to distribute funds from dormant bank accounts and a Green Investment Bank to back low-carbon industry. The Lib Dem version is an Infrastructure Bank to direct private finance into new rail services and green energy. A synthesis is to emerge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over the next few months the Office of Fair Trading may look harder at competition in banking, in particular at the level of fees charged to businesses by investment banks. Mr Cable also sits on the Future of Banking Commission, set up by Which?, a consumer group. Over the past few months it has looked at the cross-subsidy between retail and investment banking in universal banks. Its conclusions, expected in June, may help the government to decide on how far the two activities should be split. Until then expect a tug-of-war between Hobbit-town and the City.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The end of the line for Britain&#8217;s biggest private finance initiative</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>AS GORDON BROWN left Downing Street on May 11th to make way for David Cameron and Nick Clegg, there was talk of legacies. Mr Cameron paid tribute to the ex-prime minister and the social changes his party had effected, saying the country was &#8220;more open at home and more compassionate abroad&#8221;. But a few days earlier, one of Mr Brown&#8217;s other, financial legacies&#8212;Britain&#8217;s biggest partnership between private capital and public services&#8212;was quietly coming apart. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 7th Transport for London (TFL) said it would take over Tube Lines, one of the two private firms contracted to upgrade London&#8217;s Underground under a 30-year private-public partnership (PPP) deal. It will pay \xA3310m to buy the shares from Bechtel and Amey, both engineering firms. Tube Lines will join Metronet, its bankrupt fellow-contractor, under TFL&#8217;s control. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It appears that Tube Lines&#8217; shareholders sold up because the firm was no longer as profitable as they had hoped. A recent wrangle over costs meant that Tube Lines would have to work for the next seven and a half years on a budget of \xA34.4 billion, \xA32.8 billion less than it had expected. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Few at TFL will shed any tears. Officials claim that effective renationalisation will allow for better co-ordination (especially over annoying weekend closures of lines) and &#8220;greater flexibility&#8221;. The partnership has been unpopular with TFL, and with London&#8217;s municipal government generally, since it was imposed on London by Mr Brown early in his tenure as chancellor of the exchequer. London&#8217;s mayors have resented the fettering of their power over one of the capital&#8217;s economic arteries. Ken Livingstone, the first mayor, tried to get the deal blocked in the courts. Boris Johnson, the present Conservative one, has been equally unimpressed, describing the famously convoluted contracts as &#8220;Byzantine&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In theory, the PPP was meant to harness the efficiency of the private sector and, in return for healthy profits, transfer risks to the firms doing the work. In fact neither Tube Lines nor Metronet could make the deals work. Metronet was badly managed, and risk transfer proved to be a mirage: the firm went bankrupt in 2007 and the government bailed out its creditors to the tune of about \xA32 billion. Conspiracy theorists insist that mayoral dislike of the contracts made TFL intransigent in its dealings with the two firms, something that TFL has always denied. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some think the premise of the deal was flawed. As the partnership was being put together, PricewaterhouseCoopers, a consultancy, predicted that the private sector could extract savings of up to 30%, a figure that informed the entire project. But the consultancy &#8220;published no adequate evidential basis for that figure&#8221;, says Stephen Glaister, an academic who has followed the saga (and now sits on Tube Lines&#8217; board). Before the contracts were signed, the Underground had barely an asset register for the firm to inspect. Terry Morgan, a former boss of Tube Lines, used to describe how his engineers had spent months checking wiring in tunnels and drawing circuit diagrams from scratch. Even TFL agrees that Tube Lines was better run than Metronet. Perhaps the hoped-for cost savings were simply not achievable.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Others say that private-sector efficiency could never have compensated for its higher costs of borrowing and requirement to turn a profit. Now that both firms have been swallowed by TFL, that proposition ought to be testable. But it may not be. On May 11th Chris Bolt, the PPP&#8217;s referee, published a review of Metronet&#8217;s old contracts, now also run in-house by TFL. It was &#8220;disappointing&#8221;, he said, to note that TFL had changed the way it did the accounts, making comparisons with Tube Lines, and pre-takeover Metronet, impossible. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>At home with Britain's new power couple</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>LONG-AWAITED events came to pass this week; and when they did, as in a modernist play or a spooky dream, they happened twice, with subtle variations. Twice Gordon Brown resigned: once in an apparent bid to keep his party in office, then in acknowledgment that its time was up. And twice David Cameron posed in front of the famous front door of his new home with a spouse: first, his marital one, Samantha; then with his new political partner, Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats and now, amazingly, deputy prime minister. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Among the commentariat, the world-weary view of Britain&#8217;s new coalition government is that it cannot last. Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are too hostile to each other; the economic and fiscal circumstances are too fissiparous; citing irreconcilable differences, one party will jilt the other sooner rather than later. Perhaps. But one reason to doubt the glum view is that Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron make a startlingly lovely couple. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most obviously, and to an extent that must rile some class-warrior Labourites, they have similar backgrounds and biographies. Both are expensively educated sons of the financier classes, who have spent most of their adult lives in one kind of politics or another (though Mr Clegg, with his European ancestry and Spanish wife, is much more cosmopolitan than Mr Cameron). Both are 43, tallish and, as Martin Amis writes of a certain kind of well-bred Englishman, &#8220;pointlessly handsome&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More important than that overlap, perhaps, both are well-adjusted human beings. You search in vain on both men&#8217;s shoulders for the chips that typically burden and motivate politicians. Both have strong marriages and beloved children. An even temperament is an asset in any leader; in such a fragile alliance, the shared congeniality may be vital. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then there are the similarities of their political situations. Each has tried to reorient his party&#8212;and drag it towards the other&#8217;s. Mr Clegg has made the Lib Dems more liberal, or at least more realistic, in economic matters. Mr Cameron has striven, if with frequent blips, to make the Tories more socially liberal. The new prime minister and his deputy probably agree with each other at least as much as they do with many in their own parties (on the unreconstructed Tory right, in Mr Cameron&#8217;s case, and the Lib Dem left in Mr Clegg&#8217;s). Both will thus be sensitive to the delicacies and risks of the other&#8217;s internal party management. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The two men have something else in common, which may perhaps derive from their ego-nurturing backgrounds. Both give the strong impression of not being in politics merely to survive or slither to the top. Rather, both have always seemed determined to do something big&#8212;buoyed by the innate confidence that they can, and also by a sense that they can always bugger off and do something else if they fail. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And they have done something big. Mr Cameron has long avowed an admiration for Disraeli. That reverence has generally been seen to refer to his Victorian predecessor&#8217;s &#8220;one nation&#8221; model of Conservatism. But this week, Mr Cameron has also emulated some of Disraeli&#8217;s strategic daring. Just as Disraeli seized the policy of voting reform for the Tories, Mr Cameron has this week hijacked the cause of &#8220;new politics&#8221; that had belonged to his opponents&#8212;embracing the logic of a hung parliament, an electoral outcome he recently regarded as calamitous, and yielding on reform of a constitution he had previously defended. He once seemed bold in style and speechmaking, but only timid and incremental in policymaking. Not any more.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Mr Clegg, meanwhile, has spent much of his time as leader of the Lib Dems being mocked and jeered by his adversaries. But, in small ways, he has always exhibited a bold streak, as in his willingness to criticise Britain&#8217;s strategy in Afghanistan. Now he has eschewed the easy comforts of opposition; and he decided against a lesser deal with the Tories, in which the Lib Dems would have supported Mr Cameron only on key parliamentary votes&#8212;allowing them to claim that they were acting responsibly, while distancing themselves from unpopular measures. Mr Clegg has gambled that the rewards and opportunities of government will compensate for the anger his choice will provoke among some Lib Dem voters. He now holds a more senior office than any British Liberal since Lloyd George. (Given the need for cross-party agreement, as well as his oversight of political reform, Mr Clegg&#8217;s post seems unlikely to be the non-job some think it is.)</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg have done something very big indeed. Between them, they have re-imagined British politics. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Double or quits</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Of course, it may not last. The initial coalition agreement, published on May 12th, permits disagreement between the partners on issues such as Britain&#8217;s nuclear deterrent, nuclear energy and the tax treatment of marriage. Such differences may prove easier to manage in theory than in practice. Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron plan to fix the current parliamentary term (and future ones) at five years. As the doubters prophesy, their coalition could well fall apart long before then.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, at their serendipitously sunny press conference, in the garden of Number 10 on May 12th, the optimism was almost irresistible, and so (apologies) were the nuptial metaphors. Mr Cameron introduced &#8220;the new deputy prime minister&#8221; with the relish of a groom referring to his &#8220;wife&#8221; for the first time in his wedding speech. They laughed off their previous altercations and indiscretions. The pair reminisced about the moment they realised together that, rather than just cohabiting in Parliament, they ought to get properly hitched in a coalition. Because of their compatibility, their government may at least survive long enough for them to do a bit of good. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Running for cover</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Both in Western Europe and the Muslim world (see ) the covering of female heads and faces is stirring passion&#8212;and posing a dilemma for governments</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | PARIS | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> STRIKING a balance between personal and religious freedom, and the ideals of common citizenship, is proving to be an enormous test for all European countries with large Muslim populations&#8212;especially when some seem determined to assert, or even caricature, the practices of their homelands. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Certain things are easily settled: virtually everybody in Europe agrees in abhorring female genital mutilation, as practised in bits of Africa; or the harsh punishment of children in Koranic schools, which has occurred in Britain. But in recent months a third controversy has shown up contrasts between European countries and within them. This is over female headgear&#8212;and in particular, forms of dress in which all, or virtually all, the face is hidden. These include the head-covering burqa; and the commoner niqab, in which only a slit is left for the eyes. The burqa, imposed on Afghan women by the Taliban, has become a catchall term for headgear in which the face is wholly or mainly concealed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Last month 136 of Belgium&#8217;s 138 lower-house legislators (who agree on little else, leaving their country near paralysis) voted to outlaw the burqa. Belgian police already have the right to stop people masking their faces, under an old security law; and in some cities this right is invoked to issue warnings to burqa-wearers, who number only a few dozen in the country. So it is hard to see what need the law serves. But a parliamentarian in Brussels said it created a rare moment of &#8220;pride in being Belgian&#8221; by &#8220;smashing the lock that has left quite a lot of women in slavery.&#8221; He hoped at least four European countries would follow. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> This week France&#8217;s parliament approved a resolution deploring full-face cover, and legislation is due shortly. In Switzerland one of the 26 cantons has voted to work for a nationwide ban; the justice minister, Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, backs a ban, at least in cantons that want it. The Dutch authorities considered outlawing the burqa, then stepped back. But in Europe as a whole, the idea of making people show their faces is no longer a xenophobic fantasy, but a mainstream political project.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> With a fresh election due in June, Belgium&#8217;s law is on hold; but it may be the first of many European bans on &#8220;all clothing hiding the face totally, or mostly.&#8221; Belgian women who wear the burqa in public will risk a modest fine or even seven days&#8217; jail. In Italy a woman was fined &#8364;500 ($630) last week for wearing the burqa in a town where the Northern League mayor had barred clothing that hinders police checks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The resolution passed by French legislators has no legal force but it has huge symbolic impact. Recalling the 1789 Declaration of Human Rights, it says the all-over veil &#8220;puts women in a relationship of subordination to men&#8221;. On grounds of &#8220;dignity&#8221; and &#8220;equality between men and women&#8221;, it judges the garment &#8220;contrary to the values of the republic&#8221;. A law to ban the burqa will go to cabinet on May 19th.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In some places such moves have been promoted by the far right. Italy&#8217;s Northern League, which wants a national burqa ban, is xenophobic. In Britain the anti-European United Kingdom Independence Party is the only party to agitate for a burqa ban. Ed Balls, a minister in the outgoing Labour government, said it was &#8220;not British&#8221; to tell people what to wear in the street. Jack Straw, a senior Labour figure who once voiced dismay over women who hid their face when meeting him, is still &#8220;fundamentally opposed&#8221; to a ban. And Barack Obama said in Cairo last year that Western countries should not be &#8220;dictating what clothes a Muslim woman should wear&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In France, by contrast, the backers of a ban are neither extremists nor fringe feminists. It was first mooted by Nicolas Sarkozy, the centre-right president, who said last year that the burqa was &#8220;not welcome&#8221; on French soil. The first to call for a parliamentary motion was Andr\xE9 Gerin, a Communist. This week&#8217;s resolution won broad support, including from the Socialists. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In many ways, the French move is the most intriguing test. France is home to Europe&#8217;s biggest Muslim minority, numbering 5m to 6m. It expects immigrants, or their offspring, of all faiths to adapt to French ways, not the other way round. France holds dear the ideal of <em>la\xEFcit</em>\xE9, a strict ban on religion in the public arena that emerged from anticlerical struggles in the 19th century. It was in the name of <em>la\xEFcit</em>\xE9 that France banned the Muslim headscarf (and other &#8220;conspicuous&#8221; religious symbols) in state schools in 2004. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> But France&#8217;s leaders do not cite <em>la\xEFcit\xE9 </em>as a reason for the burqa ban; to do so, they note, would mean accepting that hiding female faces is mandated by Islam. Most influential Muslims in France, including the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), an official body, and Fadela Amara, a female Muslim minister, reject that reading. Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the CFCM, says &#8220;no Koranic text prescribes the wearing of the burqa or niqab.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So the upcoming law&#8212;stating that &#8220;nobody may wear clothing that masks the face in any public place&#8221;&#8212;has been justified on two other grounds. One is security, and the need to be identifiable. (There was consternation earlier this year when two men clad in burqas robbed a post office near Paris.) The other is human dignity and equality between the sexes. &#8220;This is not a religious question,&#8221; argues Jean-Fran\xE7ois Cop\xE9, parliamentary leader of the ruling UMP party. Most French people view the burqa as a clear token of oppression; if libertarians defend it, this is seen as implying softness on ills such as domestic violence. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Recent news has reinforced that view. This week, in a town west of Paris, police arrested a man suspected of forcing his wife to wear the burqa, and of raping and beating her. (With such cases in mind, the upcoming French law would reserve the harshest penalties for a man found to have made his wife wear the burqa.) Mr Cop\xE9 firmly rejects the idea that France is unjustifiably curbing liberty. He notes that: &#8220;On Fifth Avenue, you do not have the liberty to walk down the street completely nude.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The motives of young French Muslim women&#8212;sometimes more inclined to hide their faces than their mothers were&#8212;are hotly contested. Many French analysts say a &#8220;re-veiling&#8221; trend among young girls reflects manipulation by zealots. Although no more than 2,000 women in France cover their face, the phenomenon is growing. Dounia Bouzar, a French Muslim anthropologist, told a parliamentary inquiry that many of the women were young. Intelligence sources say two-thirds are French nationals, and nearly a quarter converts. Many come from North Africa, where there is no face-covering tradition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> So France&#8217;s leaders are determined to press ahead. Two risks stand out. First, the ban, which some see as a ruse by Mr Sarkozy to woo far-right voters, may stigmatise Islam and create a defensive reaction. (This is why Mr Moussaoui, who dislikes the burqa, opposes a ban.) As the debate took off, a mosque in south-east France was sprayed with gunfire.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Second, it is unclear how the ban would work in practice. The Conseil d&#8217;Etat, the highest administrative court, has questioned the legal basis for the ban. And what about foreigners? Mr Cop\xE9 says that the ban would apply to visitors too: but would women from the Gulf states be hauled away from smart boutiques?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> And then there are other problems: how could one prove that a woman wore a burqa under orders from her menfolk? And isn&#8217;t there a risk of such women facing further isolation in the home? That would be an odd result for a law designed in part to ensure sexual equality.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Beyond the burqa</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>In Islam&#8217;s heartlands a covered head has more than one connotation</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | CAIRO AND ISTANBUL | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> IN MUSLIM countries, a conservative head-covering does not always mean being conservative in other ways. Just glance at a couple enjoying the romantic night air in Istanbul; her hair may be hidden, but the rest of her attire is hip-huggingly modern, and there is nothing restrained about the kiss she offers her boyfriend.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Odd as it might sound to Western ears, for many women in the Islamic world dressing &#8220;Islamically&#8221; may be a choice that has been freely taken for reasons of religion, politics or even fashion: one that is especially pointed in countries where the right to cover one&#8217;s head is restricted by law or secularist convention. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> There are some places, like Saudi Arabia and Iran, where women must cover their heads; in others, notably Turkey and Tunisia, female civil servants along with pupils in state education are banned from concealing their hair. To the horror of Turkey&#8217;s secular establishment, the wives of the president and prime minister both cover their heads; hence they are barred from many state institutions, including some hospitals. On April 29th a prosecutor quashed a claim from a secularist group that the two ladies had committed a crime by attending public ceremonies in scarves.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In the rest of the Middle East, most women don a veil of one kind or another, though almost none wears the burqa. In Iran many women defy the strictures of the Islamic republic&#8217;s dress-code with token scarves, short coats and heavy make-up. They suffer in an annual campaign against &#8220;bad hijab&#8221;, kicking off now. In spring and summer women whose scarves are deemed flimsy or whose ankles are too conspicuous are taken to police stations to sign statements vowing to dress more modestly.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> In other countries, where there is more choice in the matter, the reasons for veiling are more complex. In Egypt&#8217;s socialist heyday, few wore the veil. In the 1970s and 1980s, as political Islam gained ground, many covered up as a sign of growing piety and conservatism. There were practical benefits too. Islamic garb enabled women to work alongside men without attracting opprobrium from strict male relatives. Something similar applies in provincial Turkey, where the scarf has made it easier for women to be active in public.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The hijab is now so popular, in many places where it is not compulsory, that it is no longer much of a political statement. In Egypt magazines such as <em>Hijab Fashion</em> have proliferated, along with shops selling bejewelled and beribboned scarves. In Cairo young women match the colour of their veils with that of their tunics, handbags, make-up and shoes. In Damascus they top fashionable outfits with tightly wound white scarves. Little flesh is on show, but the tight outfits suggest that not all veil-wearers are pious.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The niqab, though, remains controversial. Shortly before his recent death, Sayed Tantawi, who was Egypt&#8217;s senior Muslim cleric, told an 11-year-old girl to remove her niqab<em>,</em> saying it was not Islamic. Egypt&#8217;s leaders dislike the garment but have yet to outlaw it. Periodic bans in universities and government offices have been couched in the language of security.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Politics plays a role too. In Egypt those pushing for the niqab tend to be zealous Salafists, so pure that even the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt&#8217;s main Islamist opposition, is wary of them. Cracking down on the niqab may be a way for the government to muzzle one group of opponents. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Afghanistan is the only country where women wear the burqa in any great numbers. Some cast it off after the Taliban&#8217;s overthrow, but many more did not. Afghan feminists&#8212;and there are such brave souls&#8212;say challenging this may not be the most urgent task in a society where imposing change from outside can often backfire. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>They might be giants</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Emerging-market banks have raced ahead despite the financial crisis as their Western colleagues have languished. Patrick Foulis (interviewed ) asks how they will use their new-found strength</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ALONG the breezy three-kilometre stretch of Mumbai&#8217;s Marine Drive you pass cricket pitches, destitute people, luxury hotels, plump joggers and advertisements for Indian multinational companies, but almost no bank branches or cash machines. That absence, suggests O.P. Bhatt, chairman of State Bank of India, the country&#8217;s biggest lender, gives the visitor a hint of the potential for the banking industry. Marine Drive has been underbanked since it was built in the 1930s. But now there is a palpable sense in India, as in most other emerging economies, that banking is thriving&#8212;just as it has fallen into disrepute in many Western countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The emerging world has a history of volatility and of bad-debt problems&#8212;indeed China is grappling with such a problem at the moment. But developing-country banks now have got things right on a number of fronts. Anti-poverty campaigners can admire their efforts to offer banking services to the illiterate. Technology gurus can see new mobile applications and low-cost IT platforms, and industrialists can count on banks that actually want to lend to their firms. Regulation buffs see an industry that is both armour-plated and wrapped in cotton wool after the crises of the late 1990s and early 2000s. In most emerging economies banks are viewed as engines of development rather than as rent-seeking parasites.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But it is by the hard stuff, money, that banks in the developing world now measure up. Not only are they well capitalised and well funded, they are really big&#8212;and are enjoying rapid growth. By profits, Tier-1 capital, dividends and market value they now account for a quarter to half of the global banking industry. China&#8217;s lenders head the list of banks by market value, and Brazilian and Russian banks are among the world&#8217;s top 25. At current growth rates India&#8217;s banks will catch up in a decade. The crisis in Western banking, still reverberating in southern Europe, seems to have accelerated the shift in banking muscle from rich countries to the developing world.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This special report will argue that most of that muscle will be needed at home. To support the fast credit growth their populations and politicians demand, and the bad debts it may cause, emerging-market banks will need more capital than they can generate from retained profits. They are the pre-eminent gatherers of savings in the world, a mirror image of Western banks that became huge borrowers. But they will struggle to use those excess deposits abroad without taking dangerous currency risks, so the job of recycling excess savings abroad will remain with central banks and sovereign-wealth funds. The managers of emerging-market banks have plenty to do as it is. Some of them already run organisations that are far bigger than the biggest Western banks. Most also expect to lose corporate customers to local bond markets and to have to build up their consumer- and investment-banking operations to compensate. Many, too, are finding innovative ways to offer banking services to poor people without losing money.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If the crisis has transformed the status of emerging-market banks, it has also transformed the role of the state in banking. In China, which had been relaxing its grip on the industry for a decade, the government directed the banks to continue lending during 2008 and 2009&#8212;the main reason why the economy continued to grow fast. In Brazil, India and Russia the state banks have seen a sharp improvement in their fortunes, gaining market share at the expense of private banks. Some Western banks operating in developing countries have lived up to their reputation as unreliable partners. That is likely to have long-term consequences. The banking system most emerging economies now want is a mix of entrepreneurial private firms and state banks, with a few well-run foreign ones to keep the locals honest. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That has big implications for the long list of Western firms desperate to gain more exposure to emerging economies. The crisis has underscored the attractions of two business models. The network banks, such as Citigroup or HSBC, have a presence in lots of countries to make life easier for their customers. The &#8220;gone native&#8221; ones, such as Santander, have big retail operations with large market shares in just a few countries where they act like, and by and large are treated as, local firms. Both these models involve gathering deposits and operating branches on a large scale. The big investment banks are also active in emerging economies but may find the going increasingly tough as local banks get better.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Both those models are almost impossible to replicate now. The network banks are the products of a century of expansion. They are sufficiently entrenched for Citigroup&#8217;s near-collapse in New York, for instance, to cause minimal damage to its emerging-market business. The &#8220;gone native&#8221; banks seized unique opportunities in the 1990s and early 2000s as Latin America sold off banks after bad-debt crises and eastern Europe privatised after communism&#8217;s fall. No such sell-off looks remotely likely soon in China, India or Russia. Even the traditional last-resort technique for banks that want to become more international&#8212;setting up a few branches overseas and borrowing from headquarters or wholesale markets to fund lending there&#8212;has become much harder as regulators are clamping down on it.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The difficulty is mutual</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The only consolation for Western firms that cannot get in is that emerging-market banks are facing exactly the same set of problems as they try to expand abroad. For them the crisis came too soon. With another decade under their belt they might have had the size, excess capital and skills to seize the moment and buy big bombed-out banks at the peak of the crisis. As it is, most are having to embrace gradualist strategies. All are building &#8220;strings of pearls&#8221;&#8212;branches in big partner countries to help service customers at home. Some are also offering banking services to diaspora populations in rich countries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Western banks have found that establishing a light presence in lots of countries is a great way to lose money. The same is likely to be true for emerging-market banks, so the smarter firms are trying to develop a competitive advantage that they can export. For the Indians that may be low-cost technology; for the Brazilians, investment-banking savvy. Some of the biggest emerging-market banks are experimenting with small acquisitions in their &#8220;near abroad&#8221;. Going global requires the successful integration of lots of acquisitions, which Western banks have found hard to do.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This special report will show that the globalisation of banking, which has driven the industry for two decades, is in many ways on hold. If emerging economies are much more sceptical about unfettered finance and the role of foreign banks, Western societies are much more hostile to banks in general, let alone those run by foreigners or, worse still, foreign governments. Although emerging-market banks have far healthier business models than Western firms do, many of them will face a difficult trade-off. They will need access to foreign countries in order to build the sort of large-scale operations that make money. To get it, they may have to show that they are at arm&#8217;s length, or even entirely detached, from their governments. Yet the crisis has pushed most banks in the developing world the other way. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These banks have been pitched into the big league rather suddenly, helped by the woes of Western banks and the continued strong growth in their own economies. It seems inevitable that Mumbai&#8217;s Marine Drive will soon be decked with ATM machines, its joggers will be stabbing mobile-banking screens, the firms on the billboards will be going on buying sprees overseas and even the destitute will have some access to finance. Whether emerging-market banks will soon punch their weight in global banking, let alone dominate it, is another question. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>The developing world&#8217;s banks are flourishing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THERE is only one thing that is still small about banks in emerging economies: their bosses&#8217; pay packets. The head of China&#8217;s ICBC, the world&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, received just under $134,000 in 2009, a couple of decimal places shy of his Western counterparts. On all other measures these firms are big enough to make a Wall Street banker reconsider his status in the universe. In terms of market value they now account for almost half the industry&#8217;s total worldwide, nearly twice as much as in 2005. That might reflect an excess of optimism, but emerging-market banks are big by other measures too. According to Tab Bowers, a consultant at McKinsey, they account for about a third of the industry&#8217;s global revenues, matching the emerging countries&#8217; share of world GDP. By the most solid measures of all, profits, dividends and Tier-1 capital, listed banks domiciled in emerging markets now account for between 27% and 53% of the global industry (see chart 1). China is responsible for about half of this share. Big Western banks&#8217; profits from developing countries add up to perhaps a quarter of the local firms&#8217;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Despite their large size, most emerging-market banks are not household names in the West. Most rich-world investors are aware of China&#8217;s &#8220;big three&#8221; banks, at or near the top of the global rankings (see table 2), but know little about them. Aside from the Chinese banks, the global top 25 include a handful of big Russian and Brazilian firms, and lower down there is a long list of smaller banks that together add up to quite a lot. The average listed rich-country bank in the top 150 has a market value of about $36 billion, against $24 billion for emerging-market firms and just $15 billion if China is excluded. Many are state-controlled and most were handsomely profitable through the crisis and have good capital and funding profiles. Few have much business overseas. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The numbers game</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>League tables in banking are dangerous things. In 1990 all ten of the world&#8217;s largest banks by assets were either Japanese or French. Such things can change quickly. The big emerging-market banks should therefore view their rise with a mixture of pride and nervousness. China&#8217;s biggest banks are all still state-controlled. <strong>ICBC</strong>, spun out of the People&#8217;s Bank of China in 1984, is run by Jiang Jianqing, a career banker. It has been making a flurry of investments in Asia and Africa. <strong>China Construction Bank</strong> (CCB) has its roots in development banking. Its boss is Guo Shuqing, who ran China&#8217;s foreign-exchange fund before taking CCB public in 2005 in the first big bank flotation. <strong>Bank of China</strong> has a grand pedigree dating back to 1912. Traditionally China&#8217;s foreign-exchange and trade bank, it still has the largest presence abroad. <strong>Bank of Communications</strong> is the only Shanghai-based big firm, in which HSBC holds a 19% share.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Brazil&#8217;s two big private banks are widely admired. <strong>Ita\xFA Unibanco</strong> was formed through a merger in 2008 which saw it overtake <strong>Bradesco</strong> by size. Both firms are battle-hardened survivors and have big insurance, credit-card and investment-banking operations. Listed but state-controlled, <strong>Banco do Brazil </strong>is the country&#8217;s biggest financial firm, with a fifth of total assets. It has increased its market share since 2007 and is looking abroad. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Russia&#8217;s banking system is fragmented, with only two giant firms, both state-controlled. <strong>Sberbank</strong> controls almost a third of the country&#8217;s deposits and has a mixed loan book. Its newish management is trying to cut costs and spruce up its business at home. <strong>VTB Bank</strong> started as a merchant bank but has gradually built up its branch presence. About a quarter of its profits now come from retail banking.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>India&#8217;s banking system is small but growing fast. About three-quarters of the industry is in government hands, with the listed but state-controlled <strong>State Bank of India</strong> commanding about a quarter of the market. It has been revived under the watch of O.P. Bhatt, who became chairman in 2006. <strong>ICICI Bank</strong>, for a long time the pin-up of the private banks, paused for breath in 2009, rejigging its strategy to target industry as well as India&#8217;s burgeoning middle classes. Its veteran boss, K.V. Kamath, became chairman in 2009, with Chanda Kochhar taking over as chief executive. <strong>HDFC Bank</strong> is still a tiddler by assets but its market value has shot up, reflecting confidence in its domestic strategy and its combative chief executive, Aditya Puri. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Singapore, Turkey and South Korea also have banks with market values in the $20 billion range. But perhaps the most notable firm outside the BRIC group of countries is <strong>Standard Bank</strong> of South Africa, run by Jacko Maree since 1999. Almost a quarter of its profits come from outside its domestic market, mainly the rest of Africa. It got a big boost in 2007 when ICBC bought a 20% stake. A takeover, both parties say, is not on the cards, but Mr Maree&#8217;s business cards are now in both English and Chinese.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Just how big could such emerging-market banks get? Any self-respecting bank bull likes to whip out a chart comparing the ratio of bank loans with GDP in poor and rich countries. The poor countries generally have much lower ratios. The hope is that emerging-market banks will enjoy a double benefit. Not only will their economies grow fast but financial activity will become more intense, allowing banks to grow faster than GDP. Today quite a few banks in Asia, Africa and Latin America forecast that their loan books will rise by 20-30% annually over the next few years. Assuming that Western banks stagnate, that would mean China&#8217;s biggest bank would take about two years to reach the size of, say, JPMorgan Chase, measured by risk-adjusted assets. The biggest banks in Brazil, Russia and India will take seven to ten years. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The idea that banks are &#8220;GDP-plus&#8221; businesses has obvious pitfalls. In 2008 and 2009 the loan books of emerging-market banks outside China grew relatively slowly, at about 10%, although in China they expanded by about 30%, and the pace elsewhere will pick up this year. And if credit grows too quickly for too long the system tends to explode, as America and some other Western countries have found. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In central and eastern Europe too, where loans rose at twice the rate of nominal GDP between 2000 and 2007, they hit a brick wall in 2008 as overextended banks ran out of funding and bad debts mounted. In much poorer Nigeria, talked up in 2006 by Mayfair hedge-fund managers as the next great &#8220;frontier&#8221; banking market, credit as a share of GDP doubled in about three years to around 30%. With small branch networks and relatively few people in the formal economy, this was too much. About a third of the system by assets is now distressed. The lesson from the Asian crisis of the late 1990s is that systems generally shrink after a blow-up. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Credit relative to GDP, then, does not grow in a straight line, thanks to the economic cycle. But even in the longer term a rising trend is not inevitable. According to Credit Suisse, domestic credit to the private sector credit relative to the economy has been flat or falling between 2002 and 2008 in China, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. And even if borrowing levels are rising in the longer term, banks&#8217; role in supplying that credit is not assured. In America much of the work of financing companies is done through capital markets. Emerging-market banks may face a similar trend. Except in Brazil, most of their business consists of loans to industry. Fast-growing local capital markets could take some of this away. If so, the biggest part of the banks&#8217; balance-sheets would actually shrink relative to GDP.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Penetrating arguments</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet for all the caveats, emerging-market banks can count on vast untapped demand. McKinsey estimates that most people in Latin America, Asia and Africa lack access to formal banking services. Slowly the supply is catching up. Bradesco in Brazil has recently opened the world&#8217;s first floating bank branch (which sails down the Solim\xF5es River in Amazonas) and the first branch in Heli\xF3polis, a big <em>favela</em> (slum) in S\xE3o Paulo. State Bank of India has more than doubled its number of ATMs since March 2008 without seeing a decline in transactions per machine per day, currently about 300. Most banks are trying to reach the &#8220;unbanked&#8221;. This is partly a question of technology&#8212;for example, providing biometric identity cards for illiterate people without papers. It is also a question of organisation. Mr Kamath, the chairman of ICICI, India&#8217;s biggest private bank, is thinking about appointing an agent in each village who would be given the kit to link up with the bank&#8217;s system. Indian government schemes to guarantee work for rural workers for 100 days a year and to introduce identification cards for all could be a catalyst for the spread of such schemes. Like most bank executives, Mr Kamath accepts that these will not make the industry money &#8220;for quite some time&#8221; but reckons that &#8220;no bank can afford not to be there.&#8221; Mr Puri, the boss of rival HDFC Bank, says that on a &#8220;five-year horizon it can absolutely move the needle&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the real boon for many emerging-market banks has been the rise of a credit culture among the middle classes. Well-off people behave in a way their parents would find unimaginable, buying homes and cars not by saving up but by borrowing. The ratio of household borrowing to GDP points to this in all big developing countries (see chart 3). If the world economy rebalances so that surplus countries save less and consume more, mortgages and consumer loans will become the banks&#8217; biggest source of profits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although competition may put pressure on emerging-market banks&#8217; high margins, there are offsetting factors. People will shift their savings from deposits to investment products with better yields that banks can charge fees for. Low-cost technology too could boost profits. India&#8217;s banks say they have leapfrogged the expensive mainframe computers of their Western peers and expect a rapid move towards mobile-phone banking among the young. In China people do not use cheques but can get text-message confirmations when they have used their credit cards, reducing the risk of fraud. Noel Gordon, a consultant at Accenture, jokes that when Western banks were fiddling with rocket-science finance, emerging-market banks were innovating more productively by opening up entire new markets that will make sustainable profits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Emerging-market companies also promise to give the banks lots of new business. This year there will be a boom in loans as they shrug off the downturn. In the longer term banks will have to adapt as local capital markets develop and businesses expand abroad. Most lenders are building up investment-banking skills and a presence overseas that will generate income as more local businesses turn to issuing bonds and shares for finance. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And even though all these opportunities still lie ahead, emerging-market banks have already taken a giant leap in size and profits in the past decade. They have also maintained adequate capital ratios and ample deposit funding. The combination of growth and strength would appear to give them enormous advantages, heralding a rebalancing of power in global finance. Yet are those rock-solid balance-sheets quite what they seem? </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Rambo in cuffs</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Balance-sheets are less powerful than they look</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WESTERN bank bosses often suspend their critical faculties when discussing their emerging-market peers. Suddenly it is not the next quarter that matters but the long-term flow of world historical forces. &#8220;They think about time in a very different way,&#8221; says one, Zen-like, before adding: &#8220;History always follows a course.&#8221; What lies behind this mumbo-jumbo is the recognition that emerging-market banks are not just getting bigger but also have piles of excess deposits because they are based in countries with high levels of savings. This would appear to give them a decisive advantage over Western banks that rely on fickle borrowing markets to do business. To add to rich-world banks&#8217; discomfort, developing-world banks tend to have high capital ratios too. In banking, especially after the crisis, whoever has the deposits and the capital usually wins. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The reality is a bit more complicated than that. Banks are indeed mirrors of the economy, so banks&#8217; balance-sheets reflect the fact that the typical Westerner is a borrower and the typical Asian a saver. Emerging-market banks tend to have vast branch networks that suck in deposits from thrifty families and companies. Only some of these get lent out again. Banks park the surplus with the state, by buying government bonds or keeping it in central banks. The state in turn acts as the international recycling agent for those excess savings: it lends them to Western countries through its foreign reserves or through a sovereign-wealth fund, for example by buying US Treasuries, mortgage bonds or money-market instruments. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Overextended Western banks do the exact opposite: they borrow from capital markets to plug the hole created by having more loans than deposits. This shows up in the ratio of loans to deposits, which for rich-country banks rose to alarming heights in the run-up to the crisis (though they have since come down somewhat), whereas those for emerging-market banks remained healthier. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another way of measuring the differences is to look at the absolute funding gaps. Although by and large rich and poor countries&#8217; banks are not lending to, or borrowing from, each other directly, there is a symmetry to the figures that is not entirely coincidental. In 2008 the surplus of customer deposits over loans (ie, excess savings) at listed emerging-markets banks was about $1.6 trillion, compared with a deficit of about $1.9 trillion at rich-world banks (see chart 4). The imbalances of the world&#8217;s economies are reflected by their banks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A Western bank with masses of excess funding would be deemed to have a huge competitive advantage. Surely the same applies to entire countries&#8217; banking systems? Emerging-market banks could use their surplus funds beyond their borders, for example by lending directly to foreigners and taking market share from rich-country firms. By doing so they would be bypassing central banks and sovereign-wealth funds, recycling excess savings directly themselves. But this is not what happens. For a start, the funding position of emerging-market banks is less impressive if China is excluded. And even in markets with excess savings these are not always evenly distributed, with a lot of them stuck in sleepy state banks. Some firms are doing their best to change that: ICICI&#8217;s Ms Kochhar, for example, is setting up lots of new branches to boost its deposits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Banks that do gather excess deposits may find the government wants to get its hands on them. This could be for prudential reasons. For example, China&#8217;s regulator requires banks to keep 17% of their deposits with the central bank and tinkers with this ratio to control the economy. Or it could be because the government needs the cash. In India banks are obliged to use about a quarter of their deposits to buy government debt, which helps the government fund its budget deficit. Mr Bhatt of State Bank of India says there is little chance that this will change soon: &#8220;It is the model in this country,&#8221; and allows the government to spend on development. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>So complementary and yet so far</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But suppose that when everything is said and done banks still have piles of excess deposits? This is broadly true of China&#8217;s lenders. Can they find a way to marry their savings-rich firms with the indebted equivalents of the West? There is already a real-life case study: HSBC. It has always gathered more deposits in Hong Kong than it lends out. In 2002 it bought a mirror image of itself, Household, an American consumer-finance firm with $106 billion of loans and no deposits. It announced at the time that it was &#8220;bringing together one of the world&#8217;s top asset-generators with one of the world&#8217;s top deposit-gatherers&#8221;. Those labels could be applied respectively to America&#8217;s and greater China&#8217;s entire banking systems. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The acquisition failed because of bad debts at Household, but the original premise was wrong too. HSBC&#8217;s regulators, like most around the world, did not want deposits in one country to be used to finance a subsidiary overseas, exposing the bank to foreign-exchange and counterparty risk. Michael Geoghegan, HSBC&#8217;s chief executive, says it might have found fiddly ways of getting Asian customers to fund Household, perhaps by securitising Household&#8217;s loans and selling them to HSBC&#8217;s Hong Kong subsidiary; but the bank chose not to do so because it felt that would disadvantage its Hong Kong depositors. He says the regulatory climate has got more difficult since the crisis, and &#8220;it&#8217;s getting harder to move liquidity around&#8221; among subsidiaries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For the moment China&#8217;s banks show little appetite for taking positions in risky Western assets. Bank of China did boost its foreign-currency lending in 2009 by a stonking 47% to about $200 billion, or about a quarter of its loan book, but this was matched by $190-odd billion of foreign-currency deposits. The bank actually reduced its holdings of foreign-currency securities by an eighth, &#8220;in accordance with the global financial-market situation&#8221;&#8212;a polite way of saying in order to avoid dud Western assets. Its latest annual report notes &#8220;growing concerns&#8221; over the finances of southern European banks and governments.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Deposits don&#8217;t travel</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are other ways of utilising excess deposits abroad, says Anthony Stevens, a consultant at Oliver Wyman. The most obvious ones are hedging, organising swap lines with foreign banks and encouraging domestic customers to switch their deposits into foreign currency, thereby making them take the exchange-rate risk. But none of these are large-scale options in countries with partially closed capital accounts. And in China in particular, given the undervaluation of the renminbi, the last thing policymakers want is banks whose asset bases would fall as the currency appreciated. Far better for the currency risk to be borne by the central bank and sovereign-wealth funds. In the medium term, as customers spend more and save less, the pool of excess cash in emerging-market banks may shrink. Until then it will be hard to use that strength abroad.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What about the emerging-market banks&#8217; capital positions? At the end of 2009 these banks had a weighted-average Tier-1 capital ratio of 10%, in line with rich-world banks, but this probably understates their advantage. Excluding China&#8217;s banks (which have been busy raising equity since), the ratio was 12%. And the new capital rules known as &#8220;Basel 3&#8221; are likely to be much less painful for emerging-market banks, which typically have higher-quality capital and smaller investment-banking units (which will be heavily penalised by the new rules) than their rich-world peers. At the same time they are likely to be more profitable than banks in Europe and America, which will allow them to create new capital faster.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even so, emerging-market banks will still be short of capital. That is partly because of bad debts. In most places the cycle has already turned for the better. In Brazil Bradesco has said that the worst is over. Sizwe Nxasana, chief executive of FirstRand, one of South Africa&#8217;s big four banks, notes that impairments are falling off and the performance of loans to lower-income customers has been &#8220;very good&#8221; during the downturn. But in both India and China the position is less clear-cut. Indian banks have lowish levels of non-performing loans but have built up relatively small reserves against them. These reserves act as a buffer against losses before capital is eaten into. Adjusting for that could knock a percentage point or so off Indian banks&#8217; capital ratios. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China&#8217;s banks seem to have lots of reserves relative to the current level of non-performing loans, but that level seems implausibly low given how much they have been lending. Bad-debt reserves relative to the size of total loans are smaller, especially compared with Western firms that have taken massive hits in anticipation of losses. For example, Bank of China has roughly the same size of loan book as JPMorgan Chase or Citigroup, but only around half the level of bad-debt reserves.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, assume the best: that after a lending boom of several years, bad debts at emerging-market banks are under control. Surely, then, with their high profitability, they should be throwing off plenty of excess capital? Not necessarily, for the faster they grow, the more capital they will need to set aside to support new loans. And although emerging-market banks generate decent returns on equity, in aggregate they pay out about a third of that in dividends, limiting the amount that is retained and added to their capital bases. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Less than meets the eye</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The maths of this can be pretty eye-watering. Assume that emerging-market banks really increased their risk-adjusted assets at, say, 20% a year yet maintained the same return on those assets, capital ratios and dividend payout ratios as they had last year. To back new assets, such as loans, they would need $4 trillion of new capital over the next ten years, only $2.6 trillion of which would come from retained profits. They would need to raise $1.4 trillion from external sources&#8212;about one-and-a-half times the total capital America&#8217;s 19 biggest banks had at the end of 2008. Even assuming growth of 15%, the shortfall would be some $400 billion. One option would be to cut dividends, but neither private nor public shareholders would like that.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At the same time Western banks are actually likely to release capital as they wind down bad assets. Royal Bank of Scotland has about $30 billion tied up in its &#8220;bad bank&#8221; but will probably have to use that to repay emergency aid from the state, its current majority owner. Still, banks that have either largely paid back the government, such as Citi, or never accepted aid, such as HSBC, could eventually have capital coming out of their ears. Vikram Pandit, Citi&#8217;s boss, recently told investors that &#8220;nobody wants to talk about excess capital,&#8221; but &#8220;at some point down the road we&#8217;re going to have to figure out what to do with&#8221; it.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The balance-sheets of emerging-market and rich-world banks are like the coasts of America and Africa: they look like a good fit. One group of lenders is overloaded with excess deposits but in need of capital, the other is short of deposits but likely to generate capital. It would seem like a template for much closer integration, but bringing the two groups of banks together might be as difficult as melding continents. That partly reflects the problems emerging-market banks face in shifting excess funds into foreign-currency assets, or among subsidiaries in different countries. But most emerging economies now also have less appetite than they did for letting foreigners in, and much more for state involvement in banking. And far from being ready to take on the globe, most emerging-market bankers are consumed by their colossal and growing businesses at home. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Domestic duties</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>CCB, China&#8217;s second-biggest bank, exemplifies the size of the task at home</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS something of a surprise to find that the bank boss with the best line in deadpan humour is Guo Shuqing, chairman of China Construction Bank (CCB). When it floated in Hong Kong in 2005 Mr Guo reminded the assembled ranks of slick investment bankers and analysts that during the Cultural Revolution he had been a cowboy. Five years on the bank has risen to be the world&#8217;s second-largest by market value, after ICBC. Over that period its profits have more than doubled to $16 billion, more than at any of America&#8217;s three most profitable banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CCB embodies the paradox of many emerging-market banks. It is huge and has grown phenomenally quickly, but the demands placed on it at home are also huge. Last year it expanded its loan book by 27%. The industry as a whole grew even faster, by 32%, partly thanks to the leading role the banks played in the government&#8217;s economic stimulus. New loans made in China were equivalent to almost a third of GDP. Roy Ramos, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, points out that in less than ten months China added the equivalent of India&#8217;s banking industry twice over.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The government is now working hard to ensure that the lending spree does not cause a bad-debt problem that infects the banks (which it had to recapitalise just under a decade ago). In April Liu Mingkang, the top banking regulator, said he had asked the banks to submit &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; reviews of their loan books by June. Of particular concern are the infrastructure projects backed by local governments, which accounted for perhaps a third of the new loans. These projects often suffer from poor cashflow, no explicit guarantee from the state and limited transparency.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Guo is optimistic about bad debts in the banking system overall. &#8220;If we deal cautiously with this risk we will have a soft landing,&#8221; he says. However, he also cautions that there is no blanket guarantee for local infrastructure projects: &#8220;Not all can be rescued by the central government.&#8221; The key, he reckons, is to improve the flow of cash to local authorities, which itself requires further reforms. The cap on the amount of bonds the central government issues on their behalf needs to be raised. But China also needs to &#8220;open the front door&#8221; by allowing local governments to raise municipal bonds. At the same time the government can enlist the help of China&#8217;s remaining fully state-owned banks, although their role needs to be defined clearly to avoid moral hazard. The same goes for the plethora of smaller local banks that can be encouraged to provide more credit to local projects but must, he says, remain &#8220;independent institutions&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Hungry for capital</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China&#8217;s banks are highly profitable, which gives them a buffer to absorb potential losses. Still, in response to the rapid growth in loans and the risk of bad debts, the banks are also busy raising capital. Bank of China, Bank of Communications and ICBC have indicated that between them they will issue up to $28 billion-worth of new securities, bolstering their core capital by about a seventh. CCB has yet to finalise its plans but it is likely to issue new equity too. Agricultural Bank of China, a giant fully state-owned lender, is considering floating a minority of its shares on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stockmarkets this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China&#8217;s banks have a lot on their plates right now, thanks to the lending surge of the past two years. But even in the medium term the industry is likely to be quite a challenge to manage. Part of this relates to capital. This year, for example, the government is still aiming for lending growth of about 19%. At the same time China&#8217;s banks are paying hefty dividends, limiting the amount of capital they generate internally. Mr Guo at CCB, which paid out 44% of profits last year, explains that &#8220;according to international practice the ratio should be about 30%.&#8221; But an absolute dividend cut is unlikely because Huijin, the state vehicle that owns stakes in the banks, needs the income to pay interest on the funds it spent recapitalising China&#8217;s banks back in 2003. Although the planned capital-raising may dilute Huijin&#8217;s stake, currently at 57%, the government has &#8220;got some room&#8221;, Mr Guo says, to maintain a majority shareholding.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other banks agree that more capital will be required over time. Yang Kaisheng, the president of ICBC, said recently that the big four banks could need $70 billion of outside capital over the next five years&#8212;about double the maximum they have indicated they might raise now. This was assuming loan growth of 15% a year. At some point the state will need to inject more capital into the banks or permit them to cut their dividend payouts. The third option, of allowing its stake to be diluted below 50%, looks unlikely, and the fourth, of developing a shadow banking system into which the banks can offload assets, seems less attractive after the debacle in America&#8217;s securitisation markets.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is not just the capital bases of China&#8217;s banks that will have to adapt to continued expansion. The system already has all the regional complexity of America, from Hainan Island, a Florida-style property-development hotspot, to pockets of conservatism such as Zhejiang Province, just south of Shanghai. And notwithstanding the heavy infrastructure lending of the past two years, the mix of the banks&#8217; lending will shift. Today only a fifth of all loans are to households. But as saving declines, consumer lending, including mortgages, will become more important. At the same time rapidly developing capital markets will offer big companies an alternative way to raise money and put pressure on banks&#8217; lending margins. Mr Guo reckons that lending to consumers and small firms could rise to 40% of CCB&#8217;s loan book within five years, from about a quarter today.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If China&#8217;s banking system and its capital markets develop as planned, it will be one of the biggest and fastest financial transformations ever seen. If they do not, the result may be one of the world&#8217;s bigger financial headaches. There is little inclination to allow a sudden influx of foreign banks that might make the system less stable. Chinese banking has interacted with the outside world cautiously, lagging the expansion of China&#8217;s big industrial firms. Bank of China last year generated 22% of its pre-tax profits outside mainland China but most of this was from Hong Kong and Macau. ICBC, which has shown the most expansionist instincts, derived only 4% of profits from abroad.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>No adventures</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Guo, for his part, advocates caution abroad. Using domestic deposits to fund purchases of foreign assets involves too much risk: &#8220;If the currency were to appreciate, how would we pay it back?&#8221; CCB made 1% of its profits from abroad last year but the idea of boosting this by buying equity stakes in foreign banks is not enticing: &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to do that very much&#8230;we want to establish a network abroad for our customers but their requirements are limited.&#8221; Mr Guo says Western politicians and regulators have been &#8220;very nervous&#8221; about Chinese lenders taking big stakes in their banks, but adds that the crisis may have changed this a little. In any case, Western economies are overbanked, suggesting limited growth potential. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In mirror image, the influence of foreign firms in China is likely to be limited. Western banks, Mr Guo says, &#8220;don&#8217;t have many opportunities&#8221; to build enough branches to rival the vast networks of the big domestic banks. Through their minority stakes in Chinese banks Western firms get all the exposure to China they need.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In some respects China&#8217;s template for banking seems rather conservative. It envisages a stable industry structure, with limited entry for Western newcomers, a high degree of government co-ordination and a cautious view of banks going abroad. Yet at the same time it is dynamic, with vigorous competition among domestic banks, big shifts in the pattern of lending, plenty of product innovation and, most important of all, fast credit growth. This kind of &#8220;managed finance&#8221; model is no longer confined to China. Since the crisis a milder version of it has gained fans all over the emerging world. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Mutually assured existence</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Public and private banks have reached a modus vivendi</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;INDIA is where China was ten years back,&#8221; says Mr Kamath, chairman of ICICI. That is certainly true by size. India&#8217;s GDP amounts to about a quarter of China&#8217;s today and its banking industry just a tenth. But in at least one respect India is well ahead: it has several dynamic privately owned banks that over the past decade have taken a fifth or so of the market from the state-controlled banks. Until the financial crisis in the West the private banks seemed to offer a template for the entire industry: within a decade or two, it seemed, the state would retreat significantly. Now India&#8217;s mixed model of banking is likely to persist for longer.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Part of that reflects the fact that India had its own wobble during 2008. This was not a full-blown crisis; indeed, Aditya Puri, chief executive of HDFC Bank, the second-biggest (and perkiest) private firm, says to describe it that way would be an &#8220;appalling misconception&#8221;. But there was a sharp spike in money-market interest rates after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a liquidity squeeze and a notable shift in deposits. At ICICI overall deposits, as well as the stickier category of savings and current-account deposits, dropped by about a tenth between June and December 2008. Savers shifted their cash to the government-controlled banks, which were perceived to be safer. &#8220;Money was pouring out of our ears,&#8221; says Mr Bhatt of State Bank of India.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That experience has helped prompt a change of strategy at ICICI, which for a long time was one of the most admired private banks in the developing world. After a decade of spectacular growth, fuelled in part by wholesale funding (including bulk deposits), the bank recently slammed on the brakes. In 2009 its loan book shrank by 17%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chanda Kochhar (one of several female bank bosses in India), who took over as chief executive from Mr Kamath last year, says that the bank decided to focus on changing its funding mix towards retail deposits because as interest rates rise these should be cheaper as well as stickier than wholesale funds. Current and savings deposits now make up 42% of total deposits, up from 27% before the crisis. Private banks so far lack the state banks&#8217; huge branch networks, but they are working on it. ICICI now has 2,000 branches, against only 755 in early 2007. That should help it suck in more deposits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The state banks may hold on for a while yet to the market share they have taken. Between June 2007 and December 2009, after a long period of genteel decline, they saw their share of total deposits and loans rise from 73% to 77%. After years of fierce competition from the private banks, they have begun to get their act together. At State Bank of India&#8217;s headquarters in Mumbai visitors may still receive a smart salute from a man in uniform, but, Mr Bhatt says, its technology and products are now &#8220;comparable to the private sector&#8221;. Mr Kamath agrees that the state banks have caught up on technology.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Learning to love state banks</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet even if the private banks do go back on the attack, attitudes towards the state-controlled banks have changed for good. After all, they were the ones that continued to supply credit to the economy during the downturn. Before the crisis all banks were expanding their loan books at an annual rate of about 25% (see chart 6). After mid-2008 there was a big divergence, with the state banks (which come in three main flavours: the nationalised banks, State Bank of India and the regional rural banks) keeping credit growing fairly steadily. The private banks more or less ground to a halt. The foreign banks went from expansion to sharp decline, with their share of loans dropping from a peak of 7% to a paltry 5.3% last December. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most bank executives now also concede that old-fashioned regulation was shown to have its merits. Indian banks are required to hold a big slug of their assets (typically just under a third) in government bonds and at the central bank. Now Western regulators too are considering pushing up liquidity levels. Indian bankers joke that all the fiddly rules they face have become the envy of regulators throughout the world.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All this has led to a reappraisal of whether state banks should be fully privatised in the long term. HDFC Bank&#8217;s Mr Puri says that &#8220;the world has changed and the view around here has changed.&#8221; Mr Kamath takes a similar view, predicting that in the new circumstances &#8220;India&#8217;s evolution will be more or less in line with China&#8217;s.&#8221; Mr Bhatt reckons there will be &#8220;no big-bang reform&#8221; and that over time the state-controlled banks&#8217; share will drop only gently, to 55-65% of the market.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A similar message is heard in Brazil. In the past five years Brazilian private banks have risen to global significance, helped by a frenetic 2007 and 2008 when an eighth of the system&#8217;s assets changed hands. Ita\xFA bought Unibanco and Santander bought ABN AMRO&#8217;s Brazilian business. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But just as important has been the expansion of the state banks, Banco do Brasil (a listed commercial lender with a bias towards agriculture), Caixa Econ\xF4mica Federal (a mortgage specialist) and BNDES (which acts more as an investment company). Together their share of the financial system&#8217;s assets has reversed its earlier decline and now stands at 42% (see chart 7). Part of their increase in market share reflects acquisitions, with Banco do Brasil buying Nossa Caixa, a mid-sized state-owned firm, in 2008 and a 50% stake in Votorantim, a car-finance specialist, in 2009. But about two-thirds of the rise has come from lending more than the private firms during the downturn.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That in turn has changed people&#8217;s views of a mixed financial system. Domingos Abreu, chief financial officer of Bradesco, says the state banks &#8220;had a very important role&#8230;in the government&#8217;s anticyclical policies&#8221;, adding that in a downturn &#8220;it makes a difference&#8221; to have a mixture of state, private and foreign banks. He concedes that two years ago he might have answered the question differently, but now he had to acknowledge that the state banks have their merits. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Alfredo S\xE1enz, chief executive of Santander, which owns the country&#8217;s third-biggest private lender, quips that Brazil keeps an &#8220;artistic equilibrium&#8221; between the private and the public sectors. Persio Arida, a former governor of the central bank and president of BNDES, and now a partner at BTG Pactual, Brazil&#8217;s leading independent investment bank, says that the &#8220;consensus&#8221; in the country is that the state banks played a vital role. However, he cautions that until the extent of bad debts created by their lending is known, no definitive judgment can be reached. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Russia holds the line</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Russia up to 54% of the system&#8217;s assets are state-controlled, according to Andrei Vernikov, an economist, compared with 45% in 2007. Foreign banks&#8217; share stands at 18%. The balance-sheets of the three European banks that are most active in Russia, UniCredit, Raiffeisen International and Soci\xE9t\xE9 G\xE9n\xE9rale, together shrank by about a quarter in euro terms in 2009. Royal Bank of Scotland&#8217;s loans to Russian corporate customers dropped by 45% in sterling terms. Net loans at state-controlled Sberbank and VTB declined by only 4% and 10% respectively in local-currency terms. Last summer the government took a larger stake in VTB to bring its holding up to 86%. Andrew Keeley, an analyst at Troika Dialog, an investment bank, says that although the government is likely to sell the additional stake in VTB again, it intends to keep majority control of both big banks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But none of this means that a Soviet-style banking system is about to emerge in any of these countries. In China the government did take control of credit during the crisis, but for other state banks it was more of a nudge and a wink. Mr Bhatt says he was left to his own devices. Most governments also want private-sector banks to raise the level of competition. Even in China the state accepts some innovative upstarts, such as China Merchants Bank, a mid-sized bank with diffuse ownership and no direct state control. And all emerging markets want some foreign banks in order to keep local firms on their toes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So although the ratio of ingredients varies, the objective mostly seems to be a mix with a strong state presence. This is seen as more responsive to businesses, less vulnerable to flaky foreigners and more open to &#8220;soft&#8221; control by the state as it tries to manage the economic cycle. Western bankers see its merits too: HSBC&#8217;s Mr Geoghegan, a veteran of banking in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, reckons that a healthy combination of foreign and local firms leaves foreign banks politically less exposed.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Control freaks</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The problem for state banks is that they need to find a way of raising capital without diluting the government&#8217;s holding. Most state-controlled banks are listed because a quotation brings market discipline to managers and provides useful information about the performance of the bank. But governments seem determined to hold on to a stake of at least 51%. For example, Banco do Brasil, now the country&#8217;s largest lender by assets, announced plans to raise $5 billion earlier this year, but its objective remains the &#8220;maintenance of the government&#8217;s shareholding control&#8221;. Turkey is thinking about floating its largest lender, Ziraat Bank, but the state seems likely to retain control. It is the same story in China, says Bill Stacey, an analyst at Aviate Global, a brokerage firm. The government is happy to sell shares in banks but wants to keep a majority stake. Likewise, in Russia the state wants to retain control of the two biggest banks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What happens when the state&#8217;s holding gets close to that crucial 50%? State Bank of India expects to receive a capital injection from the government this year. Its chairman, Mr Bhatt, says it is still an open question whether the state might breach the 50% threshold in the medium term, but even then it would seek to have a big enough stake to remain the dominant shareholder. Many governments are in better fiscal condition than India&#8217;s and have more scope to top up banks&#8217; capital. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Emerging-market banks&#8217; hunger for capital used to ensure that they would ultimately be sold off to the market&#8212;or to foreigners. Not any more. So the prospect now is of a fast-growing, innovative banking industry that remains subject to conservative regulation and only gradual shifts in control. After the West&#8217;s experience with no-holds-barred banking, that may be a good idea. But for growth-starved Western banks desperate to do business in emerging markets it means they will find it even harder to get in. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n "

    <h1>We lucky few</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>For Western firms the barriers to entry into emerging-market banking are daunting</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;YOU kind of needed to think about this 30 years ago,&#8221; says Stuart Gulliver, who runs HSBC&#8217;s investment bank, when asked about Western banks expanding in emerging markets. He has a point.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> There are only two kinds of Western banks that are big in developing countries, and both have been at it for quite a while. The first are the global network banks which have a limited presence in lots of countries which they use to tap internationally minded companies and consumers: Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered. The second are the lenders that have &#8220;gone native&#8221; with a deep retail presence, most notably Santander and BBVA in Latin America and UniCredit in eastern Europe. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These six firms certainly pack a punch, with nearly $30 billion of profits from developing countries in 2009 (see chart 8), about a quarter of what listed local banks made. But replicating the &#8220;gone native&#8221; banks has become next to impossible (see ). And even the network banks have historical advantages that make it hard to emulate them. By the end of the 19th century HSBC was already big in Asia and Standard Chartered&#8217;s predecessor firms were doing well in Africa and India. Citigroup&#8217;s main constituent part, International Banking Corporation, was founded in 1901. A year later, with an agent installed in China, it advised shareholders that &#8220;matters are progressing favourably in Shanghai&#8221;&#8212;a message banks still intone.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The network banks have been through a few twists and turns. For its first 85 years HSBC concentrated on Asia, although it retained a presence in London. From 1949 it adjusted to the revolution in China and consolidated in India, Hong Kong and the Middle East. After 1978 it started to expand mainly in rich countries, which led to the purchase of Britain&#8217;s Midland Bank in 1992 and the shift of its headquarters to London, and in 2003 to the ill-fated takeover of America&#8217;s Household. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Standard Chartered had a turbulent time from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with an expansion in America, a failed attempt to buy one British bank, a hostile bid from another, then the Asian crisis and a bout of boardroom bloodletting. Citigroup has spent the past decade trying to be a financial supermarket.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The crisis has cleared their minds. Citigroup, notes its Indian-born boss, Vikram Pandit, &#8220;is going back to the core model of what we had as a global bank&#8221;. After the bail-out Citi realised that &#8220;it was the emerging markets that made us very special,&#8221; he says, and that the dealmaking of the past decade had diverted a lot of energy away from the firm&#8217;s strengths. Shirish Apte and Stephen Bird, joint bosses of Citi&#8217;s business in Asia, say it has been largely untouched by the turmoil in New York. One rival in the region says Citi&#8217;s business is &#8220;brilliant&#8221;. That resilience has echoes in history. When President Roosevelt closed America&#8217;s banks in March 1933 to try to halt a meltdown, the bank&#8217;s overseas deposit base shrank by just 2%. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>America&#8217;s other large commercial banks came late to the party. Because of regulatory quirks most did not go overseas until the 1960s, and despite the huge advantage of their customer base at home few were able to maintain the global presence they had aspired to. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>HSBC&#8217;s Mr Geoghegan moved to Hong Kong in early 2010. His perks include a house on a leafy lane on top of the island and a huge office in one of the city&#8217;s most iconic buildings. He says emerging markets are about &#8220;volatility&#8221;, something only the biggest and most experienced firms can handle. HSBC&#8217;s rethink began in 2006 when it abandoned its efforts to turn its investment bank into a bulge-bracket contender and shifted its attention to developing economies. The blow-up at Household, which HSBC is now winding down, gave impetus to this move. After an $18 billion rights issue in 2009 it has landed on its feet. Its structure, with a surplus of deposits and its local operations ring-fenced as subsidiaries, is a regulator&#8217;s dream. And at a time when emerging countries increasingly do business with each other, being everywhere turns out to be pretty useful.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Standard Chartered has concentrated mainly on emerging markets for two decades but has recently changed its approach. When Mervyn Davies was chief executive in 2002, he said the consumer business would be &#8220;our engine for growth&#8221;. In fact the horsepower has come from wholesale banking, which now provides 80% of profits, up from 60% seven years ago. Peter Sands, who became chief executive in 2006, may have refined tastes&#8212;during an interview with your correspondent he received a note from his piano tuner&#8212;but his message to shareholders last year was anything but subtle: &#8220;Our role and position in the world of banks have changed dramatically. We did not just weather the crisis, we turned it to our advantage.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>When the network banks have strayed too far from their core businesses&#8212;for example in consumer finance&#8212;their record has been patchy. Their backbone is the international presence built up over decades and their relationship with corporate customers which is based, in an oft-repeated formulation, &#8220;more local than other international banks and more international than the local banks.&#8221; Although this is often mocked by rivals as a way of dressing up small market shares in many countries, the case for geographic reach is getting stronger as emerging markets trade more with each other and the number of multinational companies grows. Citigroup says clients that bank with it in 70 or more countries spend twice as much as those that bank with it in 50-60 countries. HSBC&#8217;s Mr Gulliver says that to win corporate customers in emerging markets, &#8220;you have to have a substantial presence in the developed world&#8221; and the ability to lend on a substantial scale&#8212;something few other firms can offer.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>In praise of plumbing</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All three banks also own bits of the global financial plumbing that governments, companies and other banks need to ship funds around the world. That gets a foot in clients&#8217; door and generates a slab of stable profits and deposits. Some other banks, including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and Royal Bank of Scotland, have big transaction-services divisions, but about half of their revenue comes from their home markets. In terms of profits from emerging markets, the three network banks&#8217; transaction-services units are much larger. Replicating Citi&#8217;s operation, Mr Pandit says, would be &#8220;a very, very difficult thing to do because you&#8217;ve got to follow the generational process&#8221; that saw the bank expand over a century.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Have the network banks been able to translate their unique advantages into profits? After all, ABN AMRO&#8217;s giant global presence became a liability when it produced too little revenue to cover its costs. That helps to explain why all three banks developed consumer-banking businesses. Citi has been trying to attract well-off retail customers since 1976, but has not always succeeded. Its Latin American credit-card business lost money last year and its credit-card loans of $18 billion in Asia generated profits of just $214m. Jonathan Larsen, who heads its consumer business in Asia, says bad debts are improving and Citi enjoys &#8220;an extraordinary brand awareness&#8221; that can be tapped. Urbanisation helps: the top 85 cities in emerging markets generate 10% of global GDP, so a small branch network can make a big difference. Mr Pandit says the business is there to stay.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>HSBC is sticking with well-off customers but has gone off mass-market consumer finance. Mr Geoghegan notes that in developing countries &#8220;it is quite easy to lend and much harder to collect.&#8221; Instead HSBC is bulking up, for example with a small deal in Indonesia recently that &#8220;solved our problem&#8221; of too few deposits. Critics point out that almost half the bank&#8217;s $11 billion of pre-tax profits from emerging markets in 2009 came from mature Hong Kong and $1.5 billion from minority stakes in Chinese firms. Yet many banks would love to be so well placed in China. In theory HSBC has the right to increase its stake in BoCom to 40% if regulators approve, but it is far from clear that they would. Mr Geoghegan says that HSBC has &#8220;chips on a number of different opportunities&#8221; in China and had never assumed that it might be able to gain control of a Chinese bank. Bank of Communications is currently raising capital, and HSBC is planning a Shanghai listing that could raise, say, $5 billion. Whatever the sum, say Mr Geoghegan, &#8220;the money will stay in China.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The time of Sands</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Both Citigroup and HSBC have tilted away from the rich world but their direction&#8212;consumer or corporate, China or the entire emerging world&#8212;remains in the balance. StanChart, for its part, has pushed the network model towards investment banking. Its success in Asia over the past three years raises big questions for the bulge-bracket firms. Mr Sands argues that the old paradigm&#8212;foreign banks with products and global reach on one side, local banks that have cosy relations with customers and regulators on the other&#8212;is no longer valid. A successful bank needs to have all of those things now. The importance of a local deposit base has also grown, partly for regulatory reasons and partly because customers want banks that can lend to them. Richard Meddings, StanChart&#8217;s finance director, says the base of branches has created a &#8220;very rare and advantaged business model&#8221;. All this has made the bank a perennial takeover target.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The reincarnation carries some dangers. The bank argues that on most measures, for example the extent to which its loan book is backed by collateral, it has cut risk over the past decade. It does, though, have some tricky positions, such as $10 billion of exposure to the United Arab Emirates. Trading on its own account reached an uncomfortably high 30% of the wholesale unit&#8217;s revenue in the first half of last year. Yet the main warning light flashing from StanChart may be a signal to investment banks, against which it increasingly competes. They typically generate only 10-20% of their business from outside the rich world. Today most have a soft target for this to double within half a decade or so. The idea is to specialise in activities like equity-raising, derivatives and deal advice. Brady Dougan, the boss of Credit Suisse, reckons it is tough to compete on lending. He says that customers &#8220;compartmentalise&#8221;, expecting credit to come from local banks and more sophisticated needs being met by global firms. Kalpana Morparia, JPMorgan&#8217;s feisty boss in India, says that &#8220;we can&#8217;t be a mainstream&#8221; commercial bank in India, and that success is about finding a niche. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But that may not be easy. There will be growing competition not only from the network banks but from local lenders too. Ms Kochhar at ICICI says that the bank rode the wave of consumer lending in India but that the next wave will be banking for companies. &#8220;Global banks are very competitive here,&#8221; says Mr Abreu of Brazil&#8217;s Bradesco, &#8220;but we have space to gain market share.&#8221; At BTG Pactual, the big Brazilian investment bank, which was owned by UBS from 2006 to 2009, Mr Arida says the &#8220;ambivalent commitment&#8221; of foreign investment banks to the country has been their downfall. Unless this changes, he predicts, the business will over time &#8220;be dominated by locals&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Domestic bond and equity markets should grow quickly, with more securities sold to local investors. Today the big Western investment banks dominate the league tables in most categories in places like Asia. This is an offshore business, concentrated in a few finance centres. None has a decent grip on China&#8217;s local A-share market, and in local-currency bond and loan issuance in Asia the only foreigners that get a look-in are the network banks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some investment banks have backtracked. During the crisis UBS foolishly sold Pactual. The best firms are trying to strengthen their local roots. Mr Dougan at Credit Suisse says he wants its emerging-market units to liaise with each other directly, rather than act as satellites of headquarters, and looks to its private bank to help establish strong links with local business people. Gary Cohn, the Cleveland-raised chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, notes that a couple of layers down from the top his firm&#8217;s demography has changed and within a generation its top brass will be less clearly Western. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Less clearly Western is what most rich-world banks these days would like their profit-and-loss accounts to look like, but it is not clear how they can achieve that. Network banking is not an option because they lack the historical connections. The riskier business of investment banking, hard enough in rich countries, may soon get much more crowded in developing countries too. And the strategy of &#8220;going native&#8221; no longer looks possible either, as the next article will show. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Why it is hard to copy Santander</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SANTANDER, the rich world&#8217;s fourth-biggest bank by market value, is a beacon of hope and a source of despair for other firms. Having started as a small regional bank, it pulled itself up by its bootstraps to become a big player in Latin America (as well as in Britain). Yet copying its strategy has become far harder now that most big emerging markets are in effect closed to large takeovers by foreign firms. Although the Spanish bank is dipping a toe into Asia, for example through a co-operation agreement with China Construction Bank, Santander&#8217;s boss, Mr S\xE1enz, is mildly concerned about the industry&#8217;s present frenzy to expand there. The region, he says, is &#8220;closed and expensive&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Santander&#8217;s strategy is to build a deep retail presence with a large market share. A good example of how this works is Brazil. By assets Santander has a market share of 9% there, big enough to compete head-on with the big boys (see chart 9). The network banks are one level below this: HSBC has a 3% share and Citigroup 1%. The investment banks are another step down. Credit Suisse, which has a relatively big Brazilian operation, having bought a local firm, Garantia, in 1988, accounts for only 0.6% of the financial system&#8217;s assets. Santander&#8217;s business is heavily skewed towards lending to individuals and small businesses rather than to big firms. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The same is true of the other &#8220;gone native&#8221; banks. BBVA has a market share of about a quarter in Mexico. In eastern Europe Italian and Austrian banks have pursued a similar strategy. UniCredit, for example, is a mass-market bank in Poland, Bulgaria and Croatia, where it has shares of over 10% by assets. These banks argue that being big in particular countries is more profitable than being widely spread in the manner of the network banks. Ronit Ghose, an analyst at Citigroup, has benchmarked HSBC against local peers in its key regions and concluded that, outside Hong Kong, it typically has a worse cost-income ratio and return on assets, whereas Santander with its higher market shares in Latin America and Britain does better than the locals.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Establishing such positions of strength in depth takes time. Santander made its first round of acquisitions in Brazil in 1997 and its first game-changing one, of Banco Banespa from the Brazilian government, in 2000. Its build-up culminated in its purchase of ABN&#8217;s Brazilian unit in 2007. Nor is it for the faint-hearted. BBVA bought into Brazil in 1998, but by 2003 it had concluded that it was unable to achieve critical mass and sold out to Bradesco. These days even the willing and able simply cannot find much to buy, because most developing countries will sell big banks to foreigners only from positions of weakness. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s Brazil went through a period when it needed foreign capital, investors were still skittish and there was a political commitment to privatisation. In Mexico the government nationalised the banking system in the 1980s and refused to allow foreign firms to buy control when it privatised the system in the early 1990s. The opportunity for foreign banks came after the devastating peso crisis of 1994-95 which eventually caused the rules to be relaxed. That led to BBVA&#8217;s acquisition of Bancomer (2000-02), Santander&#8217;s of Serfin (2000), Citigroup&#8217;s of Banamex (2001) and HSBC&#8217;s of Bital (2002).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Something similar happened in South Korea. Citigroup and Standard Chartered bought their banks from private-equity funds that had picked up controlling stakes in 1999 and 2000 from the wreckage left by the Asian crisis. And in eastern Europe, where Austrian and Italian banks have cleaned up over the past decade, most of the original stakes were taken as cash-strapped governments auctioned banks after the fall of communism. Federico Ghizzoni, who runs UniCredit&#8217;s central and eastern European business, says the majority of its businesses were acquired through privatisations.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Slim pickings</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Are there equivalent opportunities for Western banks today? Mike Smith, chief executive of Australia&#8217;s ANZ and an Asia veteran, says that in some countries in the region smaller family-controlled banks may be up for sale as capital requirements become more onerous. ANZ is also rumoured to be eyeing a bank in South Korea owned by a private-equity fund. But the biggest emerging markets, China, India and Russia, are state-dominated and no big banks are likely to come on the block. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Santander, finding much of the emerging world outside Latin America closed to it, has shifted its strategy. It has expanded through the crisis in Britain, buying bits and pieces (and bidding for some of the branches Royal Bank of Scotland is selling) to add to the base it acquired with Abbey in 2004, gradually building up market share&#8212;much as it did in Brazil. Mr S\xE1enz says the bank has &#8220;faith in a business model more than a geography&#8221;, adding that &#8220;it&#8217;s more likely that in the near future we will invest in more mature economies.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That could include eastern Europe, which has changed from emerging-market darling to villain. Instead of the bullish stories three years ago, when the penetration of banking services was expected to rise to western European levels, there is now deep pessimism about the region&#8217;s adverse demographic profile and its lack of a saving culture. Poland is Santander&#8217;s kind of market, though: biggish and with distressed sellers. Allied Irish Bank, having been bailed out by its government, is auctioning off its operation there, which has a 5% market share. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Other western European firms active in eastern Europe suffered during the crisis and are scaling back, for example KBC and Dexia. The healthy banks are staying put and remain optimistic. Soci\xE9t\xE9 G\xE9n\xE9rale is reorganising its interests in Russia and will get a majority stake in what will become the fifth-biggest firm by loans. It says it is convinced of the long-term potential. UniCredit&#8217;s Mr Ghizzoni says the &#8220;process of convergence will continue&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr S\xE1enz believes that when countries invite in big banks from overseas it &#8220;puts lots of pressure on the competition&#8221;, forcing it to raise its game and allowing economic development to move at a faster pace. Partly because of that, he thinks that in the longer term countries such as India and China might open up somewhat. &#8220;Do I think this will be the situation for the next 20 years? I believe something will happen to these economies that will make them change their mind.&#8221; He points to Mexico&#8217;s sudden opening up in the 1990s. &#8220;My experience is never say that it is closed for ever. Things can change a lot.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Time is what we don&#8217;t have</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But taking the long view is a luxury that less successful banks cannot afford. Waiting for India and China to fall to their knees is hardly a strategy. That leaves those banks with few choices. One is to build branches rather than buy a bank, which might work in some places. Standard Bank, its South African rival FirstRand and some of Nigeria&#8217;s healthy banks are expanding their networks across the rest of Africa, where there is little competition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It might also work for banks with privileged access, for example in China (see ). ANZ is building a bigger presence in Asia, having been ambivalent towards the region for years. Its boss, Mr Smith, explains that Australian businesses are now far more integrated with Asia and that this customer base gives ANZ an edge to expand its business abroad. Still, in most markets local bank bosses are pretty sceptical about Western firms building Rome branch by branch. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they will be major players&#8221; is about the politest comment your correspondent heard. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There is a traditional last resort, used, among others, by Japanese banks in California in the 1980s and more recently by desperadoes in eastern Europe. The formula is to set up a few branches, or pay astronomical prices to buy them, then use funding from your parent or from wholesale credit markets to lend through them. By some estimates half of foreign banks&#8217; loans in central and eastern Europe came from such sources. But regulators are cracking down. The new Basel 3 rules will penalise banks with too much wholesale or cross-border borrowing, and with good reason. A recent IMF briefing contrasted the sharp slowdown in foreign-bank lending in emerging Europe with the much more stable picture in Latin America (see chart 10), where foreign banks typically have bigger branch networks. It concluded that &#8220;foreign-bank lending funded by domestic deposits and denominated in local currency is likely to be more resistant to external financial shocks.&#8221; The days of building up a big loan book without bothering about deposits or branches may be over. As Mr Ghizzoni puts it: &#8220;Some banks had an opportunistic approach. It&#8217;s a game that is at the end.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>So what are traditional banks in Europe and America to do if they want to expand abroad? They face stagnant home markets. They cannot replicate the presence of firms such as Citigroup or HSBC. They have no opportunity to buy dominant positions in attractive geographic markets, as Santander did, and no tradition of competing in sophisticated niches such as investment banking. Even the cheapskate strategy of buying a paper-thin presence is being closed off. Their only consolation is that emerging-market banks face the same dilemmas as they venture abroad. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>To do well in China, Western banks need a long history</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CHINA&#8217;S big banks each &#8220;have almost more branches than we have employees&#8221;, says one Western bank boss. He is only half joking. The big two have over 15,000 branches each. Only a few hundred are owned by foreign firms, which on the mainland have a feeble market share of 2% of total assets. And although many Western banks have been allowed to take passive minority stakes in Chinese financial firms, being given permission to build up a biggish branch network is a privilege granted to the very few. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Only four firms have any scale, and they have been in China for a century. At the end of 2009 HSBC had 99 branches, as well as a further 38 through Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary that is separately listed and run at arm&#8217;s length. Bank of East Asia, run by Sir David Li Kwok-po, whose grandfather traded rice and silk in the late 19th century, had 76 branches and Standard Chartered 54. Citigroup, with 29 branches, is the only firm on the list that does not have lots of branches in Hong Kong, but at least it was exporting silver from San Francisco to Guangzhou in 1904. Sir David says, with wry understatement, that the Chinese authorities &#8220;look at the historical position of a bank&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>By virtue of its size, China is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of banking, says Jonathan Larsen, who runs Citi&#8217;s consumer business in Asia. But all of these firms are subject to restrictions on their branch expansion, loan-to-deposit ratios and local-currency business. Bank of East Asia&#8217;s loan book is made up mainly of loans to Hong Kong companies that are active on the mainland. Getting large amounts of business from state-owned Chinese firms is more difficult. Mr Larsen reckons China might follow Singapore&#8217;s model of development, gradually opening up corporate banking to outside competition first and retail banking later.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some argue that ultimately China is likely to cede only about 15% of the market to Western banks, but even such a comparatively modest share could make a huge difference if it were concentrated among a handful of firms. HSBC made a pre-tax profit of just $111m from its fully owned operations in China in 2009, but bullish analysts reckon that could rise to over $1 billion within a few years. Mr Geoghegan, its chief executive, says China &#8220;will remember for a very long time&#8221; that some banks, including UBS and Bank of America, sold part or all of their stakes in Chinese firms during the financial crisis. What about the long tail of other firms keen to grow in China? Sir David grins: &#8220;Good luck.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>All the world's a stage</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>But emerging-market banks are still treading cautiously abroad</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FROM the rubble of Western banking it is easy to conclude that emerging-market banks are already big, getting bigger, and are coming to get us. Most emerging-market banks do have a sense that they are destined for great things. Mr Kamath at ICICI speaks for many when he says that in the medium term &#8220;we will see a clutch of Indian banks among the top 15 banks in the world.&#8221; Chinese and Brazilian firms are already there and Russia&#8217;s biggest bank is not far off. For all their scale and ambition, however, emerging-market banks mostly still derive only a tiny share of their profits from their foreign operations (see chart 11). How quickly might that change? </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Seen from the hot seat of an emerging-market bank, the world is a dangerous place. Western finance faces an onslaught of regulation and is likely to stagnate. The few investments that emerging countries have made in Western financial firms have tended to turn out badly&#8212;think of China Investment Corporation&#8217;s decision to put money into Blackstone&#8217;s bubble-era flotation, or Ping An Insurance&#8217;s stake in Fortis, which it was forced to write down after the Belgian bank failed. Those who declined invitations to bail out Western firms were proved right. &#8220;I did think I might do a big acquisition,&#8221; says Mr Bhatt of the time when he took over as chairman of State Bank of India in 2006. &#8220;Then the sky fell in.&#8221; He says he has had &#8220;a lot of offers but I have not taken them&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>An emerging-market bank boss also has huge demands placed on him at home: to supply credit, to find capital and to survive the political jungle. And there are the lessons learnt since banking started to go global in the 1970s: the mediocre performance of American commercial banks overseas, the Japanese fiasco, multiple horror stories of commercial banks buying investment banks, and, as the boom peaked, a ruinous hostile acquisition in the form of the RBS-led takeover of ABN AMRO. Most emerging-market banks have plenty of humility. Mr Guo of China Construction Bank says that in rich countries &#8220;we cannot compete with local banks&#8221; for local corporate and retail business.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Instead most banks in the developing world are establishing a &#8220;string of pearls&#8221; abroad to service domestic customers as they expand internationally. At its most basic level this involves setting up branches. Often this expansion is aimed at other emerging economies, not just Western financial centres. Sberbank is opening a branch in Delhi and Ita\xFA has a presence in Shanghai and Dubai as well as the usual offices in London and New York. In India the local banks find it hard to compete on cross-border deals these days. In Bharti Airtel&#8217;s recent $9 billion acquisition the African assets of Zain, a Gulf-based mobile-telecoms firm, Standard Chartered and Barclays led a syndicate of financing banks that included only one local firm, State Bank of India. This is something the locals hope to change. ICICI&#8217;s Ms Kochhar says her bank wants to set up an infrastructure abroad to service Indian firms. Mr Bhatt notes that India&#8217;s banks need to expand with their corporate customers, or &#8220;sooner or later you will be irrelevant.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Forming alliances with local firms is one way of strengthening a string of pearls. In South Africa FirstRand has a pact with China Construction Bank. Sizwe Nxasana, FirstRand&#8217;s chief executive, says his bank was working with them on a number of ad hoc transactions, so a formal agreement &#8220;became a very natural step&#8221;. In one case this has blossomed into an even closer relationship, with China&#8217;s ICBC taking a stake in Standard Bank (see ). Emerging-market banks hope that such co-operation will hone their skills. One consultant who has led workshops for Chinese bankers in international corporate banking says they soak up knowledge &#8220;like a sponge&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A complementary strategy is to provide &#8220;diaspora banking&#8221;. Emerging-market banks have a competitive advantage among compatriots who live in Western countries. ICICI, for example, has small retail operations in Britain and Canada, and Banco do Brasil plans to open 15 new branches in America to target Brazilians living there. The deposits these operations gather are also handy as a foreign funding base. Still, even diaspora banking is not risk-free. In 2007 China Minsheng Bank bought a 10% stake in UCBH Holdings, a San Francisco-based bank that served Chinese-Americans. The bank failed and Minsheng wrote off its investment. Its chairman recently said: &#8220;We&#8217;d like to focus on matters at home now.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the rules of banking overseas do not change just because a firm comes from a developing country. String-of-pearls strategies do not have a great track record. The experience of the Western network banks, most notably ABN, is that relying on expatriate customers to cover your costs does not work. In 1959 First National City Bank (Citigroup&#8217;s predecessor firm) was aiming, in the words of one executive, to put a branch into &#8220;every commercially important country in the world&#8221;. Yet by the late 1960s the strategy had run into trouble. John Reed, who eventually became head of Citi, once said of its overseas branches that they &#8220;didn&#8217;t really know how much they earned&#8221;. The network banks eventually succeeded because they widened their customer base to include locals as well as expatriates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are sceptics even among banks in developing markets. Aditya Puri of HDFC Bank doubts that the number of Indian firms going abroad is big enough yet to make it worth following them: &#8220;We will move when we see a migration of ducks rather than just a single swallow.&#8221; He is of the Santander school of overseas expansion: &#8220;Unless you are a big player in a market, it is not of much use.&#8221; At Santander itself Mr S\xE1enz says he is not planning to expand his network abroad to service Brazilian corporate clients there. That is a small part of the profit pool in Brazil, he says. &#8220;It is not our core business at all.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Two ways in</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The spreading of emerging-market banks&#8217; branches across the world is simply a catching-up process that in itself has little significance. After all, even third-rate European banks have offices in New York and Hong Kong. In the longer term there are two possible approaches that could prove more important. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One is to try to find a competitive advantage. For India&#8217;s banks this could be their low-cost technology&#8212;&#8220;the edge&#8221;, as Mr Kamath puts it. A big test of this will be State Bank of India&#8217;s expansion in retail banking in Singapore. Mr Bhatt says the bank is catering to the whole population, not just Indians, and will keep the back office in low-cost India. Many bankers in Mumbai speculate that this might produce a new twist on Western firms outsourcing to India: Indian banks will buy rich-country banks to get a shop front, then move the back office to India. Brazil&#8217;s banks, meanwhile, are betting on investment banking. Bradesco&#8217;s Mr Abreu says: &#8220;Brazil is still where we have the best opportunities. But what we are really focusing on abroad is to expand our investment bank.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The other possibility is to make acquisitions. There are very few, if any, examples of Western banks building a big presence abroad branch by branch. The way all commercial banks, even the network banks, went global is through deals. But acquisitions in banking are harder than in most industries. The politics are controversial. The financial risks are high because of leverage. And because banks have no physical plant beyond their branches, their value rests in their staff, who might wander off. To do this well, you need practice.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>China&#8217;s banks have been practising in their &#8220;near abroad&#8221;. ICBC has bought small banks in Indonesia, Thailand and Macau. China Construction Bank has acquired bits of Bank of America and American International Group in Hong Kong. These are small deals by value but, says CCB&#8217;s Mr Guo, &#8220;very significant&#8221; because they will help improve the bank&#8217;s capabilities. Sberbank has bought small operations in Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Banco do Brasil has just bought a controlling stake in a mid-size Argentine bank, and Ita\xFA already has a presence in neighbouring countries. Even Bradesco, less expansive by instinct, recently bought a small bank in Mexico. Mr Abreu says it is a very cautious first step.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Will such first steps lead to greater leaps abroad? Certainly stories of giant deals make the rounds: your correspondent heard a yarn about a Chinese bank board discussing whether to bid for Merrill Lynch. And if the crisis had turned out differently, some emerging-market banks might have taken the plunge. During its darkest hours Citigroup considered selling Banamex, Mexico&#8217;s second-biggest bank. Had it done so, the new owner might have been one of Brazil&#8217;s banks. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the expansion of emerging-market banks into the rest of the world depends on two things. One is that they grow even bigger and accumulate more capital and more skills. This seems all but inevitable. The second condition is that the globalisation of banking, a trend that has governed the industry for two decades, continues. And that is far from certain. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A door to Africa</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Standard Bank reaps the benefit of bold thinking</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TO UNDERSTAND where Standard Bank is today, says its boss, Jacko Maree, you have to go back to South Africa in early 1987, when Standard Chartered, its original parent, sold out completely. Most South African firms were not welcome in the rest of Africa, he says, and &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t entirely obvious&#8221; that Standard Bank&#8217;s priority should be there or indeed in emerging markets at all. When South Africa moved to majority rule in the 1990s, plenty of South African firms shifted their domicile to London and tried to diversify into developed markets, but Standard Bank stuck to its guns. Something of this determination is reflected in its choice to keep its headquarters in downtown Johannesburg even though most financial firms moved to Sandton, a safe but dull suburb where adventure is a bar named the Bull Run.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Maree, at the cuddly end of the spectrum of South African bankers, has been pretty astute. He became chief executive in 1999 after a failed takeover bid for his bank, which he says &#8220;was a big kick up the backside&#8221;. That meant making more of its main activities abroad: an African presence built from branches bought from Australia&#8217;s ANZ in 1992; an investment-banking unit in London (originally put there because of foreign-exchange controls in South Africa); and small operations elsewhere, including Russia, where natural-resources banking, an obvious specialism for African firms, is important.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The result has been solid, with compound annual growth in profits per share of 8% since 2003 and only a small dent in earnings from the financial crisis. In 2009 almost a quarter of profits came from abroad, either the rest of Africa or indirectly linked to the continent&#8212;for example, currency trades executed in London.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>South Africa has had two lending booms since the end of apartheid. The first was driven by the opening of the economy to foreign capital, the second by lending to the rising black elite over the past decade. As a market it is fairly mature. But Africa as a whole is set for a &#8220;tectonic shift&#8221;, says Goolam Ballim, Standard Bank&#8217;s chief economist. The proportion of Africa&#8217;s trade with China, Brazil, India and Russia rose from 5% in 1993 to 19% in 2008. Much of this, inevitably, is in resources, but governments are getting better at saving the proceeds of the good times for the less good ones, reckons Mr Ballim. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Old Africa hands who used to roll their eyes at this kind of analysis got a surprise in 2007 when ICBC, now the world&#8217;s largest bank, spent $5.5 billion on a 20% stake in Standard Bank in what was then China&#8217;s largest ever corporate foreign investment. Mr Maree and Mr Jiang, ICBC&#8217;s chairman, stitched the deal together after spending a day in Cape Town together. There is still a wow factor about it, says Mr Maree. Although the revenues generated from working with ICBC are modest&#8212;some $78m in 2009&#8212;co-operation is being stepped up. Standard Bank has 30 bankers in Beijing now, as well as a main board director in an office close to ICBC&#8217;s, who help clients of the Chinese bank interested in expanding in Africa. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For China&#8217;s banks the deal is a test case of whether &#8220;treading softly&#8221; overseas will work. The combination ticks every box, bringing a presence in key markets for Chinese clients and exposure to a sophisticated foreign firm with skills in areas like investment banking and foreign-currency funding. Yet ICBC has limited influence with Standard Bank, with only a couple of directors on its board. A full takeover looks unlikely. ICBC would need permission from Standard Bank&#8217;s board to buy more shares, and South Africa&#8217;s government would probably not approve.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For Standard Bank the merits of the deal are clear: more capital, and kudos, to build a bigger presence in Africa and elsewhere. It is mulling buying a bank in Nigeria (where the government is opening up more to foreigners). And it is eyeing India, which Mr Maree says is &#8220;the missing link&#8221;, given that Standard Bank already has an operation in Brazil and a stake in a Russian investment bank, Troika Dialog. With Standard Bank&#8217;s complex history and relatively isolated position, explains Mr Maree, &#8220;we&#8217;ve had to think in a much more out-of-the-box way.&#8221;</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Cross your fingers</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Emerging-market banks have done remarkably well, but they need all the luck they can get</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BANKERS in many rich countries failed two tests over the past decade. The first was the test of the marketplace, which exposed many banks that proved unable to command the confidence of their investors and counterparties or even to make a profit during a downturn. In the end they required government help to fund themselves and get hold of capital.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The bigger test was that of being &#8220;socially useful&#8221;, in which the whole system got poor grades. Too much energy was put into speculation and complexity. Rather than being a source of stability, banks intensified the economic cycle, with firms showing little discipline during the boom and no humility afterwards. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Compared with their Western peers, emerging-market banks are mostly A-grade pupils. As businesses they are in good fettle, partly because of their youth and their natural advantages. They have plenty of funds because the societies they operate in have high saving rates. Their profits are stable, not least because their capital markets are small and volatile investment banking is not a big business yet. Yet much of their success reflects good management and good regulation. Supervisors learnt from the many crises in emerging markets over the years and made sure that banks had decent capital ratios and plenty of liquid assets. These firms tend to keep a good balance between old-fashioned banking values and innovation in customer products and technology.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On the wider test of performing a useful economic role, emerging-market banks have come out of the crisis well. Most of them genuinely believe in the importance of providing more people with access to financial services. The banking system as a whole continued to extend credit throughout the crisis. State-controlled banks did the heavy lifting, lending freely through 2008 and 2009, but private firms too performed reasonably well, whereas some Western firms in emerging markets proved unreliable, cutting credit or even shutting down or selling out. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This special report has argued that the experience of emerging-market banks will have a lasting impact. A fairly traditional banking business model has worked. That means Western firms without big local deposit bases and serious intentions to grow deep local roots will be less welcome. The few American and European firms that already have solid emerging-market businesses have been very fortunate, and there is little chance that others will be able to replicate their model.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It also means that a mixed banking sector&#8212;with state-owned and private firms, as well as some foreign ones&#8212;will stay in place. This balance is now seen as a good thing in its own right rather than just a stage on the road to full market ownership. Big privatisation programmes are not on the cards. That will make it hard for Western firms without emerging-markets exposure to get established.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Big and getting even bigger, well run and well regulated: the emerging-market banks seem to have a lot going for them. At the same time their Western peers are dazed, under attack and shrinking. Yet for all their success, emerging-market banks face two big challenges. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>The ifs and buts</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The first is coping with exceptionally rapid growth without blowing up. The absolute volume of loans many banks are adding in a year now is often bigger than the entire bank was a decade ago. Growing at a rate of 20% a year will impose colossal pressures on everything from staffing levels to risk control. And to sustain it, these firms will have to plunge headlong into products they know little about, such as mortgages. Yet if their economies keep roaring ahead, the stodgy business of lending to companies will suffer as alternative means of finance for businesses open up. Emerging-market banks say this activity is not very profitable anyway, but they are bound to miss it if it goes.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The second challenge is the greater involvement of the state in the past few years. Although this has served emerging economies well, it brings its own problems. There is ample historical evidence that government control over banks&#8217; lending can breed cronyism and misallocation of funds. China will be a test case after its big lending spree of the past 18 months. At least in other developing countries the government&#8217;s role in bank lending has been much less overt. Still, state-controlled banks, which hold the majority of assets in the financial system in China, Russia and India and over 40% in Brazil, will have to juggle their dual personalities as independent agents (often with minority stockmarket listings) and public servants. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most emerging-market banks are pursuing a cautious string-of-pearls strategy abroad, but the lesson from Western banks is that this is a quick way to lose money. To succeed in expanding abroad, banks need scale and a local deposit and customer base. New regulations will make this even more important. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As emerging-market banks begin to consider bigger acquisitions, they will find that being state-controlled will be a serious disadvantage. This is partly because banking in the rich world has become more politicised. But it is also because the conservative culture of many state banks is ill-suited to foreign takeovers, and because many customers would prefer to deal with a privately owned bank. That means India&#8217;s and Brazil&#8217;s private banks, although smaller than China&#8217;s, may have an easier time expanding abroad.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Emerging-market banks are not about to take over the world. They have far too much to do at home: double the size of their business every five years or so, avoid bad debts, find more capital, cope with rapidly shifting patterns of corporate lending, bring banking to millions of poor people and deal with the politicians. Can they really do all this? Most have already performed miracles over the past few decades, from surviving political earthquakes to coping with hyperinflation, and prospered throughout a crisis that felled Western banks. But if the strength of emerging-market banks today is impressive, the task they face is also huge. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n <br clear=\"all\">\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Online services that match freelancers with piecework are growing in hard times</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | SAN FRANCISCO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT WAS not the Christmas present that Julie Babikan had been hoping for. In December 2008, soon after buying a house, she was abruptly fired from her job as a graphic designer at an accounting firm in Chicago. &#8220;I had no clue that my position was about to be eliminated,&#8221; she recalls. Desperate to find work as the economy tipped into chaos, Ms Babikan scoured job ads to no avail. Eventually she decided to advertise for work on a service called Elance, which allows freelancers to bid for corporate piecework. She has since built up a healthy stream of online projects and reckons she will soon be earning more than she did in her previous job.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Like Ms Babikan, millions of workers are embracing freelancing as an alternative to full-time employment or because they cannot find salaried jobs. According to IDC, a market-research firm, there were around 12m full-time, home-based freelancers and independent contractors in America alone at the end of last year and there will be 14m by 2015. Experts reckon this number will keep rising for several reasons, including a sluggish jobs market and workers&#8217; growing desire for the flexibility to be able to look after parents or children.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Technology is also driving the trend. Over the past few years a host of fast-growing firms such as Elance, oDesk and LiveOps have begun to take advantage of &#8220;the cloud&#8221;&#8212;tech-speak for the combination of ubiquitous fast internet connections and cheap, plentiful web-based computing power&#8212;to deliver sophisticated software that makes it easier to monitor and manage remote workers. Maynard Webb, the boss of LiveOps, which runs virtual call centres with an army of over 20,000 home workers in America, says the company&#8217;s revenue exceeded $125m in 2009. He is confidently expecting a sixth year of double-digit growth this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although numerous online exchanges still act primarily as brokers between employers in rich countries and workers in poorer ones, the number of rich-world freelancers is growing. Gary Swart, the boss of oDesk, says the number of freelancers registered with the firm in America has risen from 28,000 at the end of 2008 to 247,000 at the end of April.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That may, in part, be a reflection of American bosses&#8217; ruthless cuts in full-time jobs, forcing those laid off to scramble for whatever work they can find. But it is also a sign of another notable trend: the range of work available on &#8220;e-lancing&#8221; sites is growing to encompass more complex and better-paid tasks. &#8220;We&#8217;re starting to see legal and financial work coming online,&#8221; notes Mr Swart, who says he has recently been talking with a big American insurance company that is thinking of farming out claims adjustments via oDesk. Recent projects posted on Freelancer.com, a rival site, include the composition of a rap song to help teach English to Chinese students and a design for a luxury hotel in Barbados. Such work is more likely to be won by educated Western workers, especially if it requires local knowledge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> To boost demand for their services, online employment outfits have developed sophisticated software to screen workers and to manage their relations with employers. LiveOps, for instance, submits people who would like to join its pool of freelancers to a battery of tests to assess their suitability for cloud-mediated work. More controversially, oDesk has developed tools that let employers check on work being done out of their sight. These include a feature that takes a screenshot of a worker&#8217;s desktop six times every hour, combining them to form a &#8220;work diary&#8221;, and another that measures overall time spent using a keyboard and mouse.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Swart insists oDesk&#8217;s approach does not amount to installing &#8220;spyware&#8221; on workers&#8217; computers and points out that they are free to remove pages from the online diaries if they so wish. Yet employers are likely to outsource important projects only if they can track their progress closely.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Workers may put up with such Big Brother-ish monitoring because oDesk guarantees them payment for any work they complete, saving them the hassle and risk of attempting to collect money from employers. Other sites are also experimenting with payment models. Australia&#8217;s 99designs, which matches 70,000 designers&#8212;40% of whom are in America&#8212;with online tasks, collects money upfront from customers and only pays it out when projects meet agreed targets. It also gives employers a money-back guarantee if they are dissatisfied with the work done, though refund rates, it claims, are very low.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Some in the fledgling industry reckon that the growth of &#8220;e-labour&#8221; will mirror that of e-commerce, which took longer than expected to catch on. &#8220;By 2020 we may represent just one to two percent of the world&#8217;s work,&#8221; says Mr Webb, who used to be a senior executive at eBay. &#8220;But five years after that it will have taken off.&#8221; One reason for this, he explains, is that younger workers will want many jobs during their careers and will be more comfortable with the technology that makes remote working possible.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The industry will have to negotiate several hurdles if it is to realise Mr Webb&#8217;s vision. The first is the natural conservatism of managers who like to see the whites of employees&#8217; eyes. &#8220;There are some jobs where you really want a person to yell at,&#8221; jokes Lukas Biewald of CrowdFlower, another e-lancing site. That may be one reason why most work in the cloud is still done on behalf of small and medium-sized companies that do not have the luxury of gargantuan budgets. Some large firms have dipped their toes in the water&#8212;LiveOps, for instance, has handled specific projects for the likes of Kodak and Coca-Cola&#8212;but few have taken a plunge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> The industry also has to overcome frequent criticism that it is running little more than &#8220;digital sweatshops&#8221; that drive down wages and humiliate workers. The regulatory environment, too, is uncertain. Alek Felstiner of the University of California at Berkeley&#8217;s school of law predicts that some governments will draw up rules that make it harder for firms that regularly tap workers in the cloud to label them as independent contractors rather than employees with more rights.</p>\r\n\

    <h1>Nay on pay</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>America&#8217;s shareholders find a voice to condemn undeserved compensation</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT IS too soon to call it a trend, but the fact that America&#8217;s normally passive shareholders have voted against executive pay packages at two big companies within a week suggests that something is going on. The 54% of votes cast against the remuneration of Sanjay Jha, Motorola&#8217;s chief executive, at the phonemaker&#8217;s annual meeting on May 3rd, marked the first time that American shareholders had ever rejected a boss&#8217;s pay. Four days later they did it again, voting against the wages of Ray Irani, boss of Occidental Petroleum.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such expressions of discontent are unprecedented in America, not least because until recently no one bothered to ask shareholders to approve executive pay. Last year was the first time a significant number of American firms gave shareholders a &#8220;say on pay&#8221;, although the votes are usually not binding, and many of the firms that have adopted them were forced to do so as a condition of a government bail-out. This year around 300 big companies are giving shareholders a vote. If certain proposals in the financial-reform bill now before Congress become law, say on pay will become the norm for American public companies, as it already is in Britain.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In 2003 Jean-Pierre Garnier, the chief executive at the time of GlaxoSmithKline, became the first boss to lose a shareholder vote under the say-on-pay rules adopted in Britain a year earlier. The first two Americans to suffer the indignity of defeat made obvious targets. The $52.2m that Occidental paid Mr Irani for his services in 2009 not only made him the highest-paid boss at America&#8217;s 200 biggest firms; it also made him one of the most overpaid, once the performance of his firm&#8217;s shares is taken into account. Graef Crystal, a veteran analyst of undeserved executive pay, had singled out Mr Irani&#8217;s package for criticism on the grounds that the payment was in cash and that Mr Irani&#8217;s performance targets had been lowered. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As for Mr Jha, Motorola&#8217;s board seems to have ignored the shot fired across its bow by shareholders last year, when over one-third of them opposed his pay package. The board&#8217;s decision to give him a stake of up to 3% in the company he will run if Motorola is split in two, or a guaranteed payment if the planned break-up does not happen by June 2011, seems to have provoked the No vote. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One test of the significance of the two reversals will be how the boards of Motorola and Occidental respond. So far they have only issued boilerplate comments, promising to engage with shareholders &#8220;to get a better understanding of any specific concerns they may have&#8221; (Motorola) and to use their input to &#8220;re-evaluate the company&#8217;s compensation philosophy, objectives and policies&#8221; (Occidental).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another test will be how widespread shareholder activism on pay becomes. Saying no to the greediest outliers may have little impact on remuneration at the average firm. &#8220;I&#8217;d have liked to see more No votes at other companies,&#8221; says Nell Minow of the Corporate Library, which conducts research on corporate governance. She had expected pay at firms bailed out by the government to come under close scrutiny from shareholders, but so far that particular dog has failed to bark.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In Britain, No votes have remained a rarity since shareholders snubbed Mr Garnier. Indeed, it was not until last year that another pay package got a majority of No votes&#8212;that of Royal Dutch Shell&#8217;s senior executives. However, activists argue that the right to vote on pay has led to far more consultation of shareholders by boards seeking to ensure that pay packages will not be controversial. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard Law School argues that shareholder rights in general are less strong in America than Britain, &#8220;so there may be less pressure on boards to react to signals sent by shareholders.&#8221; It is much harder for American shareholders, for example, to force out recalcitrant directors. So much will depend on two other reforms currently under consideration in Congress. The first would require would-be directors to win a majority of votes cast to secure seats on a board. At present at many American firms, directors can be elected despite overwhelming opposition if no other candidates win more votes&#8212;something that is quite common because it is hard to get onto the ballot in the first place. For that reason, the second reform would make it easier for shareholders to nominate candidates. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Thus empowered, shareholders should be able to sling off the board members of compensation committees who ignore their advice on pay. In particular, they would be likely to target the chair of the compensation committee&#8212;people such as Spencer Abraham, a former energy secretary and senator who holds the position at Occidental, and Samuel Scott, a former boss of Corn Products International, at Motorola&#8212;who are arguably more to blame for excessive pay packages than the bosses who receive them. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Hands up for handouts</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Taxpayer subsidies to companies have multiplied in the recession</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | BERLIN | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EUROPEAN firms are impressively innovative when it comes to securing cash from taxpayers. Even though the European Union officially frowns on state aid because it threatens its cherished single market, there are so many loopholes in the Brussels rule book that even the dullest bureaucrat and least competitive company can usually find one.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the German state of Lower Saxony, for instance, farmers can claim compensation for beehives that are destroyed by the wild wolves that have been reintroduced to the area in recent years. Lest anyone think the European Commission short-sighted, it has also made allowance for damage which may be caused by lynx and bears, if these beasts are also released into the wild in future. This is in addition to the &#8364;55 billion ($70 billion) that Europe hands farmers each year under its Common Agricultural Policy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Industrial undertakings have been no less adept at harvesting subsidies. German coal producers still get &#8364;2 billion a year from their government to help the country produce greenhouse gases. France, meanwhile, is giving &#8364;19m to GDF Suez, a utility, to help it reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by studying biofuels. On May 3rd the company reported a profit for the first quarter of &#8364;5.2 billion before interest and tax. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>European companies were no slouches at scrounging before the financial crisis, but since its onset the clattering of their begging bowls has become relentless. When the crisis first struck, the commission&#8217;s competition regulators relaxed their rules on state aid to allow the bail-out of banks and to help firms that suddenly faced a dearth of credit. Many deserving firms had indeed been deprived of working capital, say, or trade finance. But in opening the door to helping them the commission seems to have created a loophole big enough for farmers and industrialists to drive their tractors and forklifts through.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>By the end of February the commission had approved 70 schemes allowing countries to give handouts to tens of thousands of farms and firms. Many of them, however, have little connection with the credit crunch. Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain have all won permission to subsidise the production of &#8220;green&#8221; goods with cheap loans. In most cases the money will go to carmakers and their suppliers. The sums are far from trivial. Britain&#8217;s application said it expects more than 1,000 companies to benefit from as much as \xA38 billion ($12 billion) in subsidised loans.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Carmakers will also get a break in Sweden. Saab and Volvo may receive government-guaranteed loans, ostensibly to improve the efficiency of their cars. Yet Saab has lost money for years and Volvo has been only marginally profitable. Another car company keen for a handout is Ford. Although it pointedly declined a bail-out in America, it has been happy to take grants and soft loans in Germany and Romania to develop an efficient engine. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Farmers, too, have been quick to use the crisis as a reason to ask for extra help even though subsidies already account for about a third of their income. Because of a particularly sharp drop in milk prices, the commission agreed to allow governments to hand dairy farmers &#8364;15,000 each. Several countries, Austria and Britain among them, have applied to do so. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the economic crisis that is the reason for the jump in state aid may also limit the amount that governments can afford to hand out. Some are already having second thoughts. Spain, for instance, initially asked for permission to lavish &#8364;300m on carmakers. Now it thinks it may struggle to find even &#8364;100m to subsidise green car production. And in Britain the National Farmers Union laments that its members are unlikely to see much if any of the hoped-for &#8364;15,000 a head. If only they had some wolves to fall back on. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Pedals of fire</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The Chinese authorities weigh the pros and cons of motorised bicycles</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>PEDESTRIANS in China are often terrorised by electric bicycles zipping along the country&#8217;s pavements. China&#8217;s authorities, too, seem to have been caught unawares by an industry that, like the bikes themselves, has emerged speedily and stealthily from the shadows: local output grew from a few thousand bikes a year less than a decade ago to more than 22m last year, along with millions of kits to turn ordinary bicycles into electric ones. Annual sales have reached about $11 billion. The government is suddenly paying attention&#8212;but its urge to regulate is pulling it in two different directions.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More and more Chinese cyclists, it seems, would like a battery and motor to turn the wheels for them. Production of ordinary bicycles, which peaked in 2006 at nearly 80m units, has since fallen by more than 25%. But as with many businesses in China, the electric-bike industry is plagued by too much capacity, thin margins and variable quality. More than 2,600 firms had permits to make electric bikes last year, although only around 1,000 are thought to be using them. Most started as conventional bicycle-makers; others have come from the motorcycle business. The biggest manufacturer, Jiangsu Xinri Electric Vehicle Co, produced 1.8m &#8220;e-bikes&#8221; last year. Its lead is under threat from at least half a dozen other manufacturers. One rival, Tianjin Aima Science and Technology Co, says it is gearing up to make more than 5m bikes a year; Jiangsu Yadea Technical Development Co hopes to triple its sales to 3m this year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Manufacturers believe exports will grow quickly, especially to Europe and North America, which accounted for more than 70% of the nearly 1m bikes sent abroad in 2009. One in every eight bicycles sold in the Netherlands these days is electric. Better yet, Chinese manufacturers secured an average price of $377 per exported bike, compared with less than $100 three years ago and just $46 for a pedal bike. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the government is threatening to put a legislative spoke in the industry&#8217;s wheels. Until recently there were few laws regulating electric bikes: they do not need to be registered, nor do their drivers need a licence. Unsurprisingly, the 120m bikes in use are involved in a growing number of accidents. Almost 2,500 electric-bike-related deaths were recorded in 2007. At night pedestrians are at particular risk, because many e-cyclists drive without lights to save power. More than a dozen cities have introduced restrictions of one sort or another. In theory, the government has limited electric bikes&#8217; top speed to 20kph (12mph), but in practice most can go much faster. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet the government also wants to encourage electric bicycles to curb the pollution and congestion created by other vehicles. Local authorities in some cities have stoked sales by raising the price of permits for petrol-fuelled scooters or banning them altogether. The authorities are also trying to make e-bikes themselves greener: manufacturers are being compelled to invest in lighter materials and to replace lead-acid batteries with lithium ones. Market leaders such as Xinri and Yadea are partnering with universities to improve their technology. Some ambitious producers are talking about turning their hands to electric cars. Perhaps then their customers will stick to the roads. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Short-term memory gain</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Will a takeover and new technology revive the German software giant?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>WHEN Bill McDermott and Jim Hageman Snabe jointly took the helm at SAP in February they promised to be much &#8220;bolder&#8221;. The troubled German software giant would move faster to acquire other companies, and new products would be introduced more quickly. &#8220;We&#8217;re off to a very fast start,&#8221; the pair said in unison.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This was not idle chatter. On May 12th SAP announced that it would buy Sybase, a vendor of database software, in a deal worth $5.8 billion&#8212;the second-biggest purchase in the company&#8217;s history. Next week, at the firm&#8217;s annual customer conference, to be held simultaneously in Frankfurt and Orlando, it will introduce new technology, loosely called &#8220;in-memory&#8221;, that is intended to re-install SAP as an industry leader.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The acquisition of Sybase deepens SAP&#8217;s rivalry with Oracle, the other big maker of business applications, which has performed more strongly of late (see chart). Whereas Oracle has snapped up dozens of firms, SAP has grown mainly organically. The takeover of Sybase will help SAP to catch up. It will give the firm access to new customers, particularly in financial services, and new products, such as databases and software to make applications available on mobile devices.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet it is next week&#8217;s announcement that is the more important for SAP. It became the world&#8217;s third-largest software firm by seizing on the shift from mainframes to networks of smaller machines in the 1990s. Now corporate computing is once again going through an important change. As memory chips get cheaper, more and more of them are being packed into servers. This means that firms, instead of having to store their data on separate disks, can put most of them into their servers&#8217; short-term memory, where they can be accessed and manipulated faster and more easily. The software SAP is releasing next week, a new version of Business ByDesign, its suite of online services for small companies, aims to capitalise on this trend, dubbed &#8220;in-memory&#8221;. SAP also plans to rewrite other programs along similar lines. &#8220;The bet on in-memory may well decide whether we&#8217;ll be swallowed like Sun Microsystems or become the BMW of enterprise software,&#8221; says an executive at the firm.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In-memory technology is already widespread in systems that simply analyse data, but using it to help process transactions is a bigger step. SAP&#8217;s software dispenses with the separate &#8220;relational databases&#8221; where the data behind such transactions are typically stored, and instead retains the data within the server&#8217;s memory. This, says Vishal Sikka, the firm&#8217;s chief technologist, not only speeds up existing programs&#8212;it also makes them cheaper to run and easier to upgrade, and makes possible real-time monitoring of a firm&#8217;s performance.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some observers are not convinced. They have not forgotten that many of SAP&#8217;s new products in the past decade have not been big successes, not least Business ByDesign. &#8220;There is healthy scepticism as to whether all this will work,&#8221; says Brent Thill of UBS, an investment bank. Existing customers may prefer not to risk disrupting their customised computer systems by adopting the new software.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And then there is the competition. Workday, which offers online services to manage employees and finances much like Business ByDesign, has been using in-memory technology for some time. Oracle is also on the case. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that other vendors can&#8217;t catch up,&#8221; says James Staten of Forrester Research, a consultancy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These efforts suggest that in-memory will proliferate, regardless of how SAP will fare. That could change the way many firms do business. Why, for example, keep a general ledger, if financial reports can be compiled on the fly? Hasso Plattner, SAP&#8217;s chairman and the instigator of the firm&#8217;s in-memory efforts, thinks the trend could help streamline the world&#8217;s supply chains: &#8220;The faster software can process data and plan demand, the fewer physical parts have to be stored.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In-memory could also redistribute the cards in the computer industry. If SAP&#8217;s approach proves successful, the makers of software for relational databases could lose some of their clout. Larry Ellison, the boss of Oracle, which makes most of its money from such software, has ridiculed SAP&#8217;s idea of an in-memory database, calling it &#8220;wacko&#8221; and asking for &#8220;the name of their pharmacist&#8221;. Mr Plattner, not to be outdone, retorts that it doesn&#8217;t take a psychologist to understand why Mr Ellison might say such a thing. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Relapse</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The battle between politicians and insurers is not over</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A CASUAL observer could be forgiven for thinking that the long and bloody battle over health reform in America was over. After all, despite a year of hostile lobbying by the insurance firms, the Democrat-controlled Congress approved sweeping changes to their industry in late March. Yet the skirmishing continues. A recent press report claimed that WellPoint, a big health insurer, was targeting breast cancer patients for &#8220;rescission&#8221;&#8212;that is, cutting off sick patients over technicalities such as improperly completed paperwork. First the secretary of health reprimanded the firm; then on May 8th Barack Obama himself appeared to do so as well. That led a furious Angela Braly, WellPoint&#8217;s chief executive, to fire back the next day, denouncing him for repeating &#8220;false information&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What is going on? In part, the administration is demonising insurers in an effort to transform the new health law from an electoral liability into an asset. The industry has not helped itself much on this front. For a start, the lavish salaries earned by the industry&#8217;s bosses make it easy to paint them as fat cats. Public outrage has also been stoked by insurers&#8217; attempts to win regulators&#8217; approval for huge rate increases for certain types of customers. Anthem Blue Cross, the Californian division of WellPoint, tried to raise the price of some policies by nearly 40% a year. The uproar this provoked only grew when a state-appointed actuary concluded that the firm&#8217;s justification for the hike was bogus. Several investigations of different insurers have since been instigated on similar grounds.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another tactic used by the administration to sell health reform to a sceptical public is to trumpet tangible benefits the law will bring. The snag is that most of the reform&#8217;s provisions will not take effect in time to influence congressional elections in November. In fact, because the Democrats wanted to make the plan appear more affordable in the short term, the law&#8217;s most costly but also most popular provisions (such as subsidies to help buy insurance) do not kick in for four years or so. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That has left the administration browbeating the insurance industry to adopt reforms ahead of the schedule laid out in the law. On May 10th Kathleen Sebelius, the health secretary, sent a letter to congressional leaders trumpeting the various concessions she has won. For example, firms have agreed to allow children to remain covered by their parents&#8217; policies up to the age of 26&#8212;a measure that should please the 30% of young adults who are uninsured. She also claimed that firms have agreed not to drop children with &#8220;pre-existing conditions&#8221; (a nasty practice that, for adults, will be banned from 2014). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The insurance industry, meanwhile, is in a fighting mood about another measure that cuts deep into its profits. A &#8220;medical loss ratio&#8221; (MLR) provision in the new law dictates that insurers spend most of the money they earn from premiums (at least 85% in the case of group policies) on actual medical costs, rather than administrative overheads or fat-cat salaries. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In effect, the rule places a cap on insurance firms&#8217; future profits. Moody&#8217;s, a rating agency, has downgraded the debt of Aetna, a giant insurer, in part because of such concerns. A report released on May 12th by PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that insurers, especially those in the market for individual coverage, cannot currently meet the new MLR targets and therefore &#8220;must lower administrative expenses&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That will not be easy, though. Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate&#8217;s Commerce Committee, this week warned insurers that he is on the lookout for attempts to water down MLRs by reclassifying administrative expenses as genuine medical costs. The squeeze is on, and insurers should not expect any relief&#8212;or not before November, at any rate. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>Blowout</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The Supreme Court dismantles one obstacle to investment and erects another</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | DELHI | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE long dispute between Mukesh and Anil Ambani, feuding billionaire brothers, over the price of natural gas from a field controlled by Mukesh&#8217;s Reliance Industries was said to have been deterring investment in oil and gas in India. If so, the resolution of the dispute, in the form of a Supreme Court ruling in Mukesh&#8217;s favour on May 7th, has probably made matters worse.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In 2005 Reliance Industries agreed to sell gas from its D-6 lease in the Bay of Bengal to Anil&#8217;s Reliance Natural Resources for 17 years at $2.34 per million British thermal units. But in 2007 the government waded in, raising the price to $4.20. Mumbai&#8217;s High Court had upheld the original agreement, but the Supreme Court ruled that the government&#8217;s directive superseded the Ambanis&#8217; contract. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The idea that the government has the power to set prices for natural resources is naturally off-putting to oil and gas firms. It adds massive &#8220;above ground&#8221; risks to the already considerable ones they face beneath the soil. Indeed, the ruling is likely to worry firms of all kinds in that it appears to undermine the sanctity of contracts in general.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is unlikely to help India, which imports more than 70% of its oil, to achieve its goal of attracting $40 billion in investment in oil and gas by 2012. Recent discoveries, including that of Reliance Industries in the D-6 lease, have proven the potential. Some 22% of the sort of territory that might contain oil is still unexplored. Last year the government extended tax breaks for gas discoveries, in line with similar concessions on oil finds. Yet the most recent sale of exploration rights attracted a lukewarm response from foreign bidders. The next round may not fare much better.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There may still be one enthusiastic investor, however: Mukesh Ambani. Reliance Industries is now likelier to develop other fields in the D-6 lease, which might have lain fallow had the court upheld the lower price.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Emergency repairs</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A promised huge rescue fund and central-bank help for indebted governments have eased the euro area&#8217;s crisis. The respite must be used wisely</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR weeks, Europe&#8217;s policymakers have stood accused of doing too little, too late as the sovereign-debt crisis that engulfed Greece threatened to spread to Portugal, Spain, Ireland and perhaps elsewhere. By May 7th, as yields on vulnerable euro-area countries&#8217; government bonds rose sharply, there seemed to be a real threat that foreign financing for these countries would stop. That in turn raised fears about the exposure of banks to European governments and private borrowers. Europe&#8217;s Lehman moment, it seemed, might be at hand.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The European Union&#8217;s policymakers were forced to act with unaccustomed speed and unprecedented force. In the early hours of May 10th finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, agreed on an extensive scheme of repairs for the euro zone. The biggest stack of financial scaffolding is a &#8220;stabilisation fund&#8221;, worth up to &#8364;500 billion ($635 billion). This includes &#8364;60 billion to be financed by EU bonds that can be sold fairly quickly&#8212;as much as can be raised over three years without breaching the union&#8217;s budget ceiling. This element had to be approved by EU members, such as Britain, which do not use the euro, because their taxpayers would also be on the hook were the money not repaid in full. (It is an extension of a similar &#8364;50 billion fund for non-euro countries with balance-of-payments problems.) The stabilisation fund would be supplemented by up to &#8364;250 billion more from the IMF.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In addition, the European Central Bank (ECB) said it would purchase government bonds to restore calm to &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221; markets. It will offer banks unlimited cash at a fixed interest rate at its next two scheduled three-month financing operations on May 26th and June 30th. The ECB also reopened credit lines that had been put in place in the autumn of 2008, in post-Lehman days, with the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, so that it will be able to lend European banks dollars and other currencies.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Financial markets&#8217; initial response was euphoric. Germany&#8217;s stockmarket closed more than 5% higher on May 10th. France&#8217;s main index went up by almost 10%: big French banks are heavily exposed to Greece, so they stand to benefit from a guarantee of rescue. The yield on ten-year Greek government bonds plunged from more than 12% to less than 8%. Yields on comparable Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish bonds also fell sharply&#8212;mostly, it seems, because of purchases by the ECB (see chart 1).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, this giddy joy soon gave way to a more sober view, for three main reasons. First, the rescue plan has a patched-together feel. Many of the details are still missing. Second, the fact that the ECB is buying the debt of euro-area governments raises questions about the central bank&#8217;s much-trumpeted independence of politicians&#8212;and hence about its credibility as an inflation-fighter. And third, the package, impressive though its scale and speed may be, only buys time for troubled governments to cut their budget deficits and put in place structural reforms needed to improve their lost export competitiveness. If that time is wasted, even worse trouble may lie ahead for the euro zone&#8217;s policymakers and their fellow citizens.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>International rescue</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Start with the rescue plan. Its mainstay is the promise of up to &#8364;440 billion over three years from a &#8220;special-purpose vehicle&#8221; to be set up by the 16 euro-zone countries, which will control the disbursement of money and guarantee the vehicle&#8217;s financing. The scheme is open to EU countries that do not use the euro: Poland and Sweden say they will sign up to it; Britain says it will not. At Germany&#8217;s insistence the money will be raised and overseen by governments. The Germans do not want Eurocrats raising and handing out too much money without close monitoring from national capitals.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That much is plain. Further details of the scheme&#8217;s workings, however, remain sketchy. It is not clear, for instance, whether the pool will raise money in anticipation of a funding emergency or only when it is needed, which is how the balance-of-payments fund operates. The interest rate to be charged for access to funds has not been decided&#8212;a detail that delayed the Greek rescue package for weeks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The IMF has not yet spelled out the precise size and nature of its promised contribution (see ), although it seems that some finance ministers were in contact with fund officials during the late-night talks. The ministers expect the IMF to chip in &#8220;at least half as much&#8221; as European countries, just as it did for the rescue of Greece and, before that, for Latvia. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These elements of the rescue plan would take a while to become fully operational&#8212;too long, perhaps, for jittery financial markets to wait. That is what made the ECB&#8217;s participation necessary: it is the only institution that could react rapidly enough. However, the role of the central bank raises a second set of concerns.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some of these are easier to assuage than others. By buying government bonds, the ECB is pumping money into the economy. This is potentially inflationary. However, the central bank says it will soak up the cash, for instance by selling instruments of its own, so that monetary policy will not in fact be loosened. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More niggling is the suspicion that the ECB has caved in to political pressure to help out spendthrift governments. As recently as May 6th, Jean-Claude Trichet, the central bank&#8217;s president, said that the ECB&#8217;s 22-strong governing council had not even discussed buying bonds at its regular monetary-policy meeting. Four days later the bank was doing just that. Not every member of the council was happy with the change of heart, even though Mr Trichet insisted it was backed by an &#8220;overwhelming majority&#8221;. Axel Weber, the head of the Bundesbank, Germany&#8217;s central bank, and a leading candidate to succeed Mr Trichet when he steps down next year, voiced his criticism to <em>B\xF6rsen-Zeitung</em>, a German financial newspaper.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Trichet has denied that the ECB was pressured into buying bonds, saying that the central bank was &#8220;fiercely and totally independent&#8221;. Yet the ECB looks a different animal from what it was when the fiscal crisis began. Last year it balked at buying government bonds when other central banks were doing so as an emergency extension of monetary policy&#8212;ie, to hold down the interest rates at which firms and households could borrow and to get money flowing through the banking system. Now it finds itself providing explicit support for European governments&#8217; fiscal policies, which is a far bigger threat to its reputation for independence. It is influencing the borrowing costs of euro-zone governments directly, without much of a guide to what the rates on their bonds should be.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is not the only sharp U-turn Mr Trichet has had to perform recently. He opposed the IMF&#8217;s involvement in the Greek rescue, then welcomed it. And he said the central bank&#8217;s rules on what constituted acceptable collateral should not be altered to suit one country, only to change them to ensure that Greek bonds could be exchanged by banks for ECB cash. The central bank&#8217;s credibility relies in part on a reputation for living up to its pledges and partly on its disdain for political expediency. On both counts, it has lost something. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The loss need not be fatal. As one senior policymaker puts it, it is one thing to be independent of politicians but quite another to have discussions with them in a crisis. It was the flaws in the construction of the euro that forced Mr Trichet&#8217;s hand, not a lack of fortitude under political pressure. The ECB had to step in to head off the threat of a run on Irish, Portuguese and Spanish bonds (and maybe some banks) because no other euro-zone institution could do so. Equally, the ECB could scarcely refuse Greek government bonds as collateral for central-bank money even if they were junk. To do so would be to deny Greece one of the privileges of membership. It might even have been illegal. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Gouvernement \xE9conomique</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The third cause for concern is what the euro area&#8217;s governments will do with the time the rescue package buys them. Already, countries that have been dilatory in cutting their deficits have pledged to be more resolute. Portugal&#8217;s government, which clocked up a deficit of 9.4% of GDP last year, has said it will delay plans to build a new airport, to follow a recent promise of cuts in unemployment insurance. On May 12th the Spanish prime minister, Jos\xE9 Luis Rodr\xEDguez Zapatero, announced that civil servants&#8217; pay would be cut by 5% from June and frozen next year. Ministers&#8217; pay will be slashed by 15%. It is hoped that this and other measures, including a &#8364;6 billion reduction in public investment, will cut Spain&#8217;s budget deficit from 11.2% of GDP last year to just over 6% in 2011. &#8220;The situation is difficult and it would be nonsense to hide it,&#8221; said Mr Zapatero. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, keeping up the pressure on countries with big deficits may prove difficult with a safety net in place. After all, the rescue package is, in effect, an attempt by policymakers to convince investors that euro-zone sovereign debts are collectively insured: the debts of one are guaranteed by all. The idea that the &#8364;440 billion scheme will be retired after three years is hard to believe: it is difficult to withdraw a guarantee once it has been given. All governments, even that of reluctant Germany, understand that they have taken a step towards a kind of fiscal federalism. Indeed euro-zone policymakers are now scrambling to claim the plan as their own so that they can set the terms for the economic co-ordination and surveillance that it entails.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For many, the fallout from the Greek crisis has proved what they had suspected all along: that the euro zone needs more fiscal co-ordination in order to work. If its members are to underwrite each other&#8217;s debts, they will demand more say in each other&#8217;s budget plans. The stability and growth pact, the scheme that was meant to limit euro-area countries&#8217; budget deficits to 3% of GDP and public debt to 60% of GDP, has clearly failed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That still leaves Europe&#8217;s policymakers grappling with the problem of how to impose fiscal discipline. On May 12th the European Commission set out proposals for strengthening the EU&#8217;s &#8220;economic governance&#8221;. The commission said budget plans and economic reforms should be subject to peer review before they reach national parliaments. Breaches of budgetary rules should be punished faster&#8212;by withholding funds from the EU budget or by fines, placed in an interest-bearing account pending remedial action. It is easy to think of other possible sanctions but harder to work out how they could be imposed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Lax countries could be threatened with harsher terms on borrowing from pooled funds. Sinners could lose access to ECB support. The trouble is, these sorts of threats are empty as long as they impose costs on those who would dole out punishment. Fiscal surveillance in the euro area has failed because the punishers fret that one day they might be the punished, or because the strong financial links between euro-area countries mean that any punishment would undermine the currency zone&#8217;s stability.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Budgetary discipline will be only one part of euro-zone surveillance&#8212;and perhaps not the most important part. The commission also wants to monitor trade imbalances and the build-up of foreign debts. Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain have become heavily reliant on foreign capital, racking up big current-account deficits year after year (see chart 2) and hence accumulating ever larger foreign debts. Portugal is deepest in hock: its net international debt (what it owes, less its foreign assets) rose to 112% of GDP last year. Roughly half of that total was public debt. Spain, Greece and Ireland are also heavily in debt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>What makes this problem so acute is that very little of the foreign capital in these countries is greenfield direct investments, like new factories, or purchases of shares in big firms listed on stockmarkets&#8212;the kind of money that tends to stick around and can bear losses. The bulk of it is either government bonds or short-term money that has been funnelled through the banking system to fund mortgages and loans to small firms, and is more likely to disappear in a crisis. Portuguese banks&#8217; net foreign debts were around 46% of GDP last year. These credit lines need to be rolled over regularly and their price and availability depend on the creditworthiness of the government. In the fallout from the Greek crisis, the market&#8217;s confidence about Ireland, Portugal and Spain was draining away. As the yields on their government bonds rose at the end of last week, there seemed to be a real threat that foreign financing would come to a sudden halt.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dependence on foreign capital in these countries is both symptom and cause of a deeper problem: a lack of export competitiveness. Cheap foreign credit fuelled the booms in domestic demand in Greece, Spain and Ireland in the years after the euro&#8217;s launch in 1999. That pushed up unit-wage costs relative to those in the rest of the euro area (notably super-competitive Germany) and cost competitiveness declined steadily (see chart 3). Consumer booms also skewed industrial structures away from firms that export to those that serve the domestic market and are more sheltered from foreign competition. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Reversing those trends will be hard, but essential if countries are to service their foreign debts from export earnings. Devaluation, the usual route to rebalancing, is not open to countries in the euro area. They must find ways of cutting labour costs and boosting productivity. Ireland has already reduced wages; Spain made a start this week. Granted, lower wages will make mortgage debts harder to service. But the choice is between lower wages and higher unemployment, which is already in double digits in Portugal and Ireland and close to 20% in Spain. It will not be easy to dismantle Portugal&#8217;s and Spain&#8217;s complex wage-setting agreements, which set a floor to industry pay. But firms, especially small ones, should be allowed to opt out of such arrangements so that they can better match labour costs to productivity. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Export or die</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Policy should also be directed at shifting resources to exporters. One complaint in Portugal is that the monopolistic state of some service industries serves only to reinforce existing imbalances. The best graduates want to work for telephone and energy companies because they pay well, thanks to the profitability that comes from market power. The lack of competition imposes costs on firms, including exporters, which are forced to use their services; and weak competition reduces productivity more generally. That makes measures to boost competition in services all the more vital. A report on strengthening the single market by Mario Monti, a former EU commissioner, was issued on May 10th. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Tax policy can also help, where fiscal consolidation allows it. Increasing levies on spending, such as value-added taxes, while reducing taxes on jobs would shift economies away from domestic demand, mimicking a devaluation. Countries that habitually run a trade surplus (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland) need to mirror the reforms in deficit changes with policies to promote stronger domestic demand and a shift away from an emphasis on exporting industries.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The transition to a more competitive economy will be painful. Politicians have not prepared electorates for difficult times. Running up debts is fun; paying them off is not. In an ideal world, the pain of a structural-reform programme would be cushioned by an expansionary fiscal policy. That is a luxury that Spain, Portugal and the rest can no longer afford.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fall in the euro will help. It cannot help high-wage countries compete with Germany, but it gives their firms a chance against imports from outside the euro zone. Economic logic as well as market sentiment points to further euro weakness. Business cycles favour it: America&#8217;s recovery is more advanced than Europe&#8217;s. Figures released on May 12th showed that the euro-area economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter: America&#8217;s economy expanded four times as quickly.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Monetary conditions should also hold the euro down. The pressure to tighten fiscal policy in some parts of the euro area will make it hard for the ECB even to consider raising interest rates. That will weigh on the euro and will also help indebted households in Spain, Portugal and Ireland, where mortgage rates tend to track the ECB&#8217;s benchmark interest rate. The euro is still dear against the dollar on gauges such as purchasing-power parity, notwithstanding its recent slide.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The measures announced this week offer countries a chance, perhaps their last one, to put things right. There are some hopeful signs. Portugal started to introduce some modest reforms to jobs and product markets after 2005. Its economy grew by an impressive 1.7% in the year to the first quarter&#8212;about as fast as Germany&#8217;s&#8212;which suggests that its efforts to reorient itself may be paying off.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It would be wrong to conclude that, in trying to get ahead of the crisis, the euro zone&#8217;s policymakers have already gone too far. The threat that Portugal and Spain might be cut off from credit markets, triggering a meltdown in Europe&#8217;s financial system, was all too real. The rescue effort will dent the ECB&#8217;s reputation as a single-minded inflation-slayer. There is still a risk that the insurance provided by the rescue scheme may leave countries that benefit from it a bit less minded to cut deficits and reform their economies. But those faults, real as they are, must be set against the potential costs of doing nothing. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Doing the hokey-cokey</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Financial markets have been shaking it all about so far this year</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>TWO steps forward, two steps back. The financial markets have been conducting a strange dance so far in 2010. And after all that effort, by May 12th the MSCI index of global equities was virtually back where it had started the year. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The past two weeks have provided a perfect illustration of the markets&#8217; frantic footwork. An astonishingly volatile session on Wall Street on May 6th saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge by nearly 1,000 points at one stage (see ). But the announcement of the euro-zone bail-out package in the early hours of May 10th saw a violent rally, albeit one that only lasted 24 hours. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The markets&#8217; stuttering performance reflects continuing confusion about the economic environment. On the positive side, the American economy appears to be recovering well and the first-quarter results season has showed rapid profits growth. Very low short-term interest rates also encourage investors to seek higher returns by moving into risky assets such as equities and corporate bonds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are negatives to set against this picture. European economies have been disappointing (first-quarter GDP growth was just 0.2% in the euro zone). Wall Street has become more jittery thanks to the SEC&#8217;s fraud charges against Goldman Sachs and the likely shape of the financial-reform bill. And there are worries about how the steady tightening of Chinese monetary policy will affect the world&#8217;s fastest-growing big economy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Investors are also in two minds about fiscal policy. They would like governments to cut their deficits and they feared, before the European rescue package was revealed, that contagion from Greece would cause a financial crisis across the euro zone and even beyond.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But if investors want individual countries to tighten fiscal policy, they also worry about the impact of many developed countries doing so at once. As Greg Gibbs of the Royal Bank of Scotland wrote in a research note this week: &#8220;Imagine the carnage if major economies were forced from double-digit deficits to surplus, you are talking a Great Depression-type scenario or worse. Even getting close to that outcome is too bad to consider, so when borrowing costs start to rise, as they did recently in the euro-zone periphery, making borrowing difficult, the contagion spreads to equities and global asset markets.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This debate highlights a tension at the heart of the rally that started in early 2009. The economy has been bolstered by government-stimulus programmes, packages that are enormous in scope but must be temporary in nature. If the economy is rebounding as normal, is all this official support really needed? And if the support is withdrawn, how will the economy cope?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As investors have grappled with this problem, there have been days when a bunch of assets known as the &#8220;risk trade&#8221; (equities, commodities, the Australian dollar) have gone up, and other days when risk-averse investors have bought a separate basket including government bonds and the American dollar. Over the past two weeks, the risk-trade basket has had the worst of it: the Australian dollar, for example, fell by 6% against the yen in the course of just four days.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Asset-allocation decisions are becoming more complex, too. In 2008 and 2009 investors earned big money if they made the correct calls on buying equities versus corporate bonds, or on favouring mining shares, say, over financial stocks. The euro-zone crisis has emphasised that they now also need to worry more about country and currency risk. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The clearest measure of recent investor uncertainty is the VIX or volatility index, traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. In effect, this index shows the price investors are willing to pay to insure themselves against substantial market moves. Having declined pretty steadily since the middle of 2009, the index more than doubled in early May (see chart).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The only asset that has steadily inched higher in price this year has been gold, which reached a record closing price of $1,237 an ounce on May 12th. Bullion is seen as a two-way bet. It acts as a haven for risk-averse investors and as a hedge against the risk that governments will be tempted to inflate away their debts, a risk that is perceived to have increased after the European Central Bank agreed to buy euro-zone government bonds as part of this week&#8217;s rescue package. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a sense, this period of market consolidation was inevitable. Stockmarkets rose in almost a straight line from March 2009, as fears of a further meltdown in the financial sector receded and the global economy hit bottom. As a result, share-price valuations moved from being slightly cheap on the best long-term measure (the cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio) to expensive. The spread (excess interest rate) on high-yield corporate bonds has fallen from more than 16 percentage points at the start of 2009 to less than six points. <em>The Economist</em>&#8217;s own commodity-price index rose by 54% between its low at the end of 2008 and late April. Such prolonged rallies do not continue indefinitely.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Chris Watling of Longview Economics says that this is a classic &#8220;phase two&#8221; of a cyclical bull market, in which investors take stock after an initial rally. Much remains unclear about the economic and political outlook, from the likely direction of monetary and fiscal policy to the impact of additional government regulation on economic growth and profits. The slowdown in quantitative-easing programmes (under which central banks created money to buy assets) may also have deprived the markets of crucial liquidity support. It would have been more surprising if the markets had not paused for breath. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>A few minutes of mayhem</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A brief crash sparks a debate on how to reform the stockmarket</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>BEFORE May 6th equities had been seen as that rare thing, a financial market that had continued to function unimpaired through the crisis. It took just 20 minutes to shatter that image. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by nearly 1,000 points, with most of the losses occurring between 2.40pm and 3.00pm. It was the largest intra-day decline in the market&#8217;s history. Some well-known stocks, such as Accenture, a consulting firm, briefly traded for as little as a cent. The market later rebounded, to close down by 348 points, but investors remain rattled. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The search is still on for a specific trigger for what has become known as the &#8220;flash crash&#8221;. Initial rumours, among them that a trader had typed a sell order for 16 billion shares of Procter &amp; Gamble instead of 16m, have been cast aside. A confluence of factors is a likelier explanation. Anxiety over Greece&#8217;s bail-out package and the British election&#8217;s outcome, and two previous days of declines, all made investors skittish. A large bet in the stock-futures market may have contributed to the plunge. On May 11th Mary Schapiro, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), remained non-committal about the cause when she testified before Congress. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In the meantime Ms Schapiro is turning her attention to the fragmented structure and lightning speed of stockmarkets. Over the past few years trading has increasingly moved to new exchanges that allow transactions to happen more rapidly and more cheaply. In 2003 the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) handled about 80% of trading volume of its listed stocks, but by the end of 2009, that share had fallen to 25% (see chart). A good chunk has gone to upstart electronic-trading platforms, such as Direct Edge and BATS, which execute trades in milliseconds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Regulations have not kept up. &#8220;It was basically every exchange for themselves to decide whether to participate in the market as this free fall began,&#8221; says William O&#8217;Brien, the boss of Direct Edge. In an attempt to slow down trading, the NYSE decided to shut down its electronic-trading platform and trade manually via &#8220;specialists&#8221; on its floor (it is the only market in America that operates both an electronic and an &#8220;open outcry&#8221; system). But other exchanges resisted such a slowdown. What&#8217;s more, following rules introduced a couple of years ago, they refrained from routing orders through the NYSE because it was not functioning as normal. This robbed markets of a big slug of liquidity, almost certainly exacerbating the price falls. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another factor was the sudden retreat by the &#8220;high frequency&#8221; firms whose algorithmic trading has come to dominate equity markets. In normal times they play a crucial role in providing liquidity. But unlike marketmakers, they are not obliged to do so during bouts of turbulence. Regulators think that some high-frequency traders switched off their programs when prices began to spiral, fearful that their trades would be cancelled because of the severity of the declines. Manoj Narang, the boss of Tradeworx, a hedge fund with a high-frequency trading business, says he shut off when he &#8220;noticed the prices were erroneous&#8221;, because he knew exchanges would cancel those trades (as they did).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>How will regulators prevent another sudden lurch downward? The SEC has suggested a more rigorous, co-ordinated market-wide system of &#8220;circuit breakers&#8221;, which would require all exchanges to stop or slow trading for a few minutes if the market experiences a certain rate of decline. A stock-specific &#8220;circuit breaker&#8221;, which would do the same for particular shares, may also be enacted. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Reform will not end there. The struggle to make sense of the billions of trades executed on May 6th gives momentum to a proposal the SEC released in April to require large traders (those trading at least 20m shares or $200m a month) to register with it. This would make it easier for the agency to track high-frequency trading in the future. &#8220;Market orders&#8221;, which ask for a stock to be sold at the best available price without specifying a minimum&#8212;as opposed to &#8220;limit orders&#8221;, which set a floor&#8212;are also coming under fire. It only lasted minutes, but the flash crash will have consequences that last for years. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>High hopes, low returns</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Tough times for Asian markets</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | HONG KONG | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVEN in Asia, capital markets are under strain. Undone by fears of slowing growth at home and abroad, the pivotal Chinese stock exchanges have been dropping since December: Hong Kong has fallen by more than 11%, Shenzhen and Shanghai are down by more than 15%. A series of initial public offerings have been cancelled throughout the region (see table). Perhaps most significant was the cancellation on May 6th by Swire&#8217;s property arm, if only because its bosses are thought to be too smart to sell at a time of falling demand.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The deals known to have been pulled pale beside the number quietly delayed. Every investment bank in the region has a vast launch pad of potential offerings ready to go, meaning huge amounts have been invested&#8212;millions of dollars in some cases&#8212;to prepare extensive audits and associated materials for prospectuses. Some companies have stepped back because, like Swire, they can afford to be picky. Others have done so because the daily volatility has been so great that agreeing on a price has been impossible. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A third group is perhaps the most disconcerting. A handful of recent transactions have reawakened suspicions about the quality of companies coming to market. On April 15th the listing of Fujian Star-net Communication, a telecoms-equipment manufacturer, was pulled after doubts arose about the validity of its patents. On May 4th New Century Shipbuilding cancelled what was to have been the largest Chinese offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange after questions were raised about how it disclosed information on cancelled orders. Earlier this year securities regulators in Hong Kong froze in excess of $100m raised in a December public offering of Hontex International Holdings, a textiles company, while it investigated whether financial results in its prospectus were overstated.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This would matter less to investors were the returns on recent listings not so poor. One hedge fund reckons that out of the 15 significant initial offerings done this year, eight are now trading below their listing prices and most of the others are far below the peaks registered in the initial euphoria after their placement.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And yet, for all that, optimism remains. The market for bankers&#8217; services is robust. In the first half of 2009 clients would politely put off hiring candidates brought their way; now headhunters are overwhelmed with genuine assignments. Banks wanting to hire typically need to provide guaranteed compensation of at least one year, and in the case of less prestigious names, two to three years.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>And big deals continue to get done. On May 12th trading began in shares of Samsung Life, South Korea&#8217;s largest-ever public offering, which raised $4.4 billion. India&#8217;s government is on the verge of awarding banking mandates for the privatisation of Coal India, which is likely to be that country&#8217;s largest-ever offering. Mizuho, a Japanese bank, is reportedly planning to raise $11 billion in new equity. The Chinese banks are lining up for large amounts, too&#8212;perhaps $7 billion for the Bank of China, $11 billion for China Construction Bank, and, another record, $25 billion for the initial public offering of China Agricultural Bank. These are expected to go forward even if the market environment remains hostile and the Chinese government, through its numerous state-affiliated investment firms, has to buy every share. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The other vampires</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Pressure mounts on an oligopoly</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | NEW YORK | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;LIKE vampires in the dead of the night&#8221;, rating agencies &#8220;will outlast us all&#8221;, said Bill Gross of PIMCO, a fund manager, this month. The ne&#8217;er-do-wells that fuelled the mortgage crisis by overrating trillions of dollars of dodgy debt have had a relatively easy time of it recently. But the heat on the oligopoly that dominates the industry&#8212;Moody&#8217;s, Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s (S&amp;P) and Fitch&#8212;is rising.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Two recent hearings in Washington, DC, knocked their reputations further. In the first, senators aired embarrassing internal e-mails, including one in which an S&amp;P staffer berated colleagues for developing &#8220;a kind of Stockholm syndrome which they mistakenly tag as customer value creation.&#8221; The industry also played an ignominious cameo in the second hearing, on AAA-rated investments peddled by Goldman Sachs that subsequently bombed. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Investors and regulators are taking aim, too. America&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering bringing a case against Moody&#8217;s over a potentially misleading application to remain an officially recognised rating firm. CalPERS, a pension fund, has won court backing to proceed with a fraud suit against the big three, alleging &#8220;wildly inaccurate&#8221; ratings&#8212;one of three cases against the industry that have moved to the evidence-gathering stage (though a dozen other suits have been dismissed against S&amp;P alone).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Anger is seeping into the political debate. For a while it looked as though the industry would get away with a soft batch of reforms: increased disclosure, more frequent regulatory reviews, and so forth. Now it fears the inclusion of several draconian proposals in the financial-reform bill currently before America&#8217;s Senate (see ). One would lower the bar for proving fraud against rating agencies, from knowingly issuing a false opinion to merely failing to &#8220;conduct a reasonable investigation&#8221; of a rated security. The industry is also spooked by an amendment, enjoying bipartisan support, that would stop banks from choosing which agency they hire to rate a particular offering. Instead, the decision would fall to a board within the SEC, which would rotate assignments among agencies, with those whose ratings proved less accurate garnering less business. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Sentiment is also swinging against the industry in Europe, where politicians are livid at recent downgrades of sovereign debt&#8212;in Greece&#8217;s case, to junk just as officials were about to unveil a support plan. The European Commission is looking at the idea of creating a home-grown rating agency as a counterweight to the American trio. The leaders of France and Germany want a review of whether ratings should remain embedded in regulations. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That process is already under way. The SEC has eliminated some references to ratings from Depression-era laws and has proposed reducing their importance to asset-backed securities. Last year a group of state insurance regulators hired PIMCO to replace rating agencies in analysing mortgage-backed securities held by firms they oversee. This week the Bank of England, following the European Central Bank, said it would no longer be guided strictly by a government-bond&#8217;s rating when deciding whether to accept it as collateral.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Such moves may do as much to shake up the ratings business as anything headed for the statute books. But it would be rash to count the big three out. Many investors will continue to want to use them as a crutch: witness money-market funds&#8217; success in fending off proposals to reduce their reliance on ratings. And ratings will continue to play a role in determining banks&#8217; capital requirements, as ghoulish a prospect as that may seem. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Maul street</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Bit by bit, things worsen for the financial industry</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | WASHINGTON, DC | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE American Senate is supposed to bathe radical proposals in a breeze of moderation and reason. The opposite seems to be happening with the financial-reform bill. As it makes its way through the legislative process the bill has become progressively more hostile to Wall Street. Among the hundreds of amendments being proposed on the Senate floor are an even stricter ban on proprietary trading than originally envisaged, caps on debit- and credit-card &#8220;interchange&#8221; fees, higher deposit-insurance fees for big banks, and (potentially most serious of all) the imposition of fiduciary duties on marketmakers.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Many of these will not pass, but those that have are stringent. A draconian prohibition on banks operating derivatives-swaps desks was incorporated into the bill despite furious industry opposition. Blanche Lincoln, the Arkansas Democrat who first proposed the prohibition, has since clarified that bank-holding companies (like Citigroup) could still own a swaps desk, but a bank itself (like Citibank), which benefits from various federal backstops, could not. The industry is not comforted: creating a separate swaps unit within a holding company would require an additional $110 billion-$200 billion in capital, says the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Many banks would probably just give up the business. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The provision is opposed by regulators and, reportedly, by the administration. Opponents hope it will be dropped, perhaps after Ms Lincoln has beaten back a left-wing challenger to the Democratic nomination for her seat on May 18th. But the industry looks unlikely to stop the bill&#8217;s requirements to funnel derivatives trading through exchanges and clearinghouses. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another key shift has been on the &#8220;resolution authority&#8221; that is designed to allow regulators to seize a troubled financial firm and meet creditor claims while liquidating the firm in an orderly manner. Chris Dodd, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, originally proposed that the industry pay into a $50 billion fund that would cover any shortfall between a failed firm&#8217;s assets and creditors&#8217; claims. Republicans huffed that such a fund would be seen as a promise to bail out all and sundry. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Dodd has agreed to drop the fund (though the costs can be recovered after a bankruptcy) and to require regulators to recoup any benefit creditors enjoy from a bail-out. In other words, if a creditor who would have got 60 cents on the dollar in bankruptcy instead gets 100 cents, he may have to repay the 40-cent difference. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The change has vastly improved the chances that the bill will become law. It also lightens the upfront financial burden on banks. But creditors fearing only a partial recovery may be more tempted to yank their money before a troubled firm is seized, risking the very collapse the resolution authority aims to prevent. Against that, the bill does spare fully secured creditors from the recouping process.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The banks are not the only institutions in the line of fire. On May 11th an amendment subjecting the Federal Reserve&#8217;s emergency lending during the crisis to a one-time congressional audit was approved. The disclosure of which of the nation&#8217;s largest banks got how much from the Fed will no doubt provoke more outrage (even if the Fed got every penny back, plus interest). Still, the provision was watered down from its original requirement that emergency loans and monetary policy both undergo regular audits, which would have undermined the Fed&#8217;s independence. And a separate amendment lets the Fed keep oversight of some small banks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Democrats hope the Senate will pass the bill in the next week or so. Differences with a parallel bill in the House of Representatives will then have to be ironed out. Even then, Wall Street cannot rest easy. On May 11th the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation passed a requirement that banks retain a portion of loans that they securitise. It is not just Congress that is bent on corralling finance. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>The fear of all sums</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>The role of mathematics in America&#8217;s housing bust</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IN HINDSIGHT one of the worst things about America&#8217;s subprime housing bust is how predictable it was. Subprime borrowers were by definition people of limited means with poor credit histories. Yet economists who have looked at the pattern of payments on subprime mortgages point out that even when house prices topped out and then began to fall, not all subprime borrowers defaulted. Only a minority of borrowers abruptly ceased to make payments, as someone choosing to default would.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>More typically, payments went from being regular to being erratic: borrowers fell behind, then became current again, only to fall behind once more. Those patterns are indicative of people trying, but struggling, to keep up with their payments. A trio of economists set out to find out what differentiated those borrowers who did not keep up with their payments from the rest. Their answer, according to a new working paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is simple: numeracy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The economists tracked down a large number of subprime borrowers in New England on whom they already had detailed information, including the terms of their mortgages and their repayment histories. These borrowers were then subjected to a series of questions that required simple calculations about percentages and interest rates*. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Even accounting for a host of differences between people&#8212;including attitudes to risk, income levels and credit scores&#8212;those who fell behind on their mortgages were noticeably less numerate than those who kept up with their payments in the same overall circumstances. The least numerate fell behind about 25% of the time. For those who did best on the test, the number of payments they missed was almost 12%. A fifth of the least numerate group had been in foreclosure, but only 7% of those who were more numerically adept had.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Surprisingly, the least numerate were not making loan choices that differed much from their peers. They were about as likely to have a fixed-rate mortgage as the more numerically able. They did not borrow a larger share of their income. And loans were about the same fraction of the house&#8217;s value.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Stephan Meier, one of the study&#8217;s authors, reckons that the innumerate may be worse at managing their daily finances, leaving them with little room for manoeuvre when things get difficult. Those better at sums might, for instance, have put a bit more aside in more plentiful times. Normally, such differences might not matter much. But in bleaker circumstances, a small pot of savings may be all that stands between homeownership and foreclosure. </p>\r\n\

    <h1>High stakes</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>What has the fund got itself into by participating in Europe&#8217;s bail-out?</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE IMF&#8217;s star has risen steadily through the global economic crisis. Contributions from its members have tripled its firepower. It has rescued economies from Hungary to Pakistan. Yet despite these achievements, its activities did not extend into the heart of the rich world. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is now changing. Although initially sidelined by the European Union (EU), the IMF eventually cofunded and devised the terms of Greece&#8217;s massive bail-out. And on May 10th the EU announced that the IMF is to provide up to &#8364;250 billion ($317 billion) to supplement its own &#8364;500 billion stabilisation fund to prop up the euro area&#8217;s weaker members. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But the details of the IMF&#8217;s promised contribution are far from clear. The fund is keen to emphasise that no money has actually been set aside for the rescue. Its deputy chief, John Lipsky, stresses that the &#8364;250 billion figure is &#8220;a hypothetical or theoretical number&#8221; based on the fund&#8217;s role in recent joint EU-IMF rescues, where the IMF has provided about a third of the cash on offer. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The amount is hypothetical for a very good reason. Having to set that amount aside immediately would leave the IMF unable to lend to any other country that got into trouble. As of May 6th, its total remaining lending capacity for the year ahead was $272 billion, or &#8364;215 billion. It has never lent as much in one go as it would if the euro-area package were to be activated in its entirety (see chart). </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fund could, of course, find more money. Its board recently approved an extension of its standing arrangements to borrow from governments and central banks by more than $500 billion. But about half that amount is already included in its current lending capacity. Activating the rest would require many governments to seek legislative approval. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>There are other options. The IMF will get some extra cash at the end of the year from a general increase in quotas, the maximum amounts countries are obliged to supply to the fund. Last year it also issued $250 billion of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), its own quasi-currency. These sit in countries&#8217; reserves in proportion to their quotas. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the fund&#8217;s chief, thinks countries could lend some of this money to others. But there is no precedent for SDRs being transferred on such a massive scale.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The fund could also approach some reserve-rich emerging countries to top up its kitty. Some have already lent to the fund. China bought $50 billion of notes the fund issued last year; Brazil, Russia and India each bought $10 billion. But some of these countries are miffed that the fund did not consult them before rushing to the rescue of the euro area. Emerging Asian economies have bitter memories of the harsh conditions the IMF imposed on them during the Asian crisis; they are concerned about the fund making a huge commitment of resources without clearly setting out what potential borrowers would have to do to get the money. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Eswar Prasad, a former chief of the fund&#8217;s China desk, says that all this is once again leading to questions about &#8220;whether the IMF&#8217;s ultimate fealty is to its main shareholders, the US and the EU&#8221;. Such concerns repeatedly arise because European countries as a group have the biggest chunk of votes in the IMF, and are over-represented relative to their economic heft.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Some also wonder whether the political ambitions of Mr Strauss-Kahn, who is widely rumoured to be considering a run for the French presidency, were behind the IMF&#8217;s eagerness to step in. Simon Johnson, once the fund&#8217;s chief economist, says that &#8220;a former French finance minister is the worst possible person to be leading the IMF into negotiations designed to save the euro. The conflicts of interest are overwhelming.&#8221; The fund&#8217;s European adventures may help Mr Strauss-Kahn. Their consequences for the institution he heads are less clear. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>From ships to bits</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Common carriage is an ancient idea being applied to a modern problem&#8212;internet access</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>IT SOUNDS like the most modern of regulatory problems. All internet services involve shipping bits of digital information from one computer to another. These bits are gathered into packets and sent as electrical signals down phone wires or cable networks (which can be pretty fast) or as pulses of light along optical fibres (which is faster still). Stringing wires or laying cables is expensive, so a company that owns a connection that runs to the side of your house&#8212;the so-called &#8220;last mile&#8221;&#8212;has tremendous power over potential rivals. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>On May 6th America&#8217;s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced a plan to classify the last mile of internet access as a &#8220;telecommunications service&#8221;; it is currently classified as an &#8220;information service&#8221;. Since the 1930s providers of telecommunications services in America have been obliged to agree on rates with the FCC. They cannot discriminate among customers or traffic, and they have to contribute to a fund that subsidises rural connections. The new plan promises to refrain from any price regulation; the FCC wants to ensure primarily that packets pass from point to point without preferential treatment. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most large telecoms operators are unhappy with the plan. It will discourage innovation and investment in expensive new networks, they say, and a telephone-era solution is unfit for the internet. They are wrong on at least one count. The FCC&#8217;s decision rests on the idea of &#8220;common carriage&#8221;, a principle that is, in fact, far older than the telephone.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Excerpts from Justinian&#8217;s &#8220;Digest&#8221; of Roman law suggest that 6th-century sea captains, innkeepers and liverymen could not refuse board to any cargo, man or horse. William Blackstone, in his 18th-century &#8220;Commentaries on the Laws of England&#8221;, was more explicit: to open a house for travellers implied &#8220;an engagement to entertain all persons who travel that way&#8221;. English common law came to see innkeepers, boatmen, warehouse owners and granary operators as &#8220;common carriers&#8221;: transport trades compelled to serve all comers, and to charge reasonable rates.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a 2002 paper James Speta of Northwestern University laid out three broad historical justifications for applying common carriage to regulate prices and access. First, many transporters enjoy a natural or state-granted monopoly and need to be restrained from exercising it with too much abandon. A medieval innkeeper, for example, often offered the only lodging in town; a boatman could cross only with the king&#8217;s writ. Second, the state sometimes offers favours of its own to transporters&#8212;public lands and roads, say, or the seizure of private property to make way for new infrastructure&#8212;and expects a certain level of public service in return. Third, transport is essential to commerce. It represents an input cost to almost all businesses, and to restrict access or overcharge is to burden the entire economy.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>All these arguments applied in spades to 19th-century rail. Like a medieval town&#8217;s sole inn, a railway line is a perfect example of a natural monopoly: it is tremendously expensive to build and it is difficult to justify more than one set of tracks on any route just to guarantee competition. In 1887 Congress designated rail a common-carrier service. Railways had to offer reasonable rates and conditions on any cargo. A series of amendments imposed mandatory interconnection, a new obligation for common carriers that would prove important in future.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Telegraph lines presented a similar economic challenge&#8212;high start-up capital and low marginal operating costs. American states in the late 19th century treated telegraph lines as common carriers, obliging them to carry dispatches from any person and from any other line at consistent rates. In 1910 the federal regulator responsible for rail took on the new service of telephony. And in 1934 Congress created a new agency, the FCC, and handed it the telephone lines and the formal concept of a telecommunications service, with language lifted wholesale from existing rail legislation. The copper telephone line that ran to every house was regulated as a common carrier. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Unstiffen the fibres</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Then came the internet. At first, consumers reached the internet through a call over a telephone line to an internet-service provider. Because the local loop of telephone copper was already a common carrier, it was open to any internet-service provider (ISP). As the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University laid out in a study commissioned last year by the FCC, over the past decade almost all developed countries have extended some kind of common-carrier arrangement to broadband access. France and Britain, for example, required their former monopoly telephone companies to make their physical infrastructure available to rival ISPs, which rent it at regulated rates and compete on price and speed. The study found evidence that these &#8220;open access&#8221; policies had the effect of driving prices down and speeds up.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Telecoms operators argue that America does not need common carriage for internet access, because the country&#8217;s unique network of local cable monopolies competes against its last-mile copper-wire monopolies. True, the promise of high returns has encouraged Verizon, a telecoms giant, to build fibre networks in some densely populated areas without government subsidy. But in practice America&#8217;s regulatory approach has left much of the country with a cable monopoly for truly fast broadband access. The single largest reason given for failing to purchase broadband access in America is price, and many non-adopters are stymied by hardware fees, a lack of billing transparency and the extra cost of bundled services that providers often add to internet access. The FCC&#8217;s current plan&#8212;to ask last-mile providers to subsidise rural service, and to ensure equal treatment of packets of information&#8212;is a mild intervention by global standards. America&#8217;s modern-day common carriers should count themselves lucky. </p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>Light without logic</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Optical devices are finally going inside computers, but only in parts</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>&#8220;GOD is light&#8221;, says the Bible. Light is also a source of inspiration in computing. Ever since the first optical transistors were developed in the late 1980s, researchers have dreamed of building a light-powered computer, radiating with knowledge. Yet this breakthrough has proved elusive. Now, however, new developments mean that optical technologies are starting to appear inside computers. The all-optical computer remains a dream, but selected components that can work with light will make their way into computers ever more deeply.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is easy to see the attraction of replacing electrons, which travel along copper wires and make today&#8217;s computers tick, with photons. These particles of light are the fastest things in the universe, so an optical computer could theoretically process information at speeds that make even a supercomputer look glacial. So far, however, optical technology has been confined mostly to telecoms networks and some of the cabling in data centres. Photons are ideal for piping information over long distances. They whizz through optical fibres, rarely getting lost or interfering with one another (which is why different coloured signals can be sent down a single fibre, to multiply its capacity).</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But at each end of the fibre, optical signals must be converted to and from the electrical signals that computers use to process information. The components that do such conversion are expensive. This does not matter in a network, where costs can be spread among many users. But this expense has kept optical data-links from being used inside personal computers and servers. That is now changing because computer systems are outrunning their electrical wiring. Peripheral devices like printers, hard drives and screens are getting more demanding; networks are running faster and, most importantly, the power of processors continues to increase exponentially. The so-called &#8220;interconnects&#8221; between all these components are struggling to keep up. It is in this area where a number of new optical alternatives are emerging from some of the biggest firms in the business.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>Data in a flash</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>One of these new interconnects, called Light Peak, has been developed by Intel. It is being used to give ordinary PCs the ability to connect with other devices using high-speed optical cables at ten gigabits per second&#8212;20 times faster than a standard USB cable. This means the cable could drive a high-definition display or transfer a movie in seconds. Light Peak, predicts Mario Paniccia, the head of Intel&#8217;s photonics lab, will make optical connections as pervasive as wireless ones&#8212;and drive demand for more powerful processors, which explains Intel&#8217;s interest.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Intel did not have to invent anything new, but it did have to work out how to make small, cheap versions of the converters that turn electrical signals into light and vice versa. Having developed a simplified, low-cost chip to do the job, Intel also devised ways to assemble and test the components quickly, and signed up a group of suppliers to churn them out by the million, starting next year.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s concern is keeping its servers competitive: their cabling is getting bulkier, and data centres are becoming much harder to cool and increasingly energy hungry. So it is developing an optical replacement for the interconnects in server &#8220;racks&#8221;. Instead of optical fibre, HP is using waveguides&#8212;small strips of plastic with grooves on their highly reflective metallic walls. Again, using this technology to transmit light is not a new thing, but HP&#8217;s researchers have managed to cut costs by making waveguides with an injection-moulding system similar to that used to mass-produce CDs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Over at IBM, researchers are using optical interconnects to make supercomputers run faster. To speed up the flow of data, electrons need to be turned into photons &#8220;as close as possible to where the signal is processed&#8221;, explains Bert Offrein of IBM Research. For this reason, it is mounting fibre-optic cables straight onto the chips that direct the traffic between a supercomputer&#8217;s multiple processors.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The idea of using similar optical interconnects between a computer&#8217;s various components is, based on existing technology, not something that is about to appear in humble home or office PCs any time soon. It is hard to make such components small and cheap enough to compete with copper wiring. But one technology that does show promise in making such connections is called &#8220;silicon photonics&#8221;. It uses similar methods to those employed to manufacture processors and other types of integrated circuits.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Conveniently, silicon is not a bad material for making optical devices. Researchers at HP Labs recently managed to etch a pattern into a flat piece of silicon so that it could focus light &#8220;like a spoon&#8221;, says Raymond Beausoleil of HP Labs. This effect, he says, could be used to improve lasers and replace expensive lenses in DVD players and other consumer products.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>For its part, IBM has used silicon to develop a fast and extremely thin photodetector to convert optical signals into electrical ones. And Intel has come up with an entire kit of tiny optical devices made of silicon, which it hopes one day to combine on optical chips, such as waveguides and lasers. But one vital building block is missing from Intel&#8217;s kit: an optical equivalent of the transistors that perform the logical operations at the heart of a computer.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This missing bit does not surprise David Miller of the Photonics Research Centre at Stanford University. Optical transistors, he says, will have a hard time competing with electrical ones, not least because there is no agreement over the best way to build them. Various techniques for making optical transistors regularly appear in laboratories. But using light to process information is tricky, requires exotic materials and lasers that demand more power than conventional transistors. Moreover, miniaturisation is not straightforward, not least because lasers cannot be made as small as transistors. So mass-produced optical processors remain far off. But at least the other bits are on the way.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h1>To catch a thief</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A new way to scan digital videos for copyright infringement</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | TOKYO | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>ONLINE video piracy is a big deal. Google&#8217;s YouTube, for example, is being sued for more than $1 billion by Viacom, a media company. But it is extremely hard to tell if a video clip is copyrighted, particularly since 24 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Now a new industry standard promises to be able to identify pirated material with phenomenal accuracy in a matter of seconds. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The technique, developed by NEC, a Japanese technology company, and later tweaked by Mitsubishi Electric, has been adopted by the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) for MPEG-7, the latest standard for describing audio-visual content. The two existing methods do not do a very good job. One is digital &#8220;watermarking,&#8221; in which a bit of computer code is embedded in a file to identify it. This works only if content owners take the trouble to affix the watermark&#8212;and then it only spots duplicates, not other forms of piracy such as recording a movie at a cinema. A second approach is to extract a numeric code or &#8220;digital fingerprint&#8221; from the content file itself by comparing, say, the colours or texture of regions in a frame. But this may not work if the file is altered, such as by cropping or overlaying text.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NEC&#8217;s technology extracts a digital signature that works even if the video is altered. It does this by comparing the brightness in 380 predefined &#8220;regions of interest&#8221; in a frame of the video. This could be done for all or only some of the frames in a film. The brightness is assigned a value: -1, 0, or +1. These values are encapsulated in a digital signature of 76 bytes per frame.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The beauty of the technique is that it encompasses both granularity and generality. The 380 regions of interest are numerous, so an image can be identified even if it is doctored. At the same time, the array of three values simplifies the complexity in the image, so even if a video is of poor quality or a different hue, the information about its relative luminance is retained. Moreover, the compact signature is computationally easy to extract and use.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>NEC says the system could be used to automate what is currently a manual procedure of checking that video uploaded to the internet is not pirated. The technology is said to have an average detection rate of 96% and a low rate of false alarms: a mere five per million, according to tests by the ISO. It can detect if a video is pirated from clips as short as two seconds. And an ordinary PC can be used with the system to scour through 1,000 hours of video in a second. There are other potential uses too, because it provides a way to identify video content. A person could, say, use the signature in a clip to search for a full version of a movie. Piracy will still flourish&#8212;but the pirates may have to get smarter.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Wonderful life goes on</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>A famous fauna vanished with a whimper, not a bang</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>SOME discoveries are so unusual it takes years, decades and sometimes centuries to understand their full significance. One such discovery is the fossil bed known as the Burgess Shale, which contains a record of bizarre creatures that lived 505m years ago. It was discovered in the Canadian Rockies over a century ago and was popularised in 1989 in a book, &#8220;Wonderful Life&#8221;, by Stephen Jay Gould, an American palaeontologist. It has long been believed that the curious fauna that lived there vanished in a series of extinctions because the fossil record ends. But that no longer appears to be the case.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The Burgess Shale came soon after a period of time known as the Cambrian explosion, when most major groups of complex animals arose over a surprisingly short period. Before 560m years ago, most living things were either individual cells or simple colonies of cells. Then, and for reasons that remain a mystery, life massively diversified and became ever more complex as the rate of evolution increased. An unusual feature of the Burgess Shale is that it is one of the earliest fossil beds to contain impressions of the soft parts of animals. One of palaeontology&#8217;s dirty little secrets is that fossils are not so much a record of past life, as a record of hard-bodied past life&#8212;the things that have bones and shells. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although the fossil bed was discovered on a mountain, when these animals were alive they dwelt under an ocean, the bed of which was later thrust up to create the Rockies. Nobody knows exactly why they were so well preserved. One possibility is that the creatures were buried quickly and in conditions that were hostile to the decomposition of soft body parts by bacteria. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Those that first worked on the Burgess Shale, unearthing 65,000 specimens over a 14-year period up to 1924, assumed that the fossils came from extinct members of groups of animals in existence today. This turned out to be misleading because many of the creatures are so unusual that they are still difficult to classify. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><em>Opabinia</em>, for example, grew to about 8cm (3 inches), had five eyes, a body that was a series of lobes, a fan-shaped tail and ate using a long proboscis. The proboscis had a set of grasping claws on the end, which were used to grab food and stuff it into <em>Opabinia</em>&#8217;s mouth. <em>Nectocaris</em>, meanwhile, looked a little bit like a leech, with fins and tentacles. Weirdest of all was <em>Hallucigenia</em>, described by Simon Conway Morris, of the University of Cambridge. With its multiplicity of spines and tentacles, little about <em>Hallucigenia </em>made sense. Like an abstract painting, at first nobody could work out which way up it went, which hole food went into and which hole food came out of. (The picture on the previous page shows what is currently believed to be the correct orientation.) </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Palaeontologists had long thought that many of the Burgess Shale animals are examples of experiments in evolution. In other words, entirely new forms of life that did not survive or lead to other groups or species. <em>Hallucigenia</em>, ironically, turned out to be the exception that proved the rule. It is now thought to be an ancestor of the modern group of arthropods, which includes everything with a hard exoskeleton, from flies and butterflies to centipedes and crabs. Many other strange creatures turn out to be familiar faces in disguise.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now another misconception has been quashed. Writing in <em>Nature</em>, Peter Van Roy of Yale University and his colleagues suggest that the sudden absence of such crazy soft-bodied fossils does not indicate a mass extinction, but merely an end to the unusual local circumstances that caused the creatures to be preserved. In an area of the Atlas Mountains of Morocco the researchers have found another diverse (and sometimes bizarre) assemblage of soft-bodied organisms from a period not long after the Burgess Shale. One discovery includes something that may be a stalked barnacle. This suggests that the evolution of such complex life went on uninterrupted. For its part, the Burgess Shale continues to produce an astonishing array of indefinable creatures faster than palaeontologists can examine them. The world still has plenty to learn about this wonderful life.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <h1>Infectious personalities</h1>\r\n\
    <h2>Social networks catch an early glimpse of disease outbreaks</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>CHANCES are your friends are more popular than you are. It is a basic feature of social networks that has been known about for some time. Consider both an avid cocktail party hostess with hundreds of acquaintances and a grumpy misanthrope, who may have one or two friends. Statistically speaking, the average person is much more likely to know the hostess simply because she has so many more friends. This, in essence, is what is called the &#8220;friendship paradox&#8221;: the friends of any random individual are likely to be more central to the social web than the individual himself. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now researchers think this seemingly depressing fact can be made to work as an early warning system to detect outbreaks of contagious diseases. By studying the friends of a randomly selected group of individuals, epidemiologists can isolate those people who are more connected to one another and are therefore more likely to catch diseases like the flu early. This could allow health authorities to spot outbreaks weeks in advance of current surveillance methods.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In a report just posted on arXiv, an online repository of research papers, and which has been submitted to the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, Nicholas Christakis from Harvard University and James Fowler from the University of California, San Diego put the friendship paradox to good use. In a trial carried out last autumn, they monitored the spread of both seasonal flu and H1N1, popularly known as swine flu, through students and their friends at Harvard University.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Dr Christakis and Dr Fowler selected a random group of 319 undergraduates and asked each to nominate up to three friends. Using these names, they collected another group of 425 friends. As the friend paradox predicts, the second group were both more popular (named more times by the random group) and more central to the connections among Harvard students. Flu infections were monitored from September 1st 2009 to the end of December by identifying those diagnosed by the university&#8217;s health services and by e-mail responses to a twice-weekly health survey. Overall, 8% of the students were formally diagnosed with the flu and 32% were self-diagnosed. But the infection rate peaked two weeks earlier among the group of more-connected friends. Their social links were indeed causing them to get infected sooner. </p>\r\n\
    <h2>Early warning</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As this result came with the benefit of hindsight, the researchers tried to come up with a real-time measure that could potentially provide an early warning sign of an outbreak as it began to spread. To do this they went back to the beginning and compared diagnoses between the two groups on a daily basis for each of the 122 days of the study. A significant difference between the two groups was first detectable a full 46 days before visits to health services peaked for the random group. For those with self-reported symptoms, there was a noticeable difference 83 days before the peak in self-reported symptoms.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>These early results are impressive. Currently, the methods used to assess an infection by America&#8217;s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention lag an outbreak by a week or two. Google&#8217;s Flu Trends, which monitors millions of queries submitted to the giant search engine for the occurrence of flu-related keywords, is at best contemporaneous with an outbreak. Dr Christakis and Dr Fowler suggest that a hybrid method might be developed in which the search queries of a group of highly connected (ie, popular) individuals could be scanned for signs of the flu.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Although the technique has so far only been demonstrated for the flu and in the social milieu of a university, the researchers nevertheless think that it could help predict other infectious diseases and do so on a larger scale, such as in cities and across regions. Nor should it be difficult to implement. Public-health officials already conduct random sampling, so getting the participants to name a few friends too should not be onerous. When it comes to infectious diseases, your friends really do say a lot about you.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p><strong>The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves. </strong>By Matt Ridley. H<em>arper; 448 pages; $26.99. Fourth Estate; \xA320. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THIRTY years ago, Julian Simon and Paul Ehrlich entered into a famous bet. Mr Simon, a libertarian, was sceptical of the gloomy claims made by Mr Ehrlich, an ecologist best known for his predictions of environmental chaos and human suffering that would result from the supposed &#8220;population bomb&#8221;. Thumbing his nose at such notions as resource scarcity, Mr Simon wagered that the price of any five commodities chosen by Mr Ehrlich would go down over the following decade. The population bomb was defused, and Mr Simon handily won the bet.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Now, Matt Ridley has a similarly audacious bet in mind. A well-known British science writer (and former <em>Economist</em> journalist), Mr Ridley has taken on the mantle of rational optimism from the late Mr Simon. In his new book, he challenges those nabobs of negativity who argue that the world cannot possibly feed 9 billion mouths, that Africa is destined to fail and that the planet is heading for a climate disaster. He boldly predicts that in 2110, a much bigger world population could enjoy more and better food produced on less land than is used by farming today&#8212;and even return lots of farmland to wilderness.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>However, mankind cannot hope to achieve this if it turns its back on innovation. Feeding another 2 billion people or more will, of course, mean producing much more food. Genetically modified (GM) agriculture could play an important role, as this technology can greatly increase yields while using smaller inputs of fertiliser, insecticide and water. Many years of field experience in the Americas and Asia have shown GM crops to be safe, but, Mr Ridley rightly complains, the Luddites of the green and organic movements continue to obstruct progress.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The progress (and occasional retardation) of innovation is the central theme of Mr Ridley&#8217;s sweeping work. He starts by observing that humans are the only species capable of innovation. Other animals use tools, and some ants, for example, do specialise at certain tasks. But these skills are not cumulative, and the animals in question do not improve their technologies from generation to generation. Only man innovates continuously.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Why should that be? Some have suggested that perhaps it is the chemistry of big brains that leads us to tinker. Others that man&#8217;s mastery of language or his capacity for imitation and social learning hold the key. Mr Ridley, a zoologist by training, weighs up these arguments but insists, in the end, that the explanation lies not within man&#8217;s brain but outside: innovation is a collective phenomenon. The way man&#8217;s collective brain grows, he says cheekily, is by &#8220;ideas having sex&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>His own theory is, in a way, the glorious offspring that would result if Charles Darwin&#8217;s ideas were mated with those of Adam Smith. Trade, Mr Ridley insists, is the spark that lit the fire of human imagination, as it made possible not only the exchange of goods, but also the exchange of ideas. Trade also encouraged specialisation, since it rewarded individuals and communities who focus on areas of comparative advantage. Such specialists, in contrast with their generalist rivals or ancestors, had the time and the incentive to develop better methods and technologies to do their tasks.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is this culture of continuous improvement, which was only accelerated by the industrial revolution, that explains the astonishing improvements in the human condition over time. Through most of history, most people lived lives of quiet desperation, humiliating servitude and grinding poverty. And yet, despite the pessimistic proclamations of Mr Ehrlich and many other pundits, economic growth and technological progress have come to the rescue over and over again.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The visible hand</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As Mr Simon did in his classic work, &#8220;It&#8217;s Getting Better all the Time&#8221; (2000), Mr Ridley provides ample statistical evidence here to show that life has indeed got better for most people in most places on most measures. Whether one counts air and water pollution in California or vaccination rates in Bangladesh or life expectancy in Japan, his conclusion is indisputable. It does, however, highlight one of the book&#8217;s minor flaws: an over-anxious cramming in of too many obscure statistics and calculations that should have been relegated to footnotes or an annex. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Another is the author&#8217;s slightly unfair attitude towards government. Mr Ridley makes it abundantly clear that he is a free marketeer, and he provides ample evidence from history that governments are often incompetent and anti-innovation: &#8220;The list of innovations achieved by the pharaohs is as thin as the list of innovations achieved by British Rail or the US Postal Service.&#8221; He is particularly suspicious of strong governments, which he equates with monopolies&#8212;and those, he insists, &#8220;always grow complacent, stagnant and self-serving.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He is right that the leaden hand of the state has often suppressed individual freedom and creativity. However, he does not fully acknowledge that some problems do, in fact, require government intervention&#8212;especially because markets themselves can sometimes fail spectacularly. Mr Ridley surely knows this, as he was forced to resign as non-executive chairman of Northern Rock, the first British bank to be rescued by the government during the financial crisis. Yet the most he will say about that affair is that he is now mistrustful of markets in capital and assets, but unflinchingly in favour of markets in goods and services.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Ridley is also generally sceptical about global warming, and worries that government policies advocated by greens today will be like treating a nosebleed by putting a tourniquet around one&#8217;s neck. He argues that the problem, if it exists, will be solved by bottom-up innovation in energy technologies. But to accomplish that, he wants governments to &#8220;enact a heavy carbon tax, and cut payroll taxes.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>That is a sensible prescription (often advocated by this newspaper), but surely a &#8220;heavy&#8221; tax suggests there is a role for government in fixing market failures? He glosses too over the vital role that air-quality regulations played in cleaning up smog in California, choosing to focus instead on the inventions&#8212;like the catalytic converter and low-sulphur fuel&#8212;that arose as a result of those technology-forcing measures.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Still, he is on the mark with the big things. &#8220;The bottom-up world is to be the great theme of this century,&#8221; declares Mr Ridley in the closing pages of this sunny book. He is surely right. Thanks to the liberating forces of globalisation and Googlisation, innovation is no longer the preserve of technocratic elites in ivory towers. It is increasingly an open, networked and democratic endeavour.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>If man really can find a way of harnessing the innovative capacity of 9 billion bright sparks, then the audacious prediction about feeding the much hungrier world of 2110 using less land than today may very well be proven right too. After all, man&#8217;s greatest asset is his ability to harness that one natural resource that remains infinite in quantity: human ingenuity.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Imperfectionists. </strong>By Tom Rachman. <em>Dial Press; 272 pages; $25. Quercus; \xA316.99. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>FOR younger readers, stories about newspapers in their heyday may have a whiff of industrial archaeology, akin to tales about whaling or steam trains. Tom Rachman&#8217;s first novel is set in Rome, on a once-mighty American-owned international newspaper, surely quite unlike the (Paris-based) <em>International Herald Tribune</em>, where he used to work. The book links together 11 characters, each sharply drawn in a separate chapter. Read singly, each would be a good short story. Together they make an excellent novel.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The opening picture is of the paper&#8217;s elderly Paris correspondent, whose skills as a hack have deserted him after a lifetime of dissolution. The last is of the drippy scion of the once-formidable founding family, who fails even to announce the paper&#8217;s closure properly. In between comes an agonisingly incompetent new freelance correspondent in Cairo, a memorably ferocious pedant who guards the paper&#8217;s prose and accuracy, and the paper&#8217;s most loyal reader, an Italian <em>nobildonna</em> who, Miss Havisham-like, prefers ancient editions of the paper to the up-to-date issues.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Most of the characters have interestingly unhappy love lives, with neat twists to their betrayals and disappointments. Though bleakly portrayed, they still attract the reader&#8217;s sympathy, not least for their precarious, ill-paid jobs and filthy working conditions (the office carpets not cleaned since 1977, according to the paper&#8217;s lore). One longs for them to leave and get proper jobs.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Novels about journalism by journalists tend to be strong on score-settling and colour, but rarely survive the feuds they describe. Mr Rachman&#8217;s escapes that category. Though it lacks the transcendent absurdity of Evelyn Waugh&#8217;s &#8220;Scoop&#8221; (1938), it could sit well on a bookshelf next to Michael Frayn&#8217;s &#8220;Towards the End of the Morning&#8221; (1967), which so vividly captured the feel of the old newspaper industry in the 1960s, on the brink of its television-led transformation into the power and prestige of the &#8220;media&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This novel describes the final echoes of the newspaper story: dedication and ambition fighting a losing battle against backbiting and cheeseparing, and ending in a largely unlamented closure. Readers will look forward to Mr Rachman&#8217;s next novel. They may hope he picks a more cheerful theme.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>Iran and the CIA: The Fall of Mossadeq Revisited. </strong>By Darioush Bayandor. <em>Palgrave Macmillan; 272 pages; $33 and \xA320. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DARIOUSH BAYANDOR&#8217;S account of the toppling of Muhammad Mossadeq, Iran&#8217;s charismatic prime minister of the early 1950s, is ruffling expatriate Iranians. A Persian translation will doubtless follow, adding to the clamour. Iranians recall with anguish this episode in their history, when a democratically elected nationalist took on Britain and America and lost. Many link their subsequent political travails, including the 1979 Islamic revolution, to this early defeat. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mossadeq nationalised the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951, denting British prestige and prompting fears, especially in America, that his unstable premiership would pave the way for a communist takeover. The putsch that unseated him in August 1953 was carried out in the name of Shah Muhammad-Reza Pahlavi, but the whole seedy plot, it later emerged, had been hatched by the CIA. In 2000, Madeleine Albright, then the American secretary of state, turned the affair into an instrument of mortification, publicly rueing her compatriots&#8217; role in the overthrow of Iran&#8217;s &#8220;popular&#8221; prime minister.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>To judge by his book, Mr Bayandor would rather she hadn&#8217;t. The author, a former diplomat in the pre-Khomeini government who went on to work for the United Nations before retiring to Switzerland, does not go as far as the shah and his entourage, who presented Mossadeq&#8217;s overthrow as a patriotic uprising in no need of a foreign impetus. But he casts doubt on one account of events that was penned by the main CIA plotter, Kermit Roosevelt, a buccaneering grandson of Theodore Roosevelt. Far from snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, as Roosevelt claimed to have done, Mr Bayandor says he and his local assets were largely observers as a constellation of indigenous forces brought Mossadeq down.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Much hinges on the four days that followed the failed coup of August 15th, which, Mr Bayandor admits, was masterminded by Roosevelt. With American plans in disarray, the shah scuttled off to Rome and Mossadeq came under pressure to declare a republic. According to the received wisdom, Roosevelt and his co-conspirators organised a group of army officers to launch a second, successful coup on August 19th, and American dollars were used to bribe crowds to pour onto the streets, giving them cover to act.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Bayandor contests these assumptions. The armed forces, he asserts, acted without American prompting. The CIA &#8220;bribe&#8221; was a non-event. Mr Bayandor&#8217;s scepticism is a useful antidote to Roosevelt&#8217;s self-aggrandising, which some later writers have mimicked uncritically, among them Stephen Kinzer, a former <em>New York Times</em> reporter, who in 2003 penned an entertaining account of Mossadeq&#8217;s downfall. But the claim over bribes has been contradicted by Marc Gasiorowski, the leading historian of the American side of the coup, who interviewed some of the bribe-givers. All in all, Mr Bayandor&#8217;s account may be over-reliant on one of the last surviving coup-makers, Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the general who seized the premiership after Mossadeq&#8217;s arrest, who resists depictions of his father as an American stooge.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>It is helpful to be reminded that history often needs re-examining. Mr Bayandor might have cast his revisionist net even wider. Some accounts have been too glib in portraying Mossadeq as a democratic paragon when his instinct was to concentrate power in his hands, glossing over his failure to negotiate a solution to the nationalisation crisis when there was still an opportunity to do so.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Mr Bayandor is less wise to dismiss another axiom out of hand: that the 1953 coup, by removing the last effective stay on the shah&#8217;s power, led indirectly to Ayatollah Khomeini&#8217;s 1979 revolution. Only after Mossadeq&#8217;s ejection was the shah able to become a high-octane dictator, though the ousted prime minister had the last laugh with a courtroom performance that undermined the shah&#8217;s pretensions to justice and benevolence. In destroying Mossadeq (who died in internal exile in 1967), the shah robbed liberal Iranians of their natural figurehead. They have been looking for a replacement ever since.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p><strong>The Great Brain Race: How Global Universities Are Reshaping the World. </strong>By Ben Wildavsky. <em>Princeton University Press; 248 pages; $26.95 and \xA318.95. </em>Buy from , </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p></p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE word &#8220;globalisation&#8221; usually conjures up images of globe-spanning companies and distance-destroying technologies. The Rupert Murdochs and Lloyd Blankfeins of this world are generally seen as its champions. Its enablers are the laws of comparative advantage and economies of scale. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>In &#8220;The Great Brain Race&#8221; Ben Wildavsky points to another mighty agent of globalisation: universities. These were some of the world&#8217;s first &#8220;global&#8221; institutions. In the Middle Ages great universities such as Paris and Bologna attracted &#8220;wandering scholars&#8221; from across Europe. In the 19th century Germany&#8217;s research universities attracted scholars from across the world. In the early 20th century philanthropists such as Cecil Rhodes and William Harkness established scholarships to foster deeper links between countries. By the 1960s globe-trotting professors were so commonplace that they had become the butt of jokes. (What is the difference between God and professor so and so? God is everywhere. Professor so and so is everywhere but here.) </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Academic globalisation has gone into overdrive in the modern university. Some of this is along familiar lines&#8212;academics collaborating with ever more foreign colleagues and sabbatical-seekers contriving to spend ever more time abroad. But Mr Wildavsky demonstrates that globalisation is now much more complicated than just cross-border collaboration spiced up with junkets.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Universities are obsessed by the global marketplace for students and professors. They are trying to attract as many students from abroad as possible (not least because foreign students usually pay full fees). Nearly 3m students now spend some time studying in foreign countries, a number that has risen steeply in recent years. Universities are also setting up overseas. New York University has opened a branch in Abu Dhabi. Six American universities have created a higher-education supermarket in Qatar. Almost every university worth its name has formed an alliance with a leading Chinese institution. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>But globalisation is going deeper than just the competition for talent: a growing number of countries are trying to create an elite group of &#8220;global universities&#8221; that are capable of competing with the best American institutions. China and India are focusing resources on a small group. The French and German governments are doing battle with academic egalitarians in an attempt to create European Ivy Leagues. Behind all this is the idea that world-class universities can make a disproportionate contribution to economic growth. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is a fascinating story. But Mr Wildavsky, a former education reporter who now works for both the Kauffman Foundation and the Brookings Institution, is too earnest a writer to make the best of it. He wastes too much ink summarising research papers and quoting &#8220;experts&#8221; uttering banalities. And he fails to point out the humour of sabbatical man jet-setting hither and thither to discuss such staples of modern academic life as poverty and inequality. Mr Wildavsky should spend less time with his fellow think-tankers (who are mesmerised by the idea of a global knowledge economy) and more talking to students, who experience the disadvantages as well as the advantages of the new cult of globalisation at first hand.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n "

    <p><strong>The Battle of Britain: Five Months That Changed History, May-October 1940. </strong>By James Holland. <em>Bantam Press; 677 pages; \xA325.</em> Buy from </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>EVERY country&#8217;s version of the second world war is selective. For Russians, it starts with Hitler&#8217;s unprovoked attack in 1941 and highlights the colossal battles in the east. For Americans, it starts with Pearl Harbour and features the Normandy beaches and Guadalcanal. Germans may privately start the story rather earlier, with the humiliation at Versailles which brought economic collapse and fuelled Hitler&#8217;s rise to power. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Each version is true up to a point. And each seems a bit odd to outsiders. James Holland&#8217;s comprehensive and readable history of the battle of Britain exemplifies the particular British blend of amnesia and nostalgia that the war arouses. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Yet in any terms, this is a tremendous story. In September 1939, Britain was fighting a phoney war alongside a seemingly powerful ally, France. Less than a year later, the country&#8217;s survival depended on whether a fragile array of a few hundred fighter planes, flown by exhausted young men, could prevent Hitler&#8217;s Luftwaffe from gaining the air superiority necessary for &#8220;Operation Sealion&#8221;: the first invasion of England since 1066. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The happy combination of youthful gallantry triumphing against overwhelming odds with brainy boffins giving the vital technological edge (through radar, and the brilliantly designed Spitfires and Hurricanes), as well as inspirational leaders using flawless tactics and matchless rhetoric, is irresistible. The author has an encyclopedic knowledge of his subject, weaving together reminiscences from both sides, statistics and technical details into the broader picture. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>He describes the collapse in France and the near-miraculous rescue in mid-1940 of nearly 340,000 British and French soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk. He also tells the story of the carnage of poorly protected merchant shipping in the early months of the war which threatened to strangle Britain&#8217;s supply lines. He ends with Hitler&#8217;s fateful decision to postpone Sealion in September of the same year. The Luftwaffe had lost too many planes and pilots to the RAF&#8217;s fighters, while Bomber Command had punctured Germany&#8217;s myth of invincibility. It was, as Winston Churchill said, not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Published to mark the 70th anniversary of the battle of Britain, this book should sell well. But it will leave many readers unsatisfied. One problem is its glibness. Hitler can rightly be criticised for his many disastrous mistakes. But to write of the Nazi leader&#8217;s &#8220;almost complete lack of military understanding&#8221; is wrong: his problem was too much (self-taught) military knowledge, not too little. Similarly, to call the German general Gerd von Rundstedt a &#8220;pigheaded fool&#8221; is lazy language that would be out of place in a schoolboy essay, let alone in something that purports to be the work of a professional historian. Throughout the book, the language is unsettlingly colloquial and anachronistic. Confusingly, Mr Holland calls the pilots by their first names, though they refer to each other in diaries and memoirs by their surnames.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>A bigger problem is that the author&#8217;s enthusiasm for his subject is not matched by his grip of history. He peddles the Anglocentric myth that Britain was &#8220;alone&#8221; in the summer of 1940 (insultingly forgetting Greece, Poland and the entire British empire). Too many characters appear, with annoyingly similar potted biographies. Their tinnily-told stories swamp the rather skimpy treatment of the underlying war-winning narrative, such as the innovative tactics of a brilliant New Zealander, Keith Park, and the way that Max Aitken revolutionised aircraft production. Heroism is indeed captivating. But it was more than heroism that kept Britain out of Nazi captivity.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Alexander McCall Smith turns primate power play to music</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | EDINBURGH | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>DIAN FOSSEY did it in the forest with gorillas, William Boyd in fiction with chimpanzees. Now a Scottish composer, Tom Cunningham, has cast baboons in an opera called &#8220;The Okavango Macbeth&#8221; to a libretto by Alexander McCall Smith. It all began after Mr McCall Smith read a book called &#8220;Baboon Metaphysics&#8221; and booked a holiday in Botswana&#8217;s Okavango delta. There he ran into the author, an American primatologist who had been studying baboon behaviour for 12 years. &#8220;Female baboons clearly have some Lady Macbeth issues,&#8221; observes the writer. &#8220;They all have male baboons that they want to become more alpha.&#8221;</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>At its European premiere on May 5th, in the rug-weaving hall at Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, two haunting notes heralded a procession of hornbills, oryx, flying owls, buffalo, impala, elephant, giraffe, warthog and porcupine. The stage was almost bare, the actors&#8217; costumes just detailed enough for the audience to recognise the different species. The animals recall the time when there was peace and harmony, but then came drought and pain, and greed was born. &#8220;It was the baboons who started it&#8221;, sings the chorus.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>As the creator of one of Africa&#8217;s most enduring heroines, Mma Ramotswe of &#8220;No 1 Ladies&#8217; Detective Agency&#8221;, Mr McCall Smith knows a thing or two about strong women. His Lady Macbeth is a powerful female baboon, but she wants more. Macbeth, a young male, is weak and lacks ambition. She urges him to kill the dominant male, Duncan, and replace him as the number one primate. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The zoologists, hidden beneath umbrellas shrouded in brown mosquito netting, move about the stage, symbols at once of colonialism and of Shakespeare&#8217;s Birnam Wood. They watch but do nothing as the leopard moves in and Lady Macbeth gets her come-uppance, deciding in the spirit of &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; that it is just one of those circle-of-life things. The animals sing their rousing final chorus: &#8220;Oh great Kalahari, oh wide Okavango, oh Africa&#8221;.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>This is a marvellous piece of dramatic entertainment. Mr Cunningham&#8217;s music provided ample opportunity for Fiona Scott, as Lady Macbeth, to show off a powerful voice. In insisting that the baboon troupe give full vent to its coughs, whoops and screams, the South African director, Nicholas Ellenbogen, ensured that the opera opened up its dark and unforgettable animal heart.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <h2>Avigdor Arikha, painter of life, died on April 29th, aged 81</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>THE overseer stopped him as he left the foundry in the labour camp, a thin, nervous 13-year-old. He made him take out the book from under his shirt. It contained, inside a jazzy cover, on precious pieces of butcher&#8217;s paper, all the surreptitious drawings he had done of camp life. A patient queue for soup; people begging, with cloth bound round their swollen feet; a woman&#8217;s naked body being thrown into a grave while, on a cart, more stick-like corpses waited. The overseer did not, as young Avigdor feared, destroy his pictures. But he warned him he was &#8220;playing with fire&#8221;. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> A sense of danger and daring infused all Avigdor Arikha&#8217;s works from life. His subjects seemed prosaic enough: fruit, bread, corridors, hanging clothes, umbrellas, portraits of family and friends. But his heavy red apples would be piled in a bowl that teetered at the edge of a table; his loaves still shuddered from being snapped and cut; his corridors showed half-open doors, glimpses of bed-ends or seated backs, shafts of widening light out of which someone had just stepped; his coats had just been taken off, still warm and swinging, hunched on a hanger with a scarf trailing out of a pocket, while his umbrellas, just left, lay half-open on the floor. His portraits, too, caught people on the fly: tired, sulky, uncertain, sweating. Everything was done in a fever of haste, without revisions or revisiting. He painted himself shouting, gaping stupidly, from the back, half-seen in a mirror, as if he was determined to take himself by surprise.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> He was perhaps the best painter from life in the last decades of the 20th century; but he had once dismissed figurative art as <em>pass\xE9</em>. Who, he demanded, could paint an apple after C\xE9zanne? The boundaries of form and colour had been broken. So, emerging from art school in Jerusalem and Paris, he became a modernist for seven years, painting apocalyptic abstracts dominated by black, until he seemed to hit the bottom of a well. He had acquired a glowing reputation in Israel and Europe, but each vaguely geometrical painting was repeating the last. This was mere mannerism. Why not paint the world as it was?</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> His moment of revelation came one day in 1965, in front of Caravaggio&#8217;s &#8220;Raising of Lazarus&#8221; in the Louvre, when he found himself astounded by the drama of sinewy bodies and lit, cascading shrouds. Waking up next morning, he felt &#8220;a violent hunger in the eyes&#8221;. He began to draw his wife, the American poet Anne Atik, over and over again, in a sort of fever. Most of his efforts he threw away. But after that day he worked at drawing things, in black and white only, usually ink on paper, for eight years. The dealers abandoned him, but his compulsion to draw was like a telephone ringing: he had to respond, had to catch the urgent message of the object or the face. By September 1973 he felt he knew enough to do the same in colour. He started to paint Anne&#8217;s brown coat, directly onto the canvas, in the same irritated fever as before. By the end of the day, however, she heard him humming a Bach fugue; all was well.</p>\r\n\
    <h2>The impregnable without</h2>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> He had discovered his own keys to drawing from life: simplicity, modesty, limitation. The last was most important. Only four or five colours (and only the local colours of the object), only the brush, an empty canvas without preliminary sketches and, at most, a day to work in. He had to hold what he saw and felt, here and now, within a grid of potential brushstrokes or possible lines, without employing memory or imagination, for both were cheating. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> His task was, in fact, impossible: to catch what Taoists called the <em>ch&#8217;i</em>, or life-force, of his subject. Making each picture was like throwing a stone without knowing where it would land, how close to the unknowable and unreachable. But he was aware of &#8220;a sort of igniting power&#8221; as he looked at something: a burst of free energy like his own as a teenager when, rescued from the horrors of wartime Ukraine, he had been swept into the strong sunlight of just-emerging Israel, given a new name, Arikha, and sent out on the road to making art. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> He claimed Vel\xE1zquez as his model, for his spontaneity and the luminous simplicity of his forms. But his greatest influence was Samuel Beckett, who was also his greatest friend. From 1956 they walked, talked and drank together all over Paris, rake-thin writer and corkscrew-haired artist, ranging with formidable scholarship over art, literature, music and language. Arikha drew Beckett constantly, with his beaked bird&#8217;s profile, in silverpoint, ink and crayon: playing chess, smoking, listening, pushing back his glasses. </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p> Beckett&#8217;s plays, with their theme of constant striving against the odds, their inevitable failure but determined continuing towards some sort of truth, fitted exactly with Arikha&#8217;s notions of his art. In 1967 Beckett described him at work: </p>\r\n\
    \r\n\

    <p>In <strong>America</strong>, employment outside the agricultural sector increased by 290,000 in April. America&#8217;s workforce grew by 805,000, partly because many unemployed people who had stopped looking for work re-entered the workforce. As a result the unemployment rate rose to 9.9% in April from 9.7% in the previous month.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>The combined GDP of the countries in the euro area was 0.5% higher in the first quarter of this year than in the three months to the end of March 2009. In <strong>Germany</strong>, the euro area&#8217;s largest economy, the economy grew by 1.7% over the same period, while the Greek economy contracted by 2.3%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>China&#8217;s</strong> inflation rate was 2.8% in April, up from 2.4% in March. April&#8217;s inflation rate exceeds that in any of the past 18 months, but is still below the Chinese government&#8217;s target rate of 3%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Industrial production in <strong>Britain</strong> expanded by 2% in the 12 months to the end of March. This rate of growth was the highest since March 2004.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Germany&#8217;s</strong> industrial production was 4% higher in March than in February. During the same month, France&#8217;s industrial output increased by 1%.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p>Industrial output in <strong>Turkey</strong> rose by 21% in the 12 months to the end of March.</p>\r\n\
    \r\n\
    <p><strong>Indonesia&#8217;s</strong> GDP in the first quarter of 2010 increased by 5.7% compared with the same period in 2009.</p>\r\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \r\n \r\n "

    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>The OECD, a think-tank, defines the &#8220;tax wedge&#8221; as the difference between what it costs someone to employ a worker and what that worker takes home as a percentage of total labour costs. A single person with no children who earns the national average wage can expect to take home less than half of what it costs his employer to employ him in Belgium, Hungary (not shown) and Germany. The tax wedge fell in most OECD countries between 2008 and 2009. Many of the declines were primarily because of reductions in income tax. In America, taxpayers stopped receiving cash stimulus payments from the government. This more than offset the result of a decrease in income tax, causing the tax wedge to rise.</p>\r\n\

    <p class=\"info\">May 13th 2010 | From <em>The Economist</em> print edition</p>\r\n\
    <p>The notional amount of outstanding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives stood at $615 trillion in December 2009, up from $605 trillion six months earlier, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). That is still well below June 2008&#8217;s figure of $684 trillion, which was the highest figure since the BIS began to collect such data in 1998. The amount of credit-default swaps outstanding fell by almost 10% in the second half of 2009. Notional amounts are useful as a measure of market size. But the BIS reckons that gross market values provide a more accurate measure of the amounts that are actually at risk. The gross market values fell by 15% in the six months to December 2009, to $21.6 trillion. </p>\r\n\
