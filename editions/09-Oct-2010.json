[{"section":"Leaders","headline":"The quest for growth","title":"The world economy","content":"<p>LOOK at the world economy as a whole, and you could be forgiven for thinking that the recovery is in pretty decent shape. This week the IMF predicted that global GDP should expand by 4.8% this year—slower than in the boom before the financial crisis, but well above the world’s underlying speed limit of around 4%. Growth above trend is exactly what you would expect in a rebound from recession. </p>\n<p>Yet this respectable average hides a series of problems. Most obviously, there is the gap between the vitality of the big emerging economies, some of which have been sprinting along at close to 10%, and the sluggishness of many rich ones. Macroeconomic policy is also weirdly skewed: many emerging economies are loth to let their currencies rise to reflect their vigour, even as fragile rich ones are embarking on austerity programmes. And finally there is a crucial missing ingredient just about everywhere: “micro” structural reform, without which current growth rates are unlikely to last.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a_world_out_of_balance\"></a><br><strong>A world out of balance</strong>\n</p>\n      \n  <p>In the emerging world the macroeconomic errors come from politicians behaving as if growth there were more fragile than it is. The pace has slowed a bit, but from breakneck speed to merely very fast. Most vital signs, from productivity to government debt, are healthy. Yet many policymakers are buying boatloads of dollars to stop their currencies rising as foreign capital pours in from Western investors seeking better returns (see <a href=\"/node/17199508\">article</a>). And emerging economies, as a group, still save more than they invest, which explains why global imbalances—notably the controversial surplus in China and deficit in America—remain so big. That makes little sense. Poor countries, especially young ones, ought in theory to invest more than they save, and so be a net source of demand for richer, older ones, all the more so when the latter are in bad shape.</p>\n<p>In the rich world the danger is the reverse: politicians cutting back on the basis that growth is assured. Big asset busts are usually followed by years of weakness as the over-borrowed repair their balance-sheets. Experience suggests that several years of slow growth lie ahead. Rich countries are planning tax rises and spending cuts worth 1.25% of their collective GDP in 2011, the biggest synchronised fiscal tightening on record. In many places a budgetary squeeze is necessary, but not all; and, taken as a whole, cutting this much this early is a risk.</p>\n<p>Even if demand remains strong enough to cope with this onslaught, the rich world’s longer-term growth prospects are darkening—as our <a href=\"/node/17173886\">special report</a> this week makes clear. Europe’s working-age population is about to start declining; Japan’s is already doing so. Even in America the ageing of the baby-boomers points to a slower-growing workforce. In theory, faster productivity growth could offset this, but in most rich economies that was waning before the crisis hit—and the crash has clobbered productive potential. A feeble recovery could make matters worse, as the unemployed lose their skills, public debt builds up and firms put off investment. </p>\n<p>A gaping growth gap between the emerging and rich worlds will, of course, shift economic heft more quickly towards emerging economies. A fast-growing emerging world is fine, but a stagnating rich one serves nobody—especially if trade tensions start to rise. Western voters may find it intolerable that the likes of China still run big surpluses, thanks in part to those weak currencies. Protectionist rhetoric is already rising in the United States. </p>\n<p><a name=\"all_policies_great_and_small\"></a><br><strong>All policies great and small</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The world would be better served by policies that both improve rich countries’ prospects and reorient growth in emerging economies. These should come in two parts. First, as this newspaper has often argued, macroeconomic policies must be recalibrated. Emerging economies need to allow their currencies to rise more. The rich should tread carefully with fiscal consolidation: sensible budget repairs should be less about short-term deficit-slashing and more about lasting fiscal reforms, from raising pension ages to trimming health-care costs.</p>\n<p>Second, and just as important, is microeconomic reform. No matter what Congress threatens about the yuan, China’s trade surplus will not disappear until it boosts investment in services, removes distortions that depress workers’ share of income and encourages households to save less. From telecoms to insurance, China is full of service oligopolies that need to be broken up.</p>\n<p>Similar growth tonics need to be applied in much of the rich world, both to boost domestic spending in surplus economies, such as Germany and Japan, and to raise productivity. America is more productive than the euro zone and Japan largely because the latter both have a lousy record in services (too many rules and not enough competition). Many labour markets also need an overhaul, especially in southern Europe, where it is still far too difficult to adjust wages or fire permanent workers. One advantage of the crisis for Spain and Greece is that they have been forced to make a start on this. </p>\n<p>The United States also has its own microeconomic to-do list, albeit of a different sort. The most urgent item is the festering mass of underwater mortgages. Almost 25% of homeowners with mortgages owe more than their houses are worth. Faster, more thorough debt restructuring is needed, to make it easier for workers to move to where jobs are more plentiful and to hasten financial recovery. Schemes for unemployment insurance and training also need attention, so that high joblessness does not become entrenched.</p>\n<p> None of these structural reforms is easy. Peer pressure could help. Rather than being fixated on harsher budget-deficit rules, the European Union’s members should pledge to complete the single market in services, to open up cosy national markets to greater competition. The members of the G20 big economies could commit themselves to specific structural goals, from raising retirement ages to deregulating things like transport. A bold microeconomic agenda will not yield instant rewards. Nor is it a substitute for getting the macroeconomics right.

In every other democracy worthy of the name, independent commissions perform the sensitive and vital task of adjusting boundaries to take account of shifts in population. But in no fewer than 44 of America’s 50 states, it is state legislatures, composed as they are of party politicians, who decide where the lines should be drawn for seats in the House of Representatives in Washington, DC. The potential for abuse is so obvious that it is a kind of miracle that the system has survived as long as it has. But on November 2nd a big blow could be struck against the ancient practice of gerrymandering.</p>\n<p> That is when California’s voters will decide whether or not to turn the task over to an independent Citizen Redistricting Commission, laboriously constructed so as to be balanced and independent by a process of screening and random selection. So far only Arizona has anything remotely as good at the congressional level (though some 31 states, including California, have moved in this direction as far as their own state legislative elections are concerned). A further seven states have nominally independent commissions for their congressional seats that are, in practice, partly answerable to the politicians.</p>\n<p> The issue is particularly important just now. America is about to publish the results of its decennial census, so 2011 will be a year of haggling over boundaries to reflect the new numbers, a process known as redistricting. That in turn makes November’s elections to state legislatures much more important than usual. In most states the newly elected legislators will be the ones drawing or approving the new lines. If the Republicans do seize control of Congress at this year’s mid-terms, an important part of the reason will be the ways in which their state-level legislators redrew the lines in big states like Texas, Ohio and Florida after the census of 2000.</p>\n\n      \n  <p> Letting state legislators control the redistricting process is wrong in several ways. Most obviously, it tends to give an unfair advantage, which lasts a whole decade, to whichever party happens to be on top at the crucial time. It also leads to electoral boundaries drawn purely to maximise political gain but making no geographical or administrative sense. Most famously, Governor Gerry of Massachusetts in 1812 devised a district shaped like a salamander; but modern times have produced far worse ones, such as Illinois’s 17th congressional district, known as the rabbit on a skateboard (pictured).</p>\n<p> Worse, politically controlled redistricting helps drive the hyper-partisanship of politics. In turbulent political times, when large swings in the vote are possible, party bosses feel driven to construct safer seats than they once used to need. With fewer seats changing hands on election day, this tends to shift the focus of politics away from the general election itself, and on to the primaries in which the parties select their candidates. The turnout in primaries is tiny, typically only between 10% and 20% of voters, and tends to be disproportionately composed of activists. So those selected tend to be politically slanted to the left or the right extremes.</p>\n<p>California’s sadly dysfunctional government has suffered from this extremism: it is one reason why the moderate Arnold Schwarzenegger has got so little done (see <a href=\"/node/17202435\">article</a>). Angry Californians have already voted to change the system for the state legislature from 2012 and they have a history, when stirred, of setting political fashions (good and bad). Most other states don’t have the power to change voting rules by popular ballot, meaning that legislatures will, in effect, have to vote to disempower themselves. For all these reasons, the more powerful the message California can send on this issue the better. </p>","rubric":"Forget the battle for Congress: the important vote in November could be California’s on gerrymandering","id":"17202149"},{"section":"Leaders","headline":"Biting the hand that feeds him","title":"Public spending","content":"<p>BRITAIN’S new chancellor of the exchequer is normally regarded as a rather divisive character. Yet by announcing that he is planning to cut child benefit to higher-rate taxpayers, George Osborne seems to have united the entire nation in opposition to the coalition government’s plans.</p>\n<p>From 2013 higher-rate taxpayers—currently those with incomes over £44,000 ($70,000)—will no longer receive child benefit (a weekly credit of £20 for the first child; less for second and subsequent children). Even though only 15% of families with children include a higher-rate earner, the right-wing press sees this as an ungrateful attack on the “middle classes” (which in Britain means better-off people, while in America it means the less well-off). They were, after all, disproportionately responsible for voting the government into power. To the left, it undermines the notion of universal benefits which is crucial to retaining widespread support for a generous welfare state. </p>\n<p>For both those reasons, Mr Osborne is right. Spending cuts should hit everybody. The very rich are already paying higher taxes; the poor are going to be hard hit by benefit cuts. The middle classes, however defined, must take their share too, and paying well-off people to look after their children is silly. But the bigger reason to approve of Mr Osborne’s plans is that he has started to chisel away at the idea that the state should not just be a safety net but a universal provider. </p>\n  <p>There are good reasons for the state to provide certain essential services, such as defence, education and health. There are also good reasons for government to help people in difficulties. Beyond that, the state should tend to leave people to make their own decisions with their own money. </p>\n<p>Most governments in decent countries claim to start from that principle. Over the years, however, it gets eroded. Left-wing governments like to increase the size of the state. Right-wing governments like to hand out benefits to their own people. So this leviathan gets bigger and bigger—until, in Britain, it spends around half of GDP. </p>\n<p>It takes a crisis, of the sort that has hit the world economy, to reverse this trend. Mr Osborne has bravely seized the opportunity, but he needs to go much further than just child benefit. The rich get a host of small perks from the state. Older people, regardless of wealth, get a winter-fuel allowance, a free television licence and free bus travel. Those should all go (with the poor helped in more efficient ways). But another, far more contentious issue is coming up for discussion: higher education.</p>\n<p><a name=\"your_money_or_your_gown\"></a><br><strong>Your money or your gown</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Next week Lord Browne, a former head of BP, will produce a report on university funding. He is expected to say that students should pay most of the costs of their education. There will be a horrible row if the government takes his advice—opposition to raising fees, like opposition to cutting child benefit, comes from both the left and the right. It should press ahead.</p>\n<p> At present students pay £3,290 a year for their tuition. That covers less than half of the cost on average (and the best universities, and some courses, cost a lot more than the average). British university students, especially those at the first-tier universities, thus get a fantastic bargain. Students at leading American universities pay seven times as much; they tend to work their way through college to pay for their tuition. And British university students, especially those at Oxbridge, come disproportionately from prosperous families.</p>\n<p>Yet the system is not sustainable. Successive governments have demanded that universities take on more students, while refusing either to fund the academics properly or allow them to raise fees. The quality of education is therefore suffering. Somehow, universities must get more money.</p>\n<p>There are two plausible arguments against raising fees. One is that society, as well as individuals, benefits when young people are better educated. That is true, but according to a recent study by the OECD, in Britain individuals get more than two-thirds of the benefits of higher education: the students are the main winners. The other argument concerns access. The higher fees rise, the harder it will be for poorer students to go to university, for they will have to carry bigger debts into adulthood. That is true; but the alternative is to continue running down higher education or to make poorer citizens pay for the benefits mostly enjoyed by the prosperous.</p>\n<p>These are hard cuts for the government to make.

Tempting? The sales pitch is not for one of the new electric cars from General Motors, Nissan or Renault, but for a 1905 Victoria Phaeton from Studebaker of South Bend, Indiana. </p>\n<p>Electric cars have come and gone over the years. Usually an oil crisis has given them a boost; this time it is a combination of oil prices, fears about energy security and climate change. </p>\n<p>A decade ago the Toyota Prius took hybrid cars into the mainstream. Two years ago Elon Musk’s Tesla all-electric sports car made them sexy. Now the big car firms are pushing all-electric cars for the mass market. At the Paris Motor Show this week they unveiled electric vehicles of all shapes and sizes. Some go on sale in the next few months. </p>\n  <p>This represents a huge leap forward for the industry, but the showroom patter will be misleading, for two reasons. First, although electric cars are nippy, stylish and as easy to drive as conventional vehicles, electric motoring has some distinct disadvantages. Second, they are not really as green as their promoters claim. </p>\n<p>The idea of recharging an electric car at home for only a few dollars and never again having to visit a filling station is enticing. For most journeys, the limitations of battery capacity are irrelevant. As salesmen will be quick to point out, 99% of the time people do only short runs—the daily commute, trips to the shops and to pick up the children—all of which are well within the range of most electric cars. </p>\n<p>But that final 1% of journeys presumably includes the summer holiday when people pile into the car and head off for the coast. Hopping on the train laden with suitcases and children may not be an attractive alternative. And even the relatively short ranges that salesmen advertise may be optimistic. On a cold, wet night when lots of electrical systems are running and the vehicle is laden with passengers and luggage, a car may lose around a third of its supposed range.</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_joy_of_petrol\"></a><br><strong>The joy of petrol</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Carmakers are taking different approaches to these limitations. The Nissan Leaf or Renault Fluence are powered only by a battery. Once they have travelled 160km (100 miles) or so, the battery needs recharging, which can take some eight hours. By contrast, the Chevrolet Volt’s battery has less than half that range, but it carries a petrol generator which gives the car another 480km. Micro cars with just two seats and ranges of only around 50km are also coming: they will charge quickly and work well in crowded cities. But for a combination of cheapness and efficiency, a petrol-powered car is hard to beat. </p>\n<p>And what of electric cars’ environmental credentials? Electric cars are being hugely subsidised by taxpayers—£5,000 ($7,940) in Britain and up to $7,500 in America—on the ground that they are zero-emission vehicles. Makers of electric cars claim that this is an efficient way to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Road transport accounts for a tenth of such emissions worldwide; the sorts of biofuels currently in use are not much greener than petrol; and next-generation biofuels are proving slow to come to the market. </p>\n<p>Although electric cars may not themselves produce greenhouse gases, generating the electricity they use does. How green they are depends on the fuel mix at the power plants in the country in which they are driven. An electric car in Britain today, for instance, produces around 20% less in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than a car with a petrol engine. Even if the generating mix gets greener, electric vehicles are so expensive to produce, that they will still be a relatively costly way of abating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Sceptics therefore doubt that the subsidy is a good use of public money. According to Richard Pike, chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry, replacing all of Britain’s cars with subsidised electric cars would cost the taxpayer £150 billion and, with Britain’s current fuel mix, cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cars by about 2%. For the same money, Britain could replace its entire power-generation stock with solar cells and cut its emissions by a third.</p>\n<p>The only efficient way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions is to impose a carbon tax. If electric cars are a good way of reducing emissions, a carbon tax will enable them to flourish. Taxes, of course, are not as popular as subsidies. But subsidies are almost always a waste of public resources. At this particular time, throwing more taxpayers’ money at the car industry seems a daft thing to do.</p>","rubric":"Electric cars, though a welcome development, are neither as useful nor as green as their proponents claim","id":"17199894"},{"section":"Leaders","headline":"Call Robert Mugabe's bluff","title":"Zimbabwe","content":"<p>ONE of the most disheartening things about Zimbabwe is that its repellent leader, Robert Mugabe, though loathed by many—probably most—people in his own country, is widely admired across Africa, including its most powerful country, South Africa. One reason for this is that he has persuaded many Africans that the main cause of his country’s ruin is the wicked imposition of sanctions by the West, orchestrated by Britain, the evil former colonial power, and the United States.</p>\n<p>This is rubbish. There are no general sanctions stopping trade or financial dealings with Zimbabwe, as there were against its forerunner, Rhodesia, when its white-supremacist leader, Ian Smith, refused to accept black-majority rule. Rather, Mr Mugabe and some 200 people in his ruling set are banned from travel to the United States, the European Union and a handful of other countries, and their assets in those places are frozen. A congressional act also stops America financing Zimbabwean government bodies and companies deemed close to Mr Mugabe’s ruling party through the World Bank and other institutions. But the overwhelming reason why banks are loth to lend to Zimbabwe is that Mr Mugabe’s reckless policies, especially the confiscation of white-owned farms, have entirely destroyed Zimbabwe’s creditworthiness. The personal sanctions have little to do with the country’s economic plight and yet, as our <a href=\"/node/17199688\">briefing</a> this week explains, they hand Mr Mugabe a populist excuse for it.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless the West (and in particular Britain, which still steers Europe’s policy on Zimbabwe) should now change course and offer to lift the sanctions in return for a few critically important pledges by Mr Mugabe. Some 18 months ago a unity government took shape five months after a “global political agreement” had laid out a detailed formula under which Mr Mugabe would remain president but share power with Morgan Tsvangirai as prime minister. As leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Mr Tsvangirai actually won a general election, against all odds, in March 2008. He also won the first round of a presidential contest and would have displaced Mr Mugabe but for a campaign of terror against the MDC that forced its candidate to withdraw. Western governments say they will lift the sanctions only if Mr Mugabe meets the terms of the global political agreement, which he continues brazenly to flout. It is a bargain that will not be struck.</p>\n      \n  <p>But Mr Mugabe’s recent declaration that an election must be held next year offers a fresh chance to break the deadlock. Britain and the West should offer to lift sanctions if Mr Mugabe accepts unrestricted international election monitoring. In the past South Africa and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a 15-country regional club, have laid out fine-sounding electoral guidelines that Mr Mugabe has merrily ignored. This time, if sanctions are to go, it must be agreed that a wider range of monitors, including teams from the Commonwealth, the EU and the UN, are let in—and allowed to stay a month before and after the poll. South Africa and SADC are still crucial. But they—and Mr Mugabe—must be persuaded to let international bodies from outside Africa join the fray. </p>\n<p><a name=\"the_cameron_is_coming\"></a><br><strong>The Cameron is coming</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mr Mugabe has let it be known that he wants to re-engage with the new British government under David Cameron, whose Conservative predecessors he admires for brokering the 1980 Lancaster House accord that first put him in power. It is time to call his bluff. It is clearly a risk, as Mr Mugabe has broken his word so many times. But if he does it again, the sanctions can always be reimposed. Mr Tsvangirai agrees with this approach. And South Africa’s president, Jacob Zuma, is less prone than his misguided predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, to treat Mr Tsvangirai like dirt. Muttering about the old colonial power throwing its weight around may be heard. But Mr Cameron and Mr Zuma must lance this boil together. Once they lock Mr Mugabe into publicly accepting election conditions, the sanctions should be lifted. </p>","rubric":"Lift the sanctions if Zimbabwe’s venally clever leader agrees to have a properly monitored election","id":"17199904"},{"section":"Letters","headline":"On the euro, forests, wind farms, mortgages in America, the Senkaku islands","title":"Letters","content":"<p>\n<a name=\"the_euro\"></a><br><strong>The euro </strong>\n</p>\n<p>SIR – You dismissed the claim that the euro’s long-term survival requires a political union (“<a href=\"/node/17095329\">Euro follies</a>”, September 25th) by claiming that “plenty of previous examples of a shared currency…managed without a shared government”. It is true that a currency union between a minnow (eg, Ireland, Panama or Luxembourg) and a whale (eg, Britain, America or Belgium) can manage without a shared government. But that is because the whale is able completely to ignore the needs of the minnow when setting monetary policy. This is not possible between roughly equal-sized partners, like Germany, France and Italy.</p>\n<p>The Latin Monetary Union (LMU), which you cite, was not a true monetary union in the sense of a shared currency. It was a fixed exchange rate mechanism, based on the franc, which excluded bank notes. Even so, the lack of a central, supranational authority proved its undoing. Without such an authority, the union had to be run by the strongest member country. But, after 1870, France lacked the will and the power to police it.

A key factor in the success of REDD is the application of geospatial technology in the form of geographical information systems (GIS) to collate, map and report forest carbon emission information to investors and international regulatory agencies. </p>\n<p>GIS is the same technology that under-pins the determination of property lines and land tenure, as well as the mapping of land-use patterns in general. Thus investments in REDD, by providing support for implementing GIS for forestry, have a dual benefit. They not only allow those countries to meet the requirements to validate REDD payments but also help them to establish the technical basis for economic development. It isn’t the solution, but it is a start.</p>\n<p>D. James Baker<br>Director<br>Global Carbon Measurement Programme<br>The William J. Clinton Foundation<br>Philadelphia</p>\n<p>* SIR – REDD should work either through offsets created through cap-and-trade or through direct payments funded by global levies on carbon, insurance or foreign-exchange transactions, for example. Offsets, however, are notoriously complex and expensive to develop, and fail to recognise the intrinsic worth of the standing forest.</p>\n<p>One answer is to introduce a simple, global and transparent mechanism that recognises the value of the services that each hectare of forest provides to humanity. If a level of $30 per hectare per annum was set, it would equate to less than ten cents per conserved tonne of CO2 per annum but without counting the multiple benefits of climatic stability, rainfall-generation and maintenance of biodiversity. This compares to $75-$115 per tonne for industrial carbon capture and storage.</p>\n<p>Payments could be determined through satellite monitoring and ground truthing. An essential precondition would be the development of in-country benefit sharing mechanisms. And all stakeholders would need to see benefit—central governments, local authorities, forest communities and individuals. Much of the thinking (and paying) has been successfully developed in the Bolsa Floresta scheme in the Brazilian Amazon. Payments for areas subject to disputed ownership could be held in escrow, providing real incentives to regularise land tenure.</p>\n<p>Hylton Philipson<br>Managing director<br>Canopy Capital Ltd<br>London</p>\n<p>* SIR – Conservation policies, such as bioprospecting, struggle at least partly due to problems of assigning property rights to biodiversity. Attaching rights to carbon in standing forest, while easier to define, will run into similar problems in places where ownership of forestland and forest services are weak and ill-defined. Overcoming such problems may increase the price of REDD credits through higher transactions costs. </p>\n<p>One way around this is not to assign carbon rights to individuals or communities as might occur with indigenous groups in Brazil, and simply have REDD-host governments create, hold and sell these rights. While cheaper, this would be at the cost of excluding forest-dependent peoples from the benefits of new streams of carbon finance (or worse, possibly excluding them from forest areas altogether). Such trade-offs in policy design, while not necessarily inevitable, need to be highlighted for policymakers deciding on REDD architecture.</p>\n<p>Dr Charles Palmer<br>Department of Geography and Environment<br>London School of Economics<br>London</p>\n<p>* SIR – You stated that the funding of REDD is unclear. Since the programme’s success depends on demand for its credits, which may be low in comparison to overall supply, we believe a flexible financing mechanism is required. As such, the best financial approach for REDD would be a mechanism with two tracks: a market track serving as a mitigation option for developed countries, and a fund track serving as a mitigation option for developing countries. The latter allows for the inclusion of Brazil into REDD. In our view compliance issues surrounding measuring, reporting and verifying are more important negotiation issues than financing.</p>\n<p>Jordan Isenberg<br>Dr Catherine Potvin<br>Potvin Laboratory<br>McGill University<br>Montreal</p>\n<p>SIR – In your recent coverage of the REDD programme you neglected to mention the disincentive of donor countries to monitor compliance. Many donor countries support REDD because of the cheap carbon credits that they will receive. When this is the case they will not want to look too carefully at results for fear of losing their credits. Impartial third-party monitoring from an initial baseline level of forests is essential for the real success of the programme, along with a willingness to withhold payments to countries who do not comply. </p>\n<p>Lee J. Alston<br>Krister Andersson<br>Institute of Behavioural Science<br>University of Colorado<br>Boulder, Colorado </p>\n<p>SIR – There are two reasons other than those you mentioned for some guarded optimism in respect to sustainable tropical forestry. First, as the discount rate is at the lowest level it has been in decades, forest assets are much more competitive with other asset classes. Further, mature natural forests provide strong current, and stable cashflow, reducing the duration and volatility of the investment.</p>\n<p>Second, temperate forestry is well known to add positive diversification effects to investment portfolios. The effect in the tropics should be even greater due to the inefficient nature of markets for tropical forests and forest products. As investors see the value of diversification into sustainable tropical forestry on their portfolio then even a small asset allocation into this asset class will have huge positive effects on forest preservation at a time the world needs stable tropical forest holdings most.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey S. Atkin<br>Chief executive<br>Sustainable Forest Systems LP<br>Mill Valley, California </p>\n<p>* SIR – The way to preserve forests is to make timber more commercial. Sweden did this in the early 1900s with forestry acts. It turned a ramshackle industry, in which old-growth forests were largely quarried for their use in making talon, into an industry in which the trees themselves became the marketable product. As a result a whole range of downstream manufacturing grew, for example, the manufacture of chainsaws. </p>\n<p>Countries with tropical-rainforest reserves should follow this pattern. The answer is not to promote boycotts of tropical timber or insist, as the Forest Stewardship Council does, that the same forest management rules apply to planted softwood as rainforests. Equally initiatives such as REDD and other attempts to pay tree growers to absorb carbon usually have a pretty short shelf life as donors tend to move on to focus on other priorities.</p>\n<p>The way forward is better exploitation of forests by the countries that own them. An immediate start could be made now by stopping the trade in unprocessed logs and so initiating the intermediate manufacturing of the raw material locally.</p>\n<p>Cameron Aitken<br>Gartmore, Stirlingshire</p>\n<p><a name=\"blowing_in_the_wind\"></a><br><strong>Blowing in the wind </strong>\n</p>\n<p>SIR – You painted an unnecessarily bleak view of today’s wind industry (“<a href=\"/node/17103845\">Wild is the wind</a>”, September 25th).

That will be three-and-a-half years after his long-ruling Zanu-PF party indisputably lost to the rival Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai (right, above), but then refused to concede. Mr Tsvangirai, as compensation, became a distinctly second-fiddle prime minister. Next time, despite all the tricks Mr Mugabe and his party are sure to play, they could well lose again. There is at least a chance that the president will step down and that, at last, less fettered power will be handed to Mr Tsvangirai.</p>\n<p>Many—perhaps most—perceptive Zimbabweans think such a prospect fanciful. Why, they ask, should the thugs round Mr Mugabe behave any differently next time, especially when their own ill-gotten gains are at stake? And yet, though the economy is still in ruins, politics messy and human rights persistently violated, the picture is definitely less bad than it was two years ago. It is widely considered, with good reason, that Mr Mugabe is running rings round Mr Tsvangirai and is preventing the MDC and its allies from enjoying their rights as a majority in parliament. All the same, a steady momentum is growing for change—and against Mr Mugabe. </p>\n<p>Moreover, though recent reports of the 86-year-old leader’s impending demise were based on his occasional sleepiness at official functions and a stumble or two on ceremonial steps, plainly he could drop dead tomorrow. Behind the scenes, feuding within the ruling party over the succession is getting hotter.</p>\n  <p>Last electoral time round, at the end of March 2008, the playing field was so heavily tilted against the MDC that few thought it could win—yet it did so clearly, albeit by a narrow official margin. Mr Mugabe also decisively lost the first round of the presidential poll, held on the same day, to Mr Tsvangirai. Only after a bizarre five-week silence from a terrified electoral commission did Mr Mugabe, bolstered by his security men and their lethal machinery of repression, declare that Mr Tsvangirai had fallen just short of the required 50%. The shaken president then set about bludgeoning the challenger and his MDC into submission—resulting, after the murder of at least 200 MDC supporters, in Mr Tsvangirai’s withdrawal from the run-off some three bloody months later.</p>\n<p>After that, while the MDC and its allies had a slim majority in the lower house of parliament, Zimbabwe’s slide into ruin continued. Within months of Mr Mugabe’s re-election as president, inflation had reached several billion per cent a year. Eventually, early last year, Zimbabwe’s own currency was abolished altogether, to be replaced by the American dollar. </p>\n<p>Shortly afterwards, a government of national unity (known jokingly as the Gnu) took office. Five months earlier the two main parties, plus a breakaway from the MDC under Arthur Mutambara, had signed a “global political agreement” (GPA), spelling out how power would be shared. Mr Mugabe remained president and Mr Tsvangirai became prime minister, with Mr Mutambara as his deputy.</p>\n<p>Since then, things have undoubtedly improved. The economy’s dollarisation is by far the biggest factor in Zimbabwe’s fragile recovery. As the Zimbabwe dollar gradually became worthless, civil servants, including teachers and doctors, saw their pay shrivel until there was no point in working. Now, though many—perhaps most—Zimbabweans are still on the breadline and 80% have no jobs, at least those in work can predict their income. Inflation is officially running at 5% a year. After years of contraction, the economy is growing—at 8.1% this year, says the finance minister, Tendai Biti, an MDC man.</p>\n<p>Health care and education have improved markedly, from rock-bottom. Hospitals that had run out of the most basic medicines, as well as staff, have begun to function again. More recently more than 13m textbooks, paid for by Western donors, have started to be delivered under the eye of Unicef to all the country’s 5,600-odd primary schools.</p>\n<p>Sales of beer and beverages are sharply up on a year ago. Other indicators, such as sales of roofing material, point to busier economic activity. Traffic in downtown Harare is a lot more clogged than a couple of years ago—and not just because many of the traffic lights are still not working.</p>\n<p>The decline in some types of farming may have bottomed out. Tobacco production, for instance, which peaked at around 230m kg in 2000, just as the mass expropriation of white farms got going, slumped to around 59m kg last year. But this year’s sales suggest that output, thanks in part to a rise in smallholder planting, may have risen to around 120m kg (though that figure may include smuggled imports). Some minerals are also beginning to do better again, notably gold and platinum. And though the ruling party and its military backers plainly hope to filch the diamonds from newly developed fields in the Marange area, Mr Biti is determined to ensure that the Treasury also benefits. </p>\n<p> With recovery, the proportion of Zimbabweans needing food handouts has dropped sharply. Two years ago the UN’s World Food Programme found that at least half the country’s 8m-9m people relied on them. This year probably only 15% of rural folk will do so. </p>\n<p><a name=\"breadbasket_no_more\"></a><br><strong>Breadbasket no more</strong>\n</p>\n<p>But the economy as a whole is still in dire straits. Driving for 140km (87 miles) along the main arterial road eastwards from Harare, you pass mile after mile of derelict and seemingly empty farmland that was once among the most productive in Africa. Not a single pedigree cow is to be seen—nor, for that matter, one white face. Grass along many of the verges has been burnt, apparently because hungry people have been trying to flush out rodents for food. Milk production, though well up on last year’s figure, is seven times smaller than it was. Beef production has fallen nearly fourfold. You see the same desolate picture across the country, once the region’s breadbasket as well as one of the world’s largest producers of top-quality tobacco.</p>\n<p>Of the 4,500 white farmers who owned 6,800 farms, barely 150 still hold their original tracts, according to John Worsley-Worswick, who runs Justice for Agriculture, a lobby that stands up for commercial farmers and their employees. Another 200 or so have stayed on at least a portion of their land, often as managers or leaseholders. (At least 75% of the country’s white farmers, he notes, bought their land on the open market after independence in 1980, having acquired certificates to show that neither the government nor black Zimbabweans wished or were able to buy it.) The invasions are still going on, despite the GPA’s assurance that they would stop, with white farmers still subjected to assault and arson as the police look on. Around 278,000 whites once lived in Zimbabwe; now, at a guess, there are around 12,000. </p>\n\n<p> A large majority of the 350,000 permanent black workers and 270,000 seasonal ones who worked on white farms, with at least 1.5m dependants between them, have lost their livelihoods as a result of the expropriations. Most of them were denied land elsewhere in the communally owned rural areas (formerly known as “tribal trust lands”) because they or their forebears came from poorer neighbouring countries, such as Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. Fewer than 2% of them have benefited from the confiscations. Thousands have been reduced to living in shacks on the edge of towns. Many were among the 700,000 victims of Operation Murambatsvina, when Zanu-PF decided to sweep away entire shanty-towns in 2005.</p>\n<p>The exodus of Zimbabweans abroad, especially to South Africa, has yet to be stemmed, though nearly 420,000 people have been helped to return this year. Figures are disputed, but economic chaos and political repression may have caused a good 3m Zimbabweans to emigrate. The UN’s refugee agency counted 149,000 of them applying for political asylum in South Africa last year alone, quite apart from the much larger number who have slipped over the border for work and melted into the population.</p>\n<p>Despite the country’s surge in economic activity, a drastic decline in manufacturing will be hard to reverse, as cheap Chinese goods flood the local market. Mr Mugabe’s law on “indigenisation and economic empowerment”, enacted in 2007 but due for implementation only this year, has deterred all but the boldest firms, at home and abroad, from investing.</p>\n<p>The aim of the law is to ensure that all businesses worth more than $500,000 should be majority-owned by black Zimbabweans. The definition of “indigenous” rules out native-born whites—and, for that matter, rich black South Africans, though Zanu-PF is always liable to make exceptions for people who pay enough. Mr Mugabe and his allies are candidly racist in espousing the bill, which they promote as complementary to the land-confiscation policy: large-scale property as well as land should belong only to blacks, however liberal individual whites may have been during the struggle for independence. </p>\n<p>The human-rights picture is less horrible than it was two years ago, when Zanu-PF conducted a reign of terror, particularly in the countryside, in response to the MDC’s election victory. And that itself came only a year after thugs presumed to be operating under the aegis of Zanu-PF nearly killed Mr Tsvangirai, breaking his skull, and, in a separate incident in prison, beating him to a pulp, before he was charged with treason, a capital offence. (The mutilated body of Edward Chikomba, the cameraman who conveyed the picture of Mr Tsvangirai’s battered head to the wider world, was found by the roadside outside Harare, the capital, two weeks later.) Thousands of villagers who were thought to have voted for the MDC were displaced, their houses often burned down. Hundreds were killed.</p>\n<p><a name=\"short_sleeves,_long_sleeves\"></a><br><strong>Short sleeves, long sleeves</strong>\n</p>\n<p>But though violence on such a scale has ended for the moment, fear is growing again, partly because Zanu-PF senses that another election may be in the offing. In the past few months a Constitutional Parliamentary Committee, known as COPAC, has been sending “outreach teams” around the country, in theory to discuss a new constitution that is supposed to be drafted in parliament, then endorsed in a referendum. More than a thousand meetings have been held. Many have been peaceful, but Zanu-PF thugs, in an exercise known as Operation Chimumumu (“dumb person”), have been beating up and in a few cases killing suspected MDC supporters who disagree with a so-called Kariba draft favoured by Mr Mugabe. It would, among other things, allow the old man in theory another ten years in office. </p>\n<p>“We don’t have short sleeves, long sleeves any more,” says an opposition leader near Macheke, east of Harare, referring to the way the Zanu-PF thugs treated those suspected of voting for the MDC: “short sleeves” meant that their arms were axed above the elbow, “long sleeves” at the wrist. “But the fear is growing.” “All that our people want is food and peace,” says a worried priest in a rural area north-east of Harare. “But these [Zanu-PF] guys are starting to come back.” A queasy feeling persists that, while the violence is mostly low-key and confined to the countryside, it could erupt in the run-up to another election. Jabulani Sibanda, a leader of the so-called “vets”, most of whom are far too young to have been true veterans of the guerrilla war against Iain Smith in the 1970s, has recently been terrorising villagers suspected of MDC sympathies in parts of central Zimbabwe. </p>\n<p>Although the terror of mid-2008 subsided once it was clear that Mr Mugabe was still pretty much in charge, many leading human-rights campaigners have fled the country: Jestina Mukoko, abducted in late 2008 and held in secret for several months; Noel Kututwa, director of the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, whose band of 8,000-odd brave volunteer monitors prevented Zanu-PF from wholesale ballot-stuffing at the polling stations; Gertrude Hambira of the farm workers’ union; and, most recently, Roy Bennett, the MDC’s white treasurer and deputy agriculture minister-designate, re-elected as an MP in a landslide in an entirely black constituency, whom, for that very reason, Mr Mugabe still refuses to appoint. After Mr Bennett’s eventual acquittal this year on a trumped-up charge of terrorism, for which he spent months in prison, the police say they want to interrogate him on new unspecified charges; he is in hiding abroad.</p>\n<p><a name=\"tsvangirai%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s_travails\"></a><br><strong>Tsvangirai’s travails</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The political picture is patchier still. Plainly, Mr Mugabe has abided only by those parts of the GPA that suit him. A few advances can, however, be chalked up. Commissions on the media, human rights and elections have been set up under decent chairmen. The media has more space, with new licences approved for eight publications, including <em>NewsDay</em>, which offers a far more rounded picture than the Zanu-PF-controlled <em>Herald</em>. The <em>Daily News</em>, by far Zimbabwe’s best newspaper until its presses were blown up in 2001, may revive soon. The very fact that Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe sit down together in cabinet every Monday, apparently without rancour, marks a dramatic turnaround. </p>\n<p>But on a range of issues Mr Mugabe ensures that his prime minister is often kept out of the loop, in blatant defiance of the GPA. He has refused, among many other things, to remove the central-bank governor, Gideon Gono, or the attorney-general, Johannes Tomana, both leading authors of the country’s economic and human-rights disasters. Above all, he has kept his hands tightly on the levers of hard power: the courts, still largely in the hands of Zanu-PF judges, and in particular the army, the police and the feared Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO). By various means, including dirty tricks, deaths and suspensions, the MDC’s wafer-thin majority in the lower house has been whittled away, though it technically still has control if the unreliable Mr Mutambara’s small slice of the party votes with the main bit.</p>\n<p>Owing partly to the MDC’s own lack of guile, the country’s three most repressive laws, the Public Order and Security Act (known as POSA), the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, are still in force. The sole broadcaster is still under Mr Mugabe’s thumb—and full of hate-speak. Even when some of his closest aides and MPs have been arrested or accused on spurious charges, Mr Tsvangirai has been unable to prevent the police or CIO from obeying Zanu-PF’s orders to hamstring his party, disperse meetings and beat up its members.</p>\n<p>Yet he remains incorrigibly hopeful, refusing to criticise Mr Mugabe even for his patent foot-dragging and abuse of the terms of the GPA, which states that the security forces and courts should be politically neutral. “He’s an old man who wants to let go,” he says of the president. “He’s looking for an exit strategy that restores his legacy in Zimbabwe and the world.”</p>\n<p>Mr Tsvangirai has been accused of weakness and dithering by some of his supporters, who want him to express the people’s outrage more forcibly. Even on such core issues as the land confiscations and the indigenisation act, he sounds emollient. “We can’t reverse the land reform,” he says. “But there should be a one-family-one-farm policy” and “we must provide for compensation [for the white farmers] as a matter of principle.” “We have modified the [indigenisation] law,” he says, without demanding its removal. New “sectoral thresholds” must be laid down, so that in some parts of the economy, for instance in mining, maybe only 5% of the company would have to be allocated to black Zimbabweans—“on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis, at proper value”. This is a far cry from Mr Mugabe’s ferocious insistence on 51% of all mid-sized companies and all land going willy-nilly to blacks. But it does not signify flat-out opposition to drastic, race-based redistribution. </p>\n\n<p>Mr Tsvangirai’s apparent aim, rather than demanding in vain that the GPA’s terms be met, is to entrench his MDC in government and prepare the road towards a fresh round of elections by the end of next year. That involves preparing a new voter roll and ensuring that, for a change, the election is properly monitored. In the past, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), an influential 15-country regional club which South Africa unofficially leads, has whitewashed flawed polls in Mr Mugabe’s favour. Now, thinks Mr Tsvangirai, SADC and South Africa, especially its current president, Jacob Zuma, having accepted him as a legitimate prime minister rather than an upstart or a traitor, are likely to give him a fairer wind.</p>\n<p>Mr Tsvangirai also calls for the lifting of the personal sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States and a few other countries against Mr Mugabe and 200 or so of his closest colleagues, who blame these measures entirely for Zimbabwe’s misfortunes. But in return the president must, he says, guarantee that the coming election will be conducted fairly. </p>\n<p>Is this mere wishful thinking? Mr Tsvangirai, noting that against the odds the MDC still managed to win the previous general election, evidently thinks he can pull off the feat more decisively next time. He has also let it be known that he would, if given the chance, form a government of all the talents, including the less venal members of Zanu-PF. He has promised not to impose a policy of retribution. </p>\n<p>He even thinks he can accommodate the “securocrats”, as Zimbabwe’s high-ranking military people and police are known, who have become ever more powerful and rich (from the proceeds of diamonds, among other things) since the sullied election of 2008, and who are now considered Zanu-PF’s most important constituency. Undoubtedly, the security people are jockeying behind the scenes as the succession draws near. These men with guns probably think they can keep Mr Tsvangirai out of power altogether—and for good. But the prime minister is a survivor, and may be cannier than he looks. </p>","rubric":"A fearful stalemate looks unbreakable for the moment. But a sensible solution may yet be found","id":"17199688"},{"section":"United States","headline":"Enter the housekeeper","title":"The California governor's race","content":"<p>ON OCTOBER 2nd Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate, began her second debate against Jerry Brown, her Democratic opponent, by admitting to a Hispanic audience that “I cannot win the governor’s race without the Latino vote.” And yet the ensuing debate—with questions asked in Spanish by Latino moderators—might just have cost her that vote, and thus the entire election.</p>\n<p>If Ms Whitman, a billionaire and former boss of eBay, had had her choice of topics, they would have been the evils of California’s belated budget, red tape and government waste, all of which she, as a tough businesswoman, promises to cut in an effort to create jobs. And she would have reminded voters that several public-sector unions, whose taxpayer-funded largesse towards their pensioners is one of California’s biggest economic problems, are putting their money behind Mr Brown. But the biggest issue, instead, was illegal immigration. And the reason for that was Ms Whitman herself.</p>\n<p>Only days earlier, a sobbing Mexican mother, Nicandra Diaz Santillan, had told a stunned press corps in Los Angeles that she had worked as a housekeeper for Ms Whitman for nine years until June 2009, when she confessed that she was an illegal immigrant. According to Ms Diaz Santillan, Ms Whitman, who was promising to be “tough as nails” on illegal immigrants and their employers to win the Republican nomination, promptly fired her. Wiping away tears, Ms Diaz Santillan said that Ms Whitman was “throwing me away like a piece of garbage”.</p>\n      \n  <p>Ms Whitman’s campaign immediately alleged that Mr Brown’s mob was somehow behind this performance. But the damage to her campaign was done, as polls are beginning to show. Ms Whitman is now open to charges of hypocrisy, after pledging <em>ad nauseam</em> for a year to hold employers of illegal immigrants “accountable”. As Mr Brown said during their debate, this apparently does not include herself.</p>\n\n<p>Thus she began the final month of the campaign on the defensive. This was unexpected. By mid-September, Ms Whitman had already set a record by spending more of her own money for a state office ($119m) than anyone else in American history. Her strategy was to drown out the campaign of Jerry Brown, a former governor and current attorney-general but a pauper by comparison, with constant and ubiquitous attack ads, forcing him either to spend his money early or to leave her attacks unanswered.</p>\n<p>Mr Brown chose the second option, hoarding his money, a bit more than $20m, all summer. Prominent Democratic consultants had advised against this strategy, warning that Ms Whitman would open a permanent lead before the autumn. The surprise was that she did not. Polls taken just before Ms Diaz Santillan’s revelations showed the race, in effect, tied. </p>\n<p>Voters, moreover, remain genuinely split on the central question of the race. Some 43%, according to one poll, consider experience of running a business (ie, Ms Whitman) more useful for the governor’s job, whereas 44% value experience of running government (Mr Brown). </p>\n<p>The good intentions of “outsiders” rarely go far in this complex state. The incumbent governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, also campaigned as a moderate Republican with a promise to “blow up the boxes” in Sacramento, but failed as he ran into the thicket of voter initiatives, interest groups and partisan legislators (see <a href=\"/node/17202435\">article</a>). Mr Brown’s pitch is that after a lifetime of political experience (or two, if you include his father, who also ran the state), the older, wiser “Governor Moonbeam” knows his way through this particular galaxy.</p>\n<p>The main concern about Mr Brown, however, is his cosiness with unions, who have been running their own attack ads against Ms Whitman. Fixing California will require cutting the excessive public pensions that unions have negotiated since 1999. One theory posits, on the Nixon-to-China model, that Mr Brown is the only candidate who can do this. The opposite theory is that Mr Brown will be beholden and thus impotent. Mr Brown likes to cite his age, 72, as evidence that he has no ambitions beyond this last run, hinting that the old maverick would take on the unions. But it is only a hint.</p>\n<p>Both candidates deserve equal blame for not addressing with any specificity California’s most urgent problem. The state faces a deficit of $19.1 billion and still has no budget, three months after the state constitution says it was due. As <em>The Economist</em> went to press, there was talk of a compromise that relies on spending cuts and wildly optimistic accounting. Fixing both the balance and the budget process will be the biggest task of the next governor.</p>\n<p>So it was into a campaign starved of substance that the issue of illegal immigration inserted itself. The problem is smaller than it has been for years, with fewer migrants crossing the border into the state. But as an emotional flashpoint it is potent, especially among the 21% of voters who are Latino. This may also explain why Carly Fiorina, the Republican candidate for US Senate, is trailing the incumbent, Barbara Boxer, despite low approval ratings for Ms Boxer.</p>\n<p>And Latinos now like Ms Whitman less. One questioner in the debate asked why she showed “no compassion” for her former housekeeper. Another query from an impressive, but undocumented, student forced Ms Whitman to say that the questioner should be deported. Heads were shaking in the audience as a terrible debate, and week, for Ms Whitman drew to a close. </p>","rubric":"An illegal immigrant disrupts the race to run the world’s eighth-largest economy","id":"17202319"},{"section":"United States","headline":"Rage against the machine","title":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","content":"<p>NOWADAYS fewer than one in three Californians think their governor is doing a good job. That puts Arnold Schwarzenegger almost in the same territory as Gray Davis, who was recalled in 2003. During debates his fellow Republican, Meg Whitman, has politely stressed how different she would be, while Jerry Brown argues that bringing in well-meaning amateur politicians, even rich and famous ones, does not work. The left moans that the Governator cut spending, the right that he did not cut taxes enough. </p>\n<p>If Mr Schwarzenegger is depressed, he does not show it. Few politicians anywhere exude optimism more physically. Sure, Californian politics is impossible (“There is maze you have to go through, then a minefield, then an obstacle course: you become an athlete”) but from behind his cigar he reels off a set of achievements, from reforming state workers’ compensation to making schools better and building levees. He has managed to keep spending rises below inflation. His main regret is not building more things: he waxes lyrical about visiting South Korea and counting the cranes on the skyline.</p>\n<p>So there is a record to defend. The problem has to do with unmet expectations, probably including his own. Back when Mr Schwarzenegger bulldozed his way to the governorship alongside Mr Davis’s recall, the hope was that this <em>cyborg</em><em> ex machina</em> could change the world’s least governable big economy. It was not just that his celebrity guaranteed him an audience; his brand of hedonistic Republicanism was close to the state’s moderate centre, unlike the partisan, gerrymandered legislature.</p>\n  <p>Since then, as even Mr Schwarzenegger’s friends admit, the system won too often. But was it his fault? California’s governorship is a pretty weak one: the state’s government is a mess of competing districts, counties and cities, with much of the budget mandated by ballot initiatives. The Governator relied on using that referendum system to bypass the legislature. But those centrist voters soon let him down: a series of reforms were easily defeated by the big public-sector unions in 2005. The governor was soon in the sort of slow slugfest his foes excelled at. One Democrat calls him “a Hollywood negotiator”, better at dividing up the spoils than settling down for lengthy line-by-line brawls. </p>\n<p>Against this, Mr Schwarzenegger still managed to win re-election in 2006, and he has doggedly clung to the centre. On prisons, for instance, he has defied right-wingers by repeatedly making the case that California locks up too many people. He has kept going on public-sector pensions and this month won a victory of sorts. There is talk of him setting up an institution to campaign for reform. “He doesn’t give things up,” observes one ally.</p>\n<p>In retrospect, this supremely lucky man was unlucky in his timing—on two scores. First, his successor will have the advantage of several political reforms he did push through—open primaries and an end to gerrymandering in the state legislature—that should make politics in the near future less loopily partisan. Second, the mood has changed. Seven years ago Californians were furious enough to elect him but not to follow through. Now more of them may realise what a mess their state is in. </p>","rubric":"A case of right man, right ideas, wrong time, wrong voters?","id":"17202435"},{"section":"United States","headline":"Still worth reading?","title":"Political polls","content":"<p>THEY are used to determine spending on political campaigns, to guide tactical voting and to enthuse or cow voters. News outlets, bloggers and activists cannot get enough of them. Candidates live and die by them. But even pollsters are worried that many of the political polls in individual races unveiled in the run-up to the mid-term elections in November may be inaccurate. “We’re in a dark age for polling,” says Jay Leve, boss of SurveyUSA, a polling firm. “It’s a very uncertain time.”</p>\n<p>The immediate problem is the rapid growth in the number of people who have only a mobile phone, and are thus excluded from surveys conducted by landline. About a quarter of Americans are now “cellphone-onlys” (CPOs) in the industry jargon, and this poses both practical and statistical difficulties. They are less likely to answer their phones, and less likely to participate in a survey when they do, says Frank Newport of Gallup, another polling firm. They often retain their telephone numbers, including the area code, when they move from state to state, so it is hard to know where they are. And it costs more to call a mobile phone in the first place.</p>\n<p>The extra expense is bad enough for ordinary polling firms, but for those that use automated recordings (also known as “robocalls”) to conduct their polls, it is ruinous. Their overall costs are lower, so the proportional increase is greater. Worse, automated services are prohibited from calling mobile phones by law, so robopolling outfits have to hire real people to reach them. If CPOs make up 10% of a sample, reckons Mr Leve, the cost of conducting an ordinary poll rises by 25%, whereas the cost of a robopoll doubles.</p>\n  <p>The local newspapers and television stations that have underpinned the proliferation of robopolls in recent years (they accounted for almost half of all polls during the elections of 2008) simply cannot afford the extra cost, Mr Leve says. As it is, many of them are slashing their polling budgets or shutting down in-house polling operations. Many are opting to conduct polls by landline only, to save money.</p>\n<p>That is likely to lead to a significant statistical bias. CPOs are younger, less white, and poorer than the average American. They are also more likely to vote Democratic. In a recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press, a landline-only sample showed a 6% preference for Republican candidates; when CPOs were added, the two parties ended up level-pegging.</p>\n<p>At the national level it is easy enough, though expensive, to account for this by surveying CPOs and including them in the sample in proportion to their share of the population. But there are no reliable statistics at the state or local level on the share of CPOs in the population. So when pollsters go to the trouble of calling some of these people, they are left guessing about how to weight their views. Given the number of close contests this year—RealClearPolitics, a website, currently rates five of the 37 Senate races and nine of the 37 governor races as toss-ups, for example—a small bias could lead to lots of mistaken predictions.</p>\n<p>Pollsters can always “rinse” their data to try to correct such flaws. As Mr Newport of Gallup points out, most firms produced reasonably accurate findings ahead of this year’s primaries. It helps that the sort of people who do not have landlines are also the sort who tend to turn out in relatively low numbers in mid-term elections, notes Scott Keeter of the Pew Centre.</p>\n<p>But even if fears of a systematic bias prove unfounded, the fuss about CPOs points to a broader problem for pollsters: the ever-increasing difficulty of persuading Americans to take part in political polls. The proportion of those called who end up taking part in a survey has fallen steadily, from 35% or so in the 1990s to 15% or less now, according to Mr Keeter. Reaching young people is especially difficult. Only old ladies answer the phone, complains Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm.</p>\n<p>Several studies by the Pew Centre in recent years have concluded that dwindling participation rates have not reduced the accuracy of political polling. But at the very least they make polling more expensive, since more calls are required to drum up a decent sample. And there must come a point when participation rates get so low and unrepresentative that no amount of rinsing can clean up the data. In the meantime Mr Leve, for one, advises “extreme caution” when looking at state or local polls this year. </p>","rubric":"It is getting ever harder to work out what the American public thinks","id":"17202427"},{"section":"United States","headline":"A new man for harder times","title":"Pete Rouse","content":"<p>IF THEY ever remade “The West Wing”, the cry would go out to cast Rahm Emanuel in the role which, in real life, he has just given up. Diminutive, pugnacious and profane, he was the chief of staff from central casting. But now that the psychodrama that is Mr Emanuel has moved to Chicago to run for mayor, the White House and those who study it will have to adapt to the subdued, camera-shy personality of Pete Rouse, the man Barack Obama has for the time being put in his place.</p>\n<p>As a once and future politician, Mr Emanuel was used to being in the spotlight and brought his dramatic ways to the West Wing. Mr Rouse’s career has, in contrast, been spent backstage. He is a quiet man and workaholic, who lives alone with his beloved cats. He spent three decades as a Senate aide, including 19 years of service as chief of staff to Tom Daschle, the former Democratic majority leader, whom he saw as a future president. When Mr Daschle failed narrowly to win re-election in South Dakota in 2004, Mr Rouse accepted an offer from the incoming Mr Obama, a freshman senator and rising star from Illinois, to run his office in the Senate. </p>\n<p>According to “The Bridge”, David Remnick’s biography of Mr Obama, his new boss told Mr Rouse: “I want to get established and work with my colleagues and develop a reputation as a good senator, and we’ll see what happens.” Mr Rouse sensed that Mr Obama could have a big future, but expected him to run for president “in 2016 or whatever”. Nonetheless, in January 2006 he had the prescience to send Mr Obama a memo advising him to lay a plan, “below the radar”, to run in 2008 should “a perfect storm of personal and political factors” create an opportunity.</p>\n  <p>Whereupon history and Mr Obama’s career went into fast-forward. Mr Rouse followed the new president to the White House and now, at 64, finds himself chief of staff to a beleaguered president at a time when a fair chunk of Mr Obama’s big future is already behind him and the immediate future looks bleak. </p>\n<p>Although Mr Rouse’s consummate knowledge of Congress will still be useful (his nickname there was “the 101st senator”), the mid-term elections in November could transfer control of the House and even the Senate from the Democrats to the Republicans. That brings the prospect of gridlock and subpoenas. If Mr Obama’s first two years in office were the time for seizing opportunity and pushing through legislation, the next two may require withstanding a siege. Not a bad time, arguably, to bid farewell to the showman and replace him with the strategist. </p>","rubric":"The departure of Rahm Emanuel will change the style of the West Wing","id":"17202445"},{"section":"United States","headline":"The blue blip","title":"Indiana's Senate race","content":"<p>ON A recent Sunday afternoon Brad Ellsworth milled about a policemen’s picnic in Gary, talking football as smoke rose from the barbecue. Mr Ellsworth is a Democrat running for Senate; he has been in Gary a lot. The city and its surrounding county, their steel plants towering near Chicago, are a rare Democratic stronghold in Indiana. In 2008 the county rushed to vote for Barack Obama, helping a Democrat win Indiana for the first time since 1964. Mr Ellsworth hopes for a similar boost. At the picnic Gary’s mayor tried to revive the excitement of two years ago. “We must come out and vote,” he insisted. </p>\n<p>This is not, however, 2008. Moderates who voted for Mr Obama in Indiana are reconsidering their support. The first-time voters of 2008 are discouraged by a lack of progress. “People are disappointed,” explains Shirley Cooper, a police chaplain who brought her family to Gary’s picnic. Mr Ellsworth wants to succeed Evan Bayh, a Democratic senator who announced in February that he would retire. But the Democrats’ winning streak in Indiana may have come to an end. </p>\n<p>Indiana is home to pragmatic conservatives, with a few southern counties dipped in the Bible Belt. Even before Mr Obama’s election, however, Democrats were enjoying a surge in the state. In 2006 Mr Ellsworth was elected to Congress from the “bloody eighth”, a southern district fond of booting out incumbents. Two years later, Mr Obama’s advertisements and superb ground campaign won 1,374,039 votes, 42% more than John Kerry had earned in 2004. All of a sudden, this red state seemed rather purple. </p>\n  <p>The political landscape has changed quickly. Over the past two years Hoosiers have been horrified that their Democratic congressmen tend to vote with Democratic leaders. Three Democratic seats may now fall to Republicans. Mr Bayh, a former governor, was as beloved as a Democrat could be in a conservative state. His announcement in February made his Senate seat unexpectedly vulnerable. </p>\n<p>Dan Coats, the Republican nominee, would not seem the most likely victor. In an anti-Washington year, he is no outsider. The 67-year-old has already served in both the House and the Senate. After leaving politics he was a lobbyist and ambassador to Germany. In 2005, while overseeing Harriet Miers’s disastrous nomination to the Supreme Court, he told CNN that justices had become too intellectual.</p>\n<p>Mr Ellsworth, in contrast, would seem the perfect replacement for Mr Bayh. He is handsome, mild-mannered and hails from a conservative southern county. He can credibly say that he is not of Washington—he has served in Congress for four years but spent most of his career as a county sheriff. He is anti-abortion and pro-gun, with the endorsement of the National Rifle Association. He voted against the House climate bill. In any other state, such credentials might sound like those of a Republican. “Sounds like an Indiana Democrat to me!” Mr Ellsworth says.</p>\n<p> Yet all this may be for naught. Mr Obama’s allure in 2008 is impossible to replicate, so some voters may simply stay at home. Making matters worse, many residents of urban, Democratic strongholds are still unfamiliar with Mr Ellsworth, who got a late start in the race. Many moderates, meanwhile, don’t like his votes for the health-care bill and the stimulus. </p>\n<p>Mr Coats has a sensible demeanour. Voters know his name and that he has conservative credentials. Democrats argue that the voters of 2008 could, if mobilised, change Hoosier politics in this election and those to come. For now, however, Indiana looks set to return to its old ways. </p>","rubric":"Indiana’s Democratic experiment may end in November","id":"17204952"},{"section":"United States","headline":"The new Calvins","title":"Southern Baptists","content":"<p>THE Southern Baptist Convention is the largest Protestant group in America. It claims about 16m members, and long ago spread beyond its geographical origins to every state in the union. But since around 1990 the denomination has been losing ground, relative to America’s population, to other evangelical churches. So a cadre of Young Turks are looking back to the 16th century for fresh inspiration.</p>\n<p> According to Lifeway Research, the SBC’s statistical arm, 10% of all SBC pastors now identify themselves as Calvinists. And that proportion could well rise; a third of recent graduates from SBC seminaries espouse doctrines that hark back to the reformer John Calvin, with the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, a particular source. The SBC evicted its theological liberals back in the 1980s; now, war has been joined between the conservatives.</p>\n<p>Calvinism emphasises that Jesus died only for the elect; Baptists believe Jesus died for everyone. Baptists, by definition, believe that baptism must be an informed choice by the individual, therefore limited to adults; Calvinists believe infants may be baptised. Calvinists think that God selects certain people for damnation; Baptists are more easy-going.</p>\n  <p>“You have a seismic shift in the SBC,” says Wade Burleson, an Oklahoma pastor whose “Grace and Truth to You” blog is a rallying point for the neo-Calvinists. “Change is happening at the SBC and the older established leadership isn’t getting it. It’s becoming far more Reformed theologically than what some are used to. The old guard is dying and retiring and the new guard is young and Reformed.”</p>\n<p>Young Baptists are flocking to conferences that feature Calvinist teachers such as John Piper of Bethlehem Baptist church in Minneapolis, or Mark Driscoll, a flamboyant, controversial pastor who leads Seattle’s largest congregation, the non-denominational Mars Hill church. Up-and- coming pastors, Mr Burleson says, are tired of a constant emphasis on numbers and church size. What converts are drawn to, he says, is theological training and rigorous Bible study.</p>\n<p>The Baptists certainly need perking up. Their annual convention in Orlando this June drew only six reporters from the secular press. Annual baptisms in the SBC rose slightly (by 2.2%) in 2009, but total church membership dropped fractionally, to 16.2m, something once unthinkable in the denomination that produced Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Sunday-school attendance, a more accurate indicator of numbers, is 7.7m, down from 8.2m in 1994.</p>\n<p> Several Calvinists spoke at a pastors’ conference before the Orlando gathering. One was the Southern Seminary’s president, Al Mohler, the denomination’s best-known Calvinist. Another was C.J. Mahaney, pastor of the 3,000-member Covenant Life church in the Washington, DC, suburbs, which bills itself as a “reformed-charismatic” congregation: two words that are anathema to many Southern Baptists.</p>\n<p> Some worried Baptist leaders claim that the neo-Calvinists are rewriting the history of the 165-year-old SBC. “People try to argue that Southern Baptists have always been Calvinist and we’ve departed from the way in the past 80 years,” says Richard Land, president of the SBC’s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. “That is demonstrably false.”</p>\n<p>Mr Land is a contributor to “Whosoever Will: A Biblical and Theological Critique of Five-Point Calvinism”, which is in its fourth printing since its publication in April. He says Calvinist seminary graduates keep their beliefs below the radar when they’re out applying for work, only to uncover them once safe in a job.</p>\n<p>The Baptists have missed out on other trends, such as the 1970s charismatic movement. They now have to decide whether neo-Calvinism is a movement they can safely ignore—or whether it may take over their church. </p>","rubric":"Tensions inside one of America’s most successful churches","id":"17204934"},{"section":"United States","headline":"Help from the moon","title":"Wave power","content":"<p>IN EASTPORT, a little coastal town on the easternmost point of the United States, different means of livelihood have come and gone. Ground-fishing, sardine-processing and a busy deepwater port have all had their day. But residents hope that the sea (with the moon’s help) may still offer something profitable and a bit more predictable. The area has some of the greatest tidal variants in the country, rising and falling by roughly 20 feet (seven metres) on a reliable twice-a-day schedule. When it flows into and out of the region’s many inlets, that current can turn a turbine.</p>\n<p>Tidal-power technology is in its infancy, but a handful of speculative ventures are under way in Eastport. The first to test its prototype is the Ocean Renewable Power Company (OrpC), which in August launched a $2.5m tidal grid-compatible power system, the first in the United States. From the surface it looks like nothing more exciting than a stationary grey barge; but below are two spinning turbines, known as foils, which look like a whirling carbon-fibre double-helix. The project generates just enough power to run the control room and batteries for a coastguard vessel. If it can get a federal commercial permit, the company plans to unveil another $7m installation in 2011, powering 50-75 homes. </p>\n<p>Ingenious it may be, but commercial viability is a long way off.

But there are limitations. Most of America’s tidal-energy capacity is in Alaska, too far from big population centres. Industry analysts reckon that, at maximum capacity, tidal power could generate 13 gigawatts nationwide, small beer compared with the 35 gigawatts of wind generation that already exists. Still, areas like Maine could benefit if the costs go down. A recent study shows that Maine could generate 250 megawatts from the tide, 100 of that in the Eastport area alone.</p>\n  <p>Perhaps the biggest benefit could be to Eastport’s economy. In a county where unemployment reaches 13% in some months, young people are moving away, replaced by seasonal part-timers. “If I wasn’t doing this I wouldn’t have a local job,” says Ryan Beaumont, an ORPC employee who used to work in the sardine industry. The town is striving to make the venture succeed: offering cheap office space and allowing use of its idle port and tugboats. This month Eastport received a $1.4m federal grant to build a manufacturing plant for the ocean-energy industry.</p>\n<p>But some of Eastport’s 1,500 year-round residents are sceptical. Proposals made with similar fanfare have failed in the past. Even tidal power has its history of broken promises. In the 1930s Franklin Roosevelt unveiled a federal project to harness tidal power with dams; it fell through a year later. Maybe this time will be different. </p>","rubric":"A less unsightly rival to offshore wind","id":"17204926"},{"section":"United States","headline":"Rara avis","title":"Birdwatching","content":"<p>THE white-tailed kite cruising over the coastal grassland at Stratford Point is feeling pugnacious.

Of all its conservative rulings, the one they find most enraging as November’s mid-term elections approach is undoubtedly its 5-4 decision in January in the case of Citizens United. This held that since the first amendment tells Congress to make no law abridging the freedom of speech, previous legislation that barred companies, unions and other groups from paying directly for political advertisements during election campaigns was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Barack Obama was furious. This was a “green light” to a stampede of special-interest money that would enable “Big Oil”, Wall Street banks, health-insurance companies and other powerful interests “to drown out the voices of everyday Americans”. As the mid-terms have neared, the cries of “foul” have multiplied. David Axelrod, one of Mr Obama’s advisers, complained in September about “an audacious stealth campaign” by “powerful corporate special interests” using front groups to pour millions into misleading, negative campaign ads that could “tip the scales” in the coming election. The <em>New York Times</em> bemoaned “the most secretive election cycle since the Watergate years”. </p>\n<p><a name=\"vast_right-wing_conspiracy,_revisited\"></a><br><strong>Vast right-wing conspiracy, revisited</strong>\n</p>  <p>How valid are these complaints? This cycle has indeed seen the emergence of an exotic bestiary of organisations bearing innocuous labels such as Crossroads GPS, Americans for Job Security and Americans for Prosperity. These are raising lavish sums for pro-Republican political advertising, but the ads do not disclose the source of their funding. Voters would plainly see such advertising differently if they knew, say, that Crossroads GPS and its partner, American Crossroads, were connected to Karl Rove (George Bush’s former strategy guru), or that Americans for Job Security was formed by the insurance industry, or that Americans for Prosperity is funded by the billionaire Koch brothers in order (says Mr Axelrod) to “support their right-wing agenda and corporate interests”. An investigation by the <em>Washington Post</em> concludes that special interests have increased their spending fivefold compared with the 2006 mid-terms, and that the disclosed proportion has declined from more than 90% to less than half.</p>\n<p>That said, the impact of Citizens United is in danger of being vastly exaggerated. The bipartisan Centre for Public Integrity reports that in recent weeks organisations with Republican affiliations have spent five times more than their Democratic counterparts. Add to this the message from the White House that vengeful, deep-pocketed businesses and shadowy special interests are poised to buy the November elections, and you might well conclude that money is destroying American democracy. </p>\n<p>This is just not true. Consider, for a start, these two words: Meg Whitman. The former chief executive of eBay has by now spent about $120m of her own money on her campaign to become governor of California, and yet the latest polls have her trailing her Democratic rival, Jerry Brown, who says he has spent $11m. </p>\n<p>This is not to say that possession of a personal fortune is a fatal handicap in politics. Michael Bloomberg’s three terms as mayor of New York and Jon Corzine’s victory in the New Jersey governor’s race of 2005 suggest the opposite. But Mr Corzine failed to buy his way to re-election last year. The moral of such stories, and the conclusion of a mountain of research, is that although money can sway the odd race here and there, it is generally subject to the law of diminishing returns. Once a candidate has spent enough to become known, the value of each extra dollar falls. A study by Americans for Campaign Reform in 2008 put that minimum at $700,000 for a crack at a seat in the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>This leads some to argue that instead of seeking to cap campaign contributions and spending, reformers should aim to help candidates across the magic threshold. A bill languishing in Congress, the Fair Elections Now Act, would offer public matching funds. Yet even that may be unnecessary. Gary Jacobson of the University of California in San Diego says the wielders of campaign funds have become expert at spotting competitive candidates and giving them the money they need to make a fight of it. </p>\n<p>Besides, the Democrats are hardly penniless. The Democratic National Committee raised more than $16m in September, mainly from small donors, and has tended to do better at this than the Republican National Committee, whose mismanagement under the lackadaisical Michael Steele is one reason why Republicans are turning to outside organisations. And though outspent so far in the advertising war, trade unions (no less liberated than companies by the Citizens United ruling) have been working hard on the get-out-the-vote “ground war” at which they excel. Mr Jacobson expects the mid-terms to see many races between well-financed Democrats and Republican candidates with less money of their own but more help from outside organisations. </p>\n<p>In other words: a pretty fair fight. Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution says that the Citizens United decision will no more determine the mid-terms than Mr Obama’s outspending of John McCain in 2008 swung the presidential race. That contest was determined by the fundamental politics (rejection of the Bush legacy, the charm of Mr Obama), as November’s will be (the jobless “recovery”, disappointment with Mr Obama). Bill Galston, also at Brookings, goes so far as to wonder whether the fuss about it might be a pre-emptive attempt to explain away a defeat. </p>\n<p>Politics in the United States is contaminated by money in many ways. But if the Democrats are hammered in November, it will not be because of the judicial activism of a conservative Supreme Court. It will be because they have done too few things that voters admire, and too many they do not like. To that extent at least, American democracy remains in rude health. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"For all the money sloshing around in American politics, you still cannot buy the results of elections","id":"17201957"},{"section":"The Americas","headline":"A miss, but not by a mile","title":"Brazil's presidential election","content":"<p>WITH 46.9% of the vote, Dilma Rousseff fell short of the absolute majority she needed to be elected president on October 3rd. So on October 31st she will go head-to-head with José Serra, the runner-up, who got 32.6%. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the hugely popular outgoing president and Ms Rousseff’s mentor, publicly reminded her during the campaign that he had won neither of his own victories in the first round. She did well for a woman who had never before run for office. But her vote was some three to four percentage points less than polls had predicted, and during her unsmiling statement on election night Ms Rousseff was visibly deflated by her failure to win outright. </p>\n<p>It was not Mr Serra but Marina Silva of the Green Party who denied Ms Rousseff a first-round victory. In the opinion polls, Ms Silva had been stuck at around 10% for months. But on the night she got a startling 19.3%. That makes her the most successful third candidate in any of Brazil’s six post-dictatorship presidential contests. </p>\n<p>Abroad, particularly in Europe, a green candidate gaining a fifth of the presidential vote caught many eyes. But although some of those who voted for Ms Silva are indeed environmentalists, others have different reasons for supporting her. Some like her evangelical Protestantism. Her steely serenity appealed to those seeking an alternative to the uncharismatic front-runners. </p>\n      \n  <p>And Ms Silva’s life story matches Lula’s own rise from poverty to power. One of 11 children of Amazonian rubber-tappers, she grew up hungry and learnt to read only in her teens. She put herself through school and university by working as a maid. Although she is now out of the race, she has carved out a new standing as a national political figure. Like Lula’s, her personal appeal transcends party.</p>\n\n<p>The late switch from Ms Rousseff to Ms Silva may have been caused partly by a row about Brazil’s abortion laws. Ms Rousseff tried to finesse earlier pro-choice remarks by saying she was “personally” against abortion, but some Catholic bishops and evangelical pastors advised their flocks to cast their votes elsewhere. </p>\n<p>Other voters were repelled by scandals swirling around Erenice Guerra, a close associate of Ms Rousseff who resigned last month as Lula’s chief of staff. Women in politics are generally regarded as more ethical than men, points out Fátima Jordão, a sociologist at the Patrícia Galvão Institute, a non-profit organisation in São Paulo, and are therefore punished more severely by voters for perceived lapses. </p>\n<p>Both Mr Serra and Ms Rousseff are now courting Ms Silva, hoping to inherit her vote. The Green Party’s president has said he leans towards Mr Serra, but Ms Silva herself was once a member of Ms Rousseff’s Workers’ Party (PT). She is fond of Lula, though not of Ms Rousseff, whom she regards as one of the proponents of industrial development who continually overruled her when she was Lula’s environment minister. Her party is to meet soon to decide whom, if anyone, to support; she may yet remain above the fray. </p>\n<p>An endorsement from Ms Silva might not in fact make much difference. Supporters of a third candidate tend to be quite independent. Those who switched late from Ms Rousseff might find a speedy move to Mr Serra too dizzying to contemplate. Alberto Almeida of the Instituto Análise, a consultancy in São Paulo, notes that in 70% of elections at national and local level that have gone to a run-off, the leader in the first round won in the end. He predicts a victory for Ms Rousseff on October 31st, with a ten-point lead. </p>\n<p>That voters who turned away from Ms Rousseff chose Ms Silva is bad news for Mr Serra’s centrist Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB). He failed to attract either young voters with no memories of the hyperinflation his party conquered in the 1990s, or the poor northern ones in whose hearts Lula reigns. It did badly in Congress, too: a few races are stuck in legal limbo (see <a href=\"/node/17204918\">article</a>), but both the party and its coalition partners lost seats in both houses.</p>\n<p>Unless Mr Serra pulls off an extraordinary coup on October 31st, his party will have to regroup around the states in which it is still strong, and find a new flag-bearer. It retained the governorships of São Paulo and Minas Gerais, which between them give it control of more than 40% of all state tax receipts. The party’s likeliest next presidential candidate is Aécio Neves, a former governor of Minas Gerais who is now a senator. A younger, more charismatic man than Mr Serra, he is not only popular in his home state but also well-known nationally (he is the grandson of Tancredo Neves, who was elected president in 1985).</p>\n<p>If, as still seems probable, Ms Rousseff wins on October 31st, she will lead a coalition that will probably have more than three-fifths of both houses, enough to change the constitution. In neither of Lula’s governments did he command such support in the Senate. That stopped him from doing much that he wanted. </p>\n<p>It has been chastening for Ms Rousseff and her party to have been checked in their triumphal progress towards an inherited presidency. Her opponents worry that Ms Rousseff would continue a trend in Lula’s second term to expand the state, and that she might prove to be a less pragmatic leftist than he was. They will be heartened that she has been denied the kind of blank cheque that a first-round victory might have implied. The next month may even inject livelier policy debate into what has been a dull campaign. </p>\n<p>Lula, who turned Ms Rousseff from a back-room technocrat into an election winner by campaigning at her side, has found his queen-making power has limits.

One was impeached for “mental incapacity”, one fell to a military revolt and one was toppled by street protests. Two years ago Rafael Correa, who served in the illegitimate government that followed the 2005 protests and went on to be elected president in 2006, got through a new constitution that he promised would stabilise the country.</p>\n<p>Yet on September 30th Ecuador was once again plunged into chaos. Police across the country mutinied against a civil-service law that would have streamlined and standardised pay for public employees, reducing the discretionary bonuses of some workers. They abandoned their posts and seized their barracks, leaving much of the country without protection and prompting outbreaks of looting.</p>\n<p>Mr Correa went to the central barracks in Quito, the capital, to talk to the rebellious officers. But he refused to backtrack over the new law. Infuriated by the jeering mutineers, he bared his chest theatrically and dared them to kill him. After then trying to flee, he was attacked with tear gas. One protesting officer reportedly tried to hit his knee, which had been operated on ten days earlier. </p>\n  <p>He was then taken to the adjacent police hospital, where he declared a state of emergency. The foreign minister called on the president’s supporters to march to the hospital and free him. He stayed there until the evening, when loyal forces drove him back to the presidential palace through gunfire from some of the striking officers. According to the health ministry, eight people were killed and 274 were injured.</p>\n<p>It was certainly ugly, illegal and unacceptable, but was the mutiny a coup, as Mr Correa insisted? Some foreign leaders said it was, as did José Miguel Insulza, the secretary-general of the Organisation of American States. It had clearly been planned: air-force troops blocking the runway of Quito’s airport unfurled pre-printed banners. But no coup leaders stepped forward to demand that Mr Correa step down or to proclaim a new government. General Ernesto González, the armed forces chief, had pledged his support for democracy even though he asked that the law be modified.</p>\n<p>Basking in victimhood, Mr Correa has emerged strengthened from the affair, at least temporarily. His approval rating rose by five to ten percentage points in polls taken shortly after the mutiny. Six police commanders have resigned, allowing him to appoint a selection of more loyal officers. He has announced a purge of the ranks of the police. But he has also had to make some concessions to the protesters: the wages of some 7,000 middle-ranking police and army officers are now going to be “corrected” upwards.</p>\n<p>That is a price the government can ill afford to pay. Mr Correa has spent freely after he ordered a default on some of Ecuador’s foreign bonds. He has almost doubled police wages and bought new pistols for the force, for example. But money is starting to run short. The civil-service law was a belated attempt to place limits on the government’s wage bill. Yet some in his own party have opposed plans to raise money to pay pensions by issuing new government bonds. That prompted the president to say that he might use his constitutional power to dissolve Congress, which would allow him to govern by decree until a fresh election is held, although he has withdrawn the threat for now.</p>\n<p>The opposition now fears a witch-hunt. Another worrying aspect of the police rebellion is that, in spite of the resignation of its commanders, the political power of the army may have been reinforced.

Néstor Kirchner, who was president in 2003-07, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, his wife and successor, frequently call for “memory” and “justice” for the victims of the country’s 1976-83 dictatorship. During their terms, hundreds of ex-soldiers accused of atrocities have been arrested.</p>\n<p>No such justice has been extended to the (far fewer) victims of Argentina’s leftist guerrillas. In fact, several erstwhile members of such groups have served in the Kirchners’ cabinets. But the first couple says there is no double standard, because the Supreme Court has approved the reopening solely of cases of crimes against humanity, which can formally be committed only by the state. On September 30th, however, Ms Fernández sabotaged her own claim to support an apolitical reckoning with the past, when her underlings recommended that she give asylum to a former Chilean guerrilla leader.</p>\n<p>In 2004 Chile issued an arrest warrant for Galvarino Apablaza, a founder of a Communist guerrilla group that fought against the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The crimes he is accused of, however, took place after democracy was restored: planning the kidnapping of a newspaper owner’s son and the murder of Jaime Guzmán, a pro-Pinochet senator, in 1991.</p>\n      \n  <p>The Argentine authorities soon caught Mr Apablaza, who was living near Buenos Aires with his wife, Paula Chaín. Chile requested his extradition, and Mr Apablaza applied for asylum. The Supreme Court said it would not rule on his extradition until the asylum issue was settled. On September 1st, one of Mr Apablaza’s former associates accused him of being a ringleader in Mr Guzmán’s murder. In response, the Supreme Court changed its decision, and said the extradition should proceed unless Mr Apablaza was granted asylum.</p>\n<p>This put Ms Fernández in a bind. She is a close ally of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group that protested against the kidnappings of their children during Argentina’s dictatorship but later became an extreme leftist organisation. They say that Mr Apablaza cannot get a fair trial in Chile because a harsh Pinochet-era anti-terrorism law is still in effect (see <a href=\"/node/17209615\">article</a>). Ms Fernández has her own ties to Mr Apablaza: Ms Chaín works in her press office.</p>\n<p>But granting Mr Apablaza asylum poses its own risks. It would strain relations with Chile and hinder Argentina’s own extradition requests—such as for eight Iranians charged with bombing a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires in 1994. Moreover, the Kirchners are already criticised for classifying as “dirty war” victims eight guerrillas who died attacking an army base in 1975, entitling their families to rich payouts. Protecting Mr Apablaza would make their calls for justice look even more like an excuse to settle old scores.</p>\n<p>Ms Fernández said she would follow the advice of the national refugees commission, a nominally independent body whose voting members are all government officials. On September 30th, it duly endorsed Mr Apablaza’s request for asylum. It said that as “a political militant” and “fighter against the dictatorship” he was “not a common citizen”—suggesting that former guerrillas are above the law. </p>\n<p>Chile summoned Argentina’s ambassador and delayed bilateral meetings. Its president, Sebastián Piñera, called the ruling a “setback for justice and human rights”. His coalition includes a party Mr Guzmán founded. Latin America’s many former guerrillas will be glad to know they can take shelter in a country whose “inalienable principles”, in Mr Kirchner’s words, include “the constant fight against impunity”.

The administration of President Asif Zardari, which faces some of the toughest problems of any government anywhere, is consumed by intrigue and incompetence. Foreign donors are looking on with alarm; Pakistan’s army with frustration; and the Taliban—both in Pakistan and Afghanistan—doubtless with glee.</p>\n<p>Pakistan faces two huge immediate problems: how to rebuild much of the country after this summer’s floods, which ravaged 100,000 square kilometres and affected 20m people; and how to deal with the threat of the Pakistani Taliban. In the face of these, the government needs all the help it can get. Instead, it seems intent on falling out with one group after another.</p>\n<p> Relations with America have gone downhill since Pakistan closed the main mountain pass into Afghanistan at Torkham, in response to the killing of two Pakistani paramilitary soldiers in a cross-border incursion by American helicopters. The interior minister has even wondered aloud whether America is an ally or an enemy (see <a href=\"/node/17209687\">article</a>).</p>\n      \n  <p> Pakistan’s army is profoundly dissatisfied with the government’s performance, particularly on the economic front. The armed forces, say insiders, have given the government a list of the most useless and light-fingered officials, whom they want dismissed. The American administration is said to support this demand. </p>\n<p>But Mr Zardari is reluctant. He does not want to be seen to be acting under compulsion. He is resisting sacking some of his most trusted lieutenants, though he may have to. He is more concerned with fighting his own legal battles. Next week the courts are due to resume a hearing about a legal amnesty that wiped away old graft charges against him and other officials.</p>\n<p> International donors, who have so far given $640m in response to a United Nations appeal, plus $866m outside it, are frustrated by the government’s inability to put forward any sort of post-flood reconstruction plan. All the money is for emergency relief and “early recovery”. There is no plan or money for long-term rebuilding. Nor has the government taken the chance to push through economic reforms that, as the floods have made clear, are urgently needed. It has so far failed, for instance, to introduce any revenue-raising measures to increase woefully low levels of tax collection (tax accounts for just 9% of GDP), though it says it will bring in a sales tax.</p>\n<p>Supporters of Mr Zardari hoped he would use the floods as an opportunity to improve the government. Instead he is in confrontational mood, believing, apparently, that he will benefit whether he survives or is thrown out, since in the latter event he would win kudos as a political martyr and improve the chances of his Pakistan People’s Party whenever the next vote is held. “It’s a slow-motion unravelling of this regime,” says Mushahid Hussain, the secretary-general of an opposition party. “The government has been unable to rise to the occasion. The floods are a game-changer.”</p>\n<p> Certainly not every problem is of the government’s making. After years of conflict between the judiciary and Mr Zardari’s party, the courts seem determined to unseat the president. Opposition parties are talking about joining up to pass a vote of no confidence in the administration, which is a long way short of a majority in parliament. The international relief effort has been doing less to help the flood victims than it might have done. A bewildering array of UN agencies, Western governments and NGOs are duplicating efforts and eating up big chunks of aid money in administrative costs. </p>\n<p> Whoever is at fault, the result is that many flood victims have been left to fend for themselves, struggling to remake their homes or rebuild their ruined farms with the few resources they can muster. The government is currently distributing $230 to each household, but that is woefully inadequate. Wheat farmers whose crop was washed away need seed and fertiliser now if next year’s crop is not to be lost, too.</p>\n<p> The responses of both the federal and provincial governments have been feeble. Nobody trusts either to use donations honestly or to implement projects efficiently. In the most populous and richest province, Punjab, the provincial government has raised about $12m in flood relief—only $2 for each person affected. In desperation the provincial government, which is run by the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) of Nawaz Sharif, the main opposition leader, has tried to outsource its reconstruction efforts altogether.</p>\n<p>Recognising the absence of trust in any level of government, Mr Sharif (whose brother is chief minister of Punjab) has asked the private sector to take up reconstruction work, urging businesses and charities to adopt damaged villages and to undertake projects such as rebuilding houses and schools. The government would merely offer advice. An initial list of over 200 villages has been drawn up. The scheme shows that at least the Punjab government is thinking creatively. But given that 500,000 homes and 1.7m acres of farmland were damaged in Punjab alone, it is hard to see how a task on this scale can be outsourced—and doubtful that the private sector has the appetite to take it on.</p>\n<p>Mr Zardari insisted this week that the “victory” of his reconciliatory approach to politics was that “no one wants an undemocratic act” now. Certainly it is hard to see Pakistan’s army stepping in, even to install a new civilian government of technocrats, a favourite theory in Islamabad.

Responding to growing public outrage over cross-border drone attacks by the American-led forces in Afghanistan and to revelations in a recent book by Bob Woodward that 3,000 CIA operatives are active in its tribal regions, Pakistan closed the main supply route for NATO convoys. The interior minister, Rehman Malik, said: “We will have to see whether we are allies or enemies.”</p>\n<p>Since then things have got worse. Unable to get through the main Torkham crossing in the Khyber Pass, NATO convoys that bring up to 80% of the supplies needed by international forces in Afghanistan from Karachi in the south have been sitting ducks. Since the border closure there have been half a dozen attacks by Taliban militants on the convoys, one involving 14 gunmen in three pickup trucks who opened fire on a large group of fuel tankers near Quetta, torching at least ten and killing one of the drivers. Reflecting the government’s apparent indifference to (or even acquiescence in) the attacks, the local police chief said it was up to NATO to provide security for its convoys. </p>\n<p>The border may soon be reopened, when a joint inquiry by NATO and Pakistan into the helicopter attack agrees on an acceptable form of words. Pakistan wants an apology and promises of no recurrence; on October 6th America’s ambassador in Islamabad duly grovelled, but the commander of NATO forces, General David Petraeus, could only promise to try harder not to repeat the mistake. The underlying problem of insurgents using North Waziristan as a haven from which to launch attacks and assist jihadist terrorists remains.</p>\n  <p> The past week has seen many reports, mostly emanating from Islamabad, of a well-advanced al-Qaeda plot to launch commando attacks in Berlin, Paris and London similar to those that took place in Mumbai in 2008. The rumours have been played down by European intelligence agencies, which describe the threat as “non-specific”. But there were a record 26 Predator drone attacks last month, a spike in activity that suggests something is going on. One attack, on September 8th, appears to have killed Abdul Jabbar, a British citizen who, according to intelligence sources in Pakistan, was being trained to lead a hit squad in Europe. Pakistan’s ambassador to America also revealed that another strike, on October 4th, killed eight militants, including four Germans.</p>\n<p>Given the reluctance of the Pakistani authorities to take on the terrorist groups in North Waziristan, particularly the brutal Haqqani network that is believed to have links with Pakistan’s ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence agency), and given growing public fury over encroachments on the country’s sovereignty, the tension is unlikely to go away. Even the one potentially hopeful development this week—reports of American-backed secret talks between the Afghan Quetta Shura Taliban and the government of Hamid Karzai—could cause new strain if Pakistan reacts badly to being left out. A breakdown in relations between America and Pakistan is a real and dangerous possibility. </p>","rubric":"Closing the border to NATO trucks is a sign of a fracturing relationship","id":"17209687"},{"section":"Asia","headline":"The Petraeus strategy up close","title":"American troops in Afghanistan","content":"<p>LAME, toothless and 80 years old, Haji Beardad is not exactly imposing. Yet the American soldiers in the northern Arghandab valley in Kandahar province court him assiduously, promising a school and a mosque for his village of Kuhak. For Haji Beardad, frail as he looks, is an important ally. Since he told the Americans that his people would co-operate with Afghan security forces and keep watch for outsiders, attacks in Kuhak have dropped sharply. “I’ve told everybody in the village to report if someone comes to visit or we’ll have him arrested,” he says. </p>\n<p>Nagahan, a village west of Kuhak, even has a local militia to keep the Taliban out, in exchange for American promises of development—and sometimes plain cash. “We’re paying them off,” says Captain David Ahern of Alpha company, 1st battalion, 66th armoured regiment. Violence in Nagahan has also dropped sharply.</p>\n<p>The Arghandab valley, a staging-post for insurgents attacking the city of Kandahar to the south, is a test of the West’s newish strategy in Afghanistan. The province gave birth to the Taliban, who ran the valley until recently. The surge of American troops reached the valley earlier this year. Now, after a summer of the heaviest fighting since 2001, it is swarming with American and Afghan troops, with a chain of outposts and checkpoints along the valley. Insurgent activity is on the wane, though commanders concede that this may reflect the usual winding down of the Afghan fighting season in September. </p>\n  <p>As the villages of Kuhak and Nagahan show, regular patrolling by American and Afghan forces, coupled with an understanding with elders who are ready to stand up to the Taliban, can yield results. But these leaders are hard to find. In many places the locals are not keen. Even if they do not support the insurgents, as many appear not to, they may be too afraid to co-operate with the allies. Some have been beaten or executed by the Taliban. “In the village of Pir Paymal, we thought we were making headway. Then they received some threats and now they’re scared again,” shrugs Staff Sergeant Anthony Tomasello of Bravo company, only a few miles south-east of Kuhak. </p>\n<p>In some areas no locals are left because the Taliban have scared them away. What typically remains is a cluster of abandoned houses and a minefield of booby traps and bombs, scattered on roads and in the fields among empty villages. This terrain is a soldier’s nightmare: orchards and fields parcelled into the tiniest plots by irrigation canals in which the only way to get around is on foot, chasing the ghosts of an enemy who almost never shows himself. Because of the threat of mines, it can take four hours to cross a kilometre. </p>\n<p>Despite their success with the occasional village elder, the Americans have been taking a pounding. Bravo company has suffered a staggering 28 casualties in two months, though luckily nobody has been killed. By the end of September things were so bad that the 1st battalion had to launch another operation to sweep clean an area it had supposedly held for months. “We haven’t made much of a dent,” admits Sergeant Tomasello. </p>\n<p>The coming winter calm may give them some breathing space. “I only need one or two villages like Kuhak in every company sector for people to see the benefits of peace and development, and to want to have it too,” says Lieutenant-Colonel Rodger Lemons, the commander responsible for most of the valley. But there is no way to tell whether this will happen until next summer, when fighting begins anew.</p>\n<p>Until then, the Americans are left struggling to rebuild the valley’s destroyed tribal structure by getting local elders to work with the state administration and the fledgling security forces. This is an undertaking of breathtaking audacity, as the allies admit. To be sure, there are signs that local government is coming back to life, though there are too few civil servants who are sufficiently qualified and brave. Meanwhile, the Americans must plug the holes themselves.</p>","rubric":"Slow and bloody nation-building in Kandahar province","id":"17209697"},{"section":"Asia","headline":"Mount Everest is singing for joy","title":"Railways in Tibet","content":"<p><a href=\"#footnote1\">Correction to this article</a></p>\n\n<p>“MOUNT EVEREST is singing for joy and the Brahmaputra River swirling with happiness”. Or so says an official Chinese newspaper (using the Tibetan names, Qomolangma and the Yarlung Tsangpo). After much delay, China has started to extend its controversial railway line in Tibet that will draw more tourists to the mountain and boost trade with South Asia. How happy the outcome will be is not so clear.</p>\n<p>Planning for the 253km (157-mile) line from the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, to the region’s second city, Shigatse, began in 2002, four years before Lhasa itself was connected to China’s railway network. The authorities appear not have been deterred by the problems that the railway brought to Lhasa. A tourism boom and a flood of immigrants from China’s interior contributed to an explosion of unrest among embittered Tibetans in March 2008. The launch ceremony in Lhasa of the $2 billion extension on September 26th was celebrated by dancing children in elaborate Tibetan costumes. Chinese television said the line would be of “great significance for the strengthening of ethnic unity”. </p>\n  <p>Like the route to Lhasa, which crossed the highest terrain of any railway in the world, the single-track extension will involve considerable technical difficulties. Nearly half of it will go through tunnels or over bridges (96 of them). It will cross areas prone to earthquakes, landslides and sand storms. Whereas the line to Lhasa had to traverse unstable permafrost, the new one will be challenged by geothermal fields with hot springs. All this at an oxygen-starved altitude of 3,550-4,000 metres. </p>\n<p>The railway will make it easier to reach Mount Everest, which can expect to see a lot more tourists eager to be photographed in front of the world’s highest peak (Shigatse is also due to open an airport soon, Tibet’s fifth for civilian use). In 2007 the Chinese side of the mountain recorded 27,476 visits by Chinese tourists, almost twice as many as in 2006, after the new rail service to Lhasa had opened. Environmentalists are worried. </p>\n\n<p>So are the Indians. The government in Delhi has been nervously watching China’s build-up of infrastructure in Tibet. The extension to Shigatse, besides facilitating military movements near China’s border with India, is likely to boost trade with Nepal, where the two giants are vying for influence in a power struggle that is still going on. China has long-term plans for more extensions of the line, to Nyalam on the border with Nepal and to Dromo near Bhutan and the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal wants the railway extended to Kathmandu, which India fears would give China more clout in a country India sees as part of its sphere of influence. Another proposed line, from Lhasa east to Nyingchi, would bring the network close to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, most of which China claims. </p>\n<p>Tibetans might have mixed feelings too. The rail link to Lhasa brought disproportionate benefits to ethnic Han Chinese whose language and culture enabled them to take quicker advantage of the Han tourist influx. <em>Tibet Business News</em> said the majority of traders in Shigatse were migrants from beyond Tibet. It quoted a woman from neighbouring Sichuan Province saying that the railway would cut her costs of doing business in Shigatse by half.

Spectacular though the show undoubtedly was, not everybody was starry-eyed. Spectators booed Suresh Kalmadi, head of the organising committee, as he made his welcoming speech. Cracks later appeared in the running tracks. And Australian officials complained that their athletes had been “treated like cattle” as they were forced to endure an hour-long wait in a stifling tunnel before the ceremony.</p>\n<p>After a shambolic prelude to the games, the opening extravaganza, a mostly well-organised display of Indian showmanship, was unsurprisingly hailed as a turnaround. Days before, Delhi seemed to be heading towards humiliation. Some venues were unfinished, a footbridge collapsed and rooms for athletes were found to be filthily uninhabitable. Many of the problems were blamed on corruption, with Mr Kalmadi himself among the accused. By the time the games kicked off, the city looked in better shape, though bird droppings were found in the swimming pool and the scales used to weigh boxers had added a couple of kilograms—enough, apparently, to disqualify competitors. </p>\n<p>More worrying, the 60,000-strong crowd that gathered for the glitzy opening ceremony seemed to melt back into the city, perhaps never to return. Many early events were said to have featured more participants than observers. This was perhaps partly because so many star athletes had pulled out, citing security concerns. With 100,000 security personnel deployed in the city centre, and lengthy security checks at each event, their worries may have been overstated.</p>\n  <p>There were memorable high points in the early days, including a rousing reception for athletes from India’s arch-rival, Pakistan, as they marched into the stadium. There were also nice comic touches, including Mr Kalmadi’s description of the heir to the British throne (who opened the games) as “Prince Diana”. </p>\n<p>But however smoothly the games proceed in the coming days, they have already cost India dear, from the $3 billion that the government says it has spent to the estimated 100,000 slum-dwellers who have lost their homes to bulldozers. In a letter also on the front page of the <em>Times of India</em> before the opening ceremony, Azim Premji, head of Wipro, one of India’s largest software firms, put the true cost of the games at $6 billion (way over budget) and asked pointedly: “Is this drain on public funds for the greater common good?” In the first week of events, India may have avoided humiliation but it has not provided a convincing answer to that question.</p>","rubric":"But has India got its priorities right?","id":"17204647"},{"section":"Asia","headline":"Of cabbages and Kims","title":"South Korea's kimchi crisis","content":"<p>IN SEOUL, the South Korean government is staring nervously across the border, wondering about the succession under way in North Korea. The city is also preparing for a G20 summit in November. But the word on everyone’s lips is cabbage. The price of this humble vegetable, which forms the basis of <em>kimchi</em>, the Korean national dish, is soaring. Everyone from the president to the commonest crook and blogger is getting in on the act.</p>\n<p>It is hard to exaggerate the importance to Korean life of <em>kimchi, </em>which is usually made of fermented cabbage. Its presence at every meal, as well as its health benefits, give it an almost religious status. It is a national symbol, and the one food item that (in an entirely unscientific poll undertaken by <em>The Economist</em>) a majority of Koreans “cannot live without”. </p>\n\n<p>It is unfortunate, then, that one head of cabbage can now cost over 11,000 won ($10), more than pork and up from 2,000-3,000 won a year ago (see chart). <em>Kimchi </em>is now being dubbed <em>keum-chi</em>, the first syllable being Korean for gold. </p>\n  <p>Such is the clamour for the stuff that when the municipal authority of one rural town announced that it would sell cheap packets of cabbage in brine, its website was inundated with inquiries and crashed. Last week a group of men was arrested for trying to steal 400 cabbages in rural Gangwon province.</p>\n<p>A poor harvest brought on by bad weather was the original culprit, but with prices soaring, hoarding may also be responsible. Year-on-year inflation jumped from 2.6% to 3.6% between August and September, pushed up by cabbage’s new status as the Ferrari of vegetables. Annual cabbage-price inflation is now 400% in Seoul, say official statistics.</p>\n<p>Normally, Koreans serve home-grown <em>kimchi</em> as a matter of honour. But people are now looking abroad for their fix, sparking a debate about the suitability or otherwise of different countries’ cabbages. Many Koreans think Chinese-grown agricultural produce is unsafe, but they are having to swallow their pride about that. President Lee Myung-bak says he will be getting his personal stash from Western producers, earning him comparisons to Marie-Antoinette from South Korea’s numerous and critical bloggers. His administration has announced the temporary lifting of tariffs on imported cabbages, in advance of the traditional <em>kimjang</em> season, in which <em>kimchi </em>is prepared for the winter.</p>\n<p> The country has not yet seen rioting in the streets, as happened in Mexico’s tortilla crisis of 2007. Nor are trenchcoat-clad men whispering down dark alleys, “psst, want some cabbage?” However, Korea’s <em>kimchi </em>crisis is a worry, not just for cabbage-munchers but policymakers.

Its first summit in Bangkok in 1996 was attended by 25 countries. Its eighth in Brussels this week attracted no fewer than 46, as well as representatives of the European Union and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Size, however, is not everything. Many who took part in the Brussels summit lamented its failure to achieve ASEM’s founding goal— a “new comprehensive Asia-Europe Partnership”. The consensus was also that this is Europe’s fault. Both ideas are questionable.</p>\n<p>The charge-sheet of alleged European crimes is a familiar one, albeit rewritten with fresh evidence. There is the arrogance of the EU’s lecturing Asia over human rights. There is Europe’s failure to grasp that it is in terminal decline and must cede to a thrusting Asia some of the space that European countries occupy in the global institutions set up after the second world war. A test-case discussed in Brussels was European over-representation on the board of the IMF. The offer to share two of Europe’s eight seats hardly seemed to grasp this nettle.</p>\n<p>Third is Europe’s inability to speak with one voice, and the ability of national interest groups to hijack policy. At an EU summit in September, the Europeans agreed to help Pakistan after its recent devastating floods by offering preferential tariffs for its textile exports. But this had to be watered down after objections from France, Italy, Poland and Portugal. </p>\n  <p>The reforms set in train by the EU’s Lisbon treaty to bring greater coherence to European foreign policy seem to many Asian eyes to have made things worse. They have also given rise to a related complaint, that the EU is too preoccupied with its own internal workings to notice that it is losing friends and failing to influence people. Kishore Mahbubani, a Singaporean former diplomat who is now dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, put this trenchantly in an article in <em>Time</em> in March: “Europe just doesn’t get it. It does not get how irrelevant it is becoming to the rest of the world.” He blamed “Europe’s obsession with restructuring its internal arrangements”.</p>\n<p>It seems odd, then, that one gesture the EU has made towards getting more involved in Asian affairs has been rebuffed. This is its aspiration to join yet another regional talking-shop, the East Asia Summit. This groups the ten members of ASEAN with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. Russia and America are to join next year. The group has the potential to become one of the more important of the plethora of forums filling the calendars of Asia-Pacific leaders. </p>\n<p>EU membership was at first held up for technical reasons, because one condition was to sign the “Treaty of Amity and Co-operation” with ASEAN, something open only to countries, not organisations. That obstacle has been removed. But still ASEAN refused to allow any mention in the closing ASEM chairman’s statement even of the EU’s aspiration to join. The feeling, apparently, is that the EU has not done enough to deserve the honour.</p>\n<p>For the EU’s critics, its own summit in September was a good example of its failings. Called “to give new momentum to the union’s external relations”, it was instead overshadowed by a row with France over the expulsion of Roma immigrants. So it combined evidence of both hypocrisy over human rights with the EU’s habitual navel-gazing. This belies the summit’s conclusions, which aspired to make the EU “an effective global actor, ready to share in the responsibility for global security and to take the lead in the definition of joint responses to common challenges”. </p>\n<p>“All daydreams, at least for now,” says Shada Islam of the European Policy Centre, a Brussels think-tank. She agrees with ASEAN that the EU is not ready yet for a seat at the grand-strategy table. But this may not be a fair benchmark by which to measure the state of EU-Asian relations. Trade, its bedrock, is thriving. Between the EU and Asian ASEM members it increased by over 25% in the first half of 2010 compared with the same months in 2009. And China, at least, seems to have decided that Europe and its currency are worth saving, making investments in Spain and in Greece. Stopping in Athens on his way to the ASEM summit, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, promised more support. Yet this may in part be a tactical manoeuvre to deflect criticism from Europe and America over the level of China’s currency and, in general, to be nicer to Europe at a time when relations with America and Japan have been rocky. </p>\n<p>China’s friend-in-need sympathy to the EU’s stricken economies seems in sharp contrast to the harangues to which some of its officials and academics were subjecting the EU just a year ago. But in fact both approaches reflect a desire to see a reasonably cohesive EU as well as a viable euro. Asian expressions of frustration with the EU often seem to betray an impatience with the pace of European integration that ignores the difficulty of the process. It is also the sort of interference in other countries’ internal affairs they rail against when directed towards Asia. </p>\n<p><a name=\"a_meeting_too_many\"></a><br><strong>A meeting too many?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this context, ASEM, which is often portrayed as a rather desperate measure by Europeans to cling to their vestigial Asian interests, seems more like an Asian drive to engage Europe. It does at least provide a venue for meetings. Naoto Kan, Japan’s prime minister, for example, attended in the apparent—and realised—hope of bumping into Mr Wen and beginning to patch up relations. There are plenty of other forums in the coming weeks where they could also have met. ASEM has yet to prove its necessity. But to suggest that relations between Europe and Asia are doing all right and do not need an elaborate, artificial multilateral process is heresy.

As a convenience to visitors annoyed by having to lug wads of cash, Iran’s savvier carpet dealers and hoteliers have evaded the blockade by collecting credit-card charges overseas, in places such as Dubai, and then wiring the funds to their local accounts. </p>\n<p>That neat trick has now grown trickier. Complying with recently tightened international sanctions, financial regulators in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which includes Dubai, have frozen dozens of Iranian bank accounts and clamped strict controls on currency transfers to the Islamic Republic. The sudden squeeze on foreign-currency supplies, which also hit Dubai’s large and lucrative merchandise re-export trade with Iran, sent Iran’s rial, which had held steady against the American dollar for years, into an abrupt 15% plunge late last month. Jittery citizens mobbed Tehran’s currency dealers, desperate to buy dollars before another fall.</p>\n<p>Iran’s central bank soon intervened, injecting enough dollars to steady the market. Yet the brief panic revealed that, for all the bluster of their leaders, ordinary Iranians are increasingly worried and indeed hurt by sanctions. These now take many forms, from an outright ban on the import of Persian carpets to America that took effect last month to the targeting of individual officials for alleged human-rights abuses, the stopping of Iranian operations by big multinational firms and a growing reluctance by shipping and insurance companies to service Iran-bound cargoes. </p>\n  <p>Even taken together, the sanctions are unlikely to bring the world’s fifth-biggest crude-oil exporter to its knees. The loopholes remain big enough, and the attraction of Iran’s 75m-strong market strong enough, to keep goods and money flowing. Although South Korea joined Japan last month in slapping sanctions on a range of Iranian banks and firms, bringing it into line with other American allies, it remains keen to protect trade with Iran that topped $10 billion last year, so it quickly signed a deal to let Korean and Iranian traders settle accounts via special facilities in two Korean banks and in Korean currency. The Asian powerhouse, China, sees no need for such sleight of hand, and has rapidly expanded its share of Iran’s market, as has neighbouring Turkey.</p>\n<p>Yet the sanctions, stiffened in June by a fourth round of UN Security Council measures intended to punish Iran for its nuclear ambitions, are inexorably adding to the cost and hassle of doing business. Almost all the biggest international traders in refined petroleum products, for instance, have stopped dealing with Iran, forcing the country to rely on costlier small-scale overland shipments for much of the petrol that it still has to import because of underinvestment in refining. </p>\n<p>The sanctions have also stemmed the flow of much-needed foreign investment and skills, particularly to the energy sector that accounts for 80% of Iran’s export earnings. In recent months five large European oil companies that have long kept toeholds in Iran, in the hope of one day taking advantage of its vast unexploited potential, especially in natural gas, have promised to pull out for good. Inpex, Japan’s biggest oil-exploration firm, says it is likely to suspend operations in Iran. In June South Korea’s GS Engineering and Construction cancelled a $1.2 billion gas-processing project. Largely as a result of such setbacks, Iran’s oil ministry is unlikely to hit its targets of raising oil-production capacity by 35% by 2015 and launching exports of liquefied natural gas, concludes a recent report by Nomura, a Japanese stockbroker. Instead, oil output is likely to fall by 15% and exports by as much as 25%. </p>\n<p>None of this has dented the exuberance of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s president, who recently repeated his prediction that capitalism is doomed. Instead he has trumpeted minor achievements, such as a free-trade deal with neighbouring Armenia and an agreement to resume direct flights between Iran and Egypt after a 30-year hiatus, as signs of diplomatic success. Iran’s foreign-currency reserves, he insists without revealing figures, can keep the rial steady for years to come</p>\n<p>Perhaps the president is right to believe that foreign challenges are not Iran’s biggest worry. After crushing its reformist opponents, his conservative faction has broken out in increasingly rancorous internal wrangling. The biggest looming issue is Mr Ahmadinejad’s plan to slash consumer subsidies that cost his government $70 billion-100 billion a year, a quarter of GDP. Already lumbered with feeble economic growth and high unemployment, Iranians now face the prospect of sharp rises in prices of food, fuel and transport.

In the World Economic Forum’s “gender gap index” it comes an impressive sixth out of 134 countries in the world. In the UNDP’s “gender empowerment measure” it also does well, being placed 26th out of 182 countries. But in the UN’s “gender-related development index” it is ranked a poor 129th, again out of 182. Such a wide discrepancy is not simply because the various bodies measure different things, but also because the picture of women in South Africa is so mixed.</p>\n<p>In the “founding provisions” of South Africa’s 1996 constitution, “non-sexism” is given equal billing with “non-racialism”. To promote women’s rights in what had been a predominantly patriarchal society among whites as well as blacks, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has brought in a slew of laws over the past 16 years, legalising abortion, giving women equal power in marriage, cracking down on domestic violence, criminalising sexual harassment at work, banning all gender discrimination and providing women of any skin colour with the same degree of affirmative action in education, employment and politics as blacks, coloureds (people of mixed race) and Indians. Another gender-equality bill is due soon.</p>\n<p>On paper South Africa has one of the world’s most impressive legal arsenals for protecting women’s rights. But the gap between principle and practice is often wide. In some areas, particularly in politics, it does well. Women played a big part in the liberation struggle and the ANC has promoted their cause. Women hold 44% of parliamentary seats, the third-highest proportion in the world, and 41% of cabinet posts, including many of those often assigned to men: defence, agriculture, foreign affairs, mining, science and technology, and home affairs. Gill Marcus is the first female governor of the central bank. The Democratic Alliance, the country’s main opposition party, is headed by Helen Zille. </p>\n      \n  <p>In other areas, however, women’s progress has been slower. More than a decade after the passage of the Employment Equity Act, which requires companies with over 50 people to hire and promote women (as well as blacks and the disabled) in proportion to their representation in the population as a whole (52%), white men still dominate senior management and company boards in both the public and private sectors. The Women’s Business Association says that a fifth of the country’s private-sector boards have no women (and that only 10% of chief executives and board chairmen are women). Universities, where more than half of undergraduates are now female, have done more, with women now accounting for 45% of academic staff. About a quarter of judges are female.</p>\n<p>Although women make up nearly half the labour force, most are in lower-wage sectors, particularly domestic service. So women on average still get less than two-thirds of a man’s pay packet. Women are also more likely to be unemployed and to head the poorest households. The introduction of a child-support grant for children up to the age of 15, recently raised to 18, has helped, but it amounts to only 250 rand ($36) a child each month. </p>\n<p>It is in the home, particularly in black ones, that attitudes have changed least. There men continue to rule the roost, sometimes imposing their authority with drug- or alcohol-fuelled brutality. In its latest world report, Human Rights Watch, a New York-based lobby, describes the level of physical and sexual violence against South African women as “shockingly high”. South Africa has one of the highest incidences of reported rape in the world. In a study by the World Health Organisation, fully 40% of South African women claimed that their first experience of sex was non-consensual. South Africa also has one of the world’s highest murder rates.</p>\n<p>The (black) founder of a new women’s-rights lobby, the Sonke Gender Justice Network, says his biggest challenge is to convince men that abusing women is culturally unacceptable. But women are sometimes complicit, too. Violence is often seen as a normal part of male-female relations. According to recent research by the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, a Johannesburg-based group, most black women believe a man has a right to have sex with his wife or partner whenever he wants. Another study showed that most black teenagers felt it is fine to force sex on a girl if you know her or if she accepts a drink from you.</p>\n<p>Traditional customs die hard. President Jacob Zuma has at least 21 children by at least ten different women, four of whom he married; he is now engaged to another, who is pregnant. In certain rural areas women are still expected to walk a few paces behind their husbands. In KwaZulu-Natal thousands of bare-breasted maidens display their virginal beauty in a dance before the polygamous Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini. In villages in the eastern Cape teenage girls continue to be forced into marriages with older men who treat them as virtual slaves. Women who do not fit into the community are still sometimes burned as witches. Lesbians are gang-raped to “cure” them of their follies.</p>\n<p> The lot of ordinary South African women is still hard. But it is getting distinctly better.

A well-known rebel group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), which is most active in the oil-producing south, claimed responsibility but blamed the government for the deaths, insisting that it had ignored back-channel warnings given 24 hours before the blasts. </p>\n<p>The attacks took place close to President Goodluck Jonathan, as he was reviewing a parade a few hundred yards away in front of invited dignitaries. Shortly before the bombings he had declared: “There is certainly much to celebrate: our freedom, our strength, our unity and our resilience.”</p>\n<p>Such qualities will be sorely needed in the next few months. The president is standing for re-election in a poll due on January 22nd, having acquired the top job only because his predecessor, Umaru Yar’Adua, died in May, three years into his four-year term of office. Mr Jonathan had been a fairly lacklustre deputy. Some, especially in the north, whose people generally reckon on one of their own having an eight-year stay as president, dispute his right to stand and have promised him a tough fight.</p>\n  <p>Campaigning may now focus on proposals for new anti-terror laws. The election may even be postponed. Officials have said they need extra time to compile accurate voter lists. Since the end of military rule in 1999, Nigeria has held several elections. All of them have been marred by violence and claims of fraud.</p>\n<p>The president says he is determined to have a clean and peaceful poll. In the immediate aftermath of the recent attack, he chose a new national security adviser, completing a reshuffle of security posts that began a month ago with the appointment of new heads of the police, the armed forces and the intelligence service.</p>\n<p>Few Nigerians are sure about whom they should blame for the bombings. MEND is a fissile organisation. Some 100 former fighters, including MEND’s former leader, met the president on October 5th and said they had nothing to do with the attack. The group had never hit the capital before. Yet the government seemed keen to blame it. Presumably as a result of a request by the Nigerian government, Henry Okah, a former MEND leader now living in South Africa, was arrested in Johannesburg. His lawyers denied that he was involved in the attacks.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in a move that further muddied the waters, security forces in Nigeria detained and questioned Raymond Dokpesi, a media baron who recently became the chief of staff to Ibrahim Babangida, a northern former general who ruled Nigeria from 1985 to 1993 and now intends to stand against Mr Jonathan in the coming election. Security sources say that Mr Dokpesi, who owns a television network and a shipping line, was implicated by text messages found on the mobile phone of another suspect but was later released. His arrest particularly upset Mr Jonathan’s northern opponents.</p>\n<p>The attack in Abuja is unlikely to be the last act of political violence in Nigeria before the poll. The country’s police say they foiled a similar attack in September. Security at airports has been stepped up. The episode has made everyone involved in Nigeria’s steamy politics twitchy. </p>","rubric":"A lethal bombing gives Nigeria the jitters in the run-up to a momentous poll","id":"17209786"},{"section":"Middle East &amp; Africa","headline":"A rum old mix","title":"An index of African governance","content":"<p>ONCE again Africa’s worthiest and perhaps happiest countries, according to Mo Ibrahim’s latest measure of all-round governance, scrutinising data gathered for last year, are offshore. Mauritius is the runaway winner, followed by the Seychelles in second place and Cape Verde fourth (see table). On the African mainland, Botswana, with the advantages of ethnic homogeneity, a small population, diamonds and good leaders, does best, in third place, with South Africa, by far the weightiest country in Africa, fifth. At the other end of the scale, the most wretched land is Somalia, with Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe competing for Africa’s wooden spoon.</p>\n<p>There are no big changes in the pecking order. The yardsticks applied by Mr Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born British telecoms magnate and philanthropist, judge countries on a mix of four main criteria: “safety and the rule of law” (looking at the murder rate and corruption, among other things); “participation and human rights” (that little matter of being able peacefully to chuck out a bad government); “sustainable economic opportunity” (including such things as fiscal management, free markets and inflation); and “human development” (in essence, education and health care).</p>\n<p>Some countries do surprisingly well despite their lack of democracy. Tunisia, which is run by a dictator but gives its people a decent life in other respects, comes eighth; Libya, which has one of the nastiest human-rights records in Africa but gives its people loads of welfare, is a respectable 23rd. Others, despite wealth and civil vibrancy, do notably badly. Nigeria is down in 40th place and Angola, though it oozes oil, comes a dismal 43rd. Two countries favoured by many development buffs, Rwanda and Ethiopia, do badly because of their deteriorating human-rights records: Rwanda is in 31st place and Ethiopia in 34th. </p>\n  <p>In regional and religious terms, it may be noted that Muslim and Maghreb countries do badly on the democracy and human-rights index. Green-minded advocates also think Mr Ibrahim should think of applying a new criterion for managing natural resources and tackling climate change. Urban planning and innovation could also usefully be measured. Particularly pleasing, for Mr Ibrahim and for Africa’s well-wishers at large, is that governments across the continent are taking the table seriously.

Four years later he was in disgrace with his own camp for securing a mere 13% of the vote as leader of the party list in elections to the European Parliament. But Nicolas Sarkozy is nothing if not a fighter. He punched his way back into the government in 2002 and secured the presidency in 2007. Now, despite crushingly low poll ratings, he is once again trying to plot his comeback.</p>\n<p>The starting point could hardly be more testing. This month Mr Sarkozy’s popularity rating fell to 26%, according to TNS Sofres, a pollster, a nadir it has touched only once before, in July. At least 1m people have taken to the streets during one-day strikes this autumn against the government’s raising of the minimum retirement age. An open-ended strike has been called for October 12th. Abroad, Mr Sarkozy’s image has been dented by the highly publicised evacuation of illegal Romani camps in France—although most French voters seem to approve. At home, a breezy opposition Socialist Party has started to believe that the next presidential election, in 2012, is there for the taking.</p>\n<p>Mr Sarkozy seems to be devising a two-pronged fightback. First, he hopes to use France’s presidency of the G20, which starts in mid-November and is followed by the G8 presidency in 2011, as a means to reassert his voice abroad and to boost his standing at home. When France held the rotating European Union presidency in the second half of 2008, Mr Sarkozy’s popularity rating climbed from 38% to 46%, according to OpinionWay, another pollster.</p>\n  <p>Never short on ambition, Mr Sarkozy wants the G20 to become the forum for talks about global economic stability and governance, including exchange-rate volatility. “Monetary imbalances threaten all our economies,” he declared in Brussels this week. There are plans for the two G20 summits in France next year to be preceded by thematic seminars steered by various world leaders, the better to squeeze meaningful decisions out of the summit meetings themselves. To this end the French have been quietly talking to the Chinese, trying to get the idea of exchange-rate co-ordination on the table.</p>\n<p>A foretaste of Mr Sarkozy’s new diplomacy will be on display on October 18th and 19th, when he meets Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russia’s president, Dmitry Medvedev, in the Normandy resort of Deauville. He will revive an idea he first raised in 2008, in response to Russian proposals, for a new “economic and security space” between Russia and the EU. Many EU countries considered this to be a Russian ploy to weaken NATO, and American officials are watching nervously. Mr Sarkozy, who returned France to NATO’s integrated military command last year, argues that Russia needs to be treated as a partner rather than a threat, especially if the West wants its help over such matters as Iran’s nuclear programme. </p>\n<p>Mr Sarkozy’s second front is a plan to refresh his government and give domestic policy a boost. Before the summer he said he would reshuffle his government by late October, after parliament had passed pension reform (the legislation is currently before the upper house). Since then Paris has been awash with rumours. Certain ministers seem likely to go. They include Eric Woerth, the labour minister caught up in an alleged political-favours affair linked to Liliane Bettencourt, the billionaire heiress to the L’Oréal cosmetics company. Bernard Kouchner, the foreign minister, who comes from the political left, has said that he almost quit over the Romani expulsions, and could now step down. Some heavyweights, such as Alain Juppé, a former prime minister, may return to high office.</p>\n<p>But the biggest question-mark hangs over François Fillon, the prime minister. He is the second longest-lasting occupant of the job since Raymond Barre, who served under Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1976-81. French presidents in trouble traditionally boot out their prime minister. Yet Mr Fillon, whose calm, professorial style contrasts with Mr Sarkozy’s hyperactivity, is unusually popular. And there is no obvious replacement. Christine Lagarde, the finance minister, is well liked and internationally respected, but lacks political clout. Michèle Alliot-Marie, the justice minister, is too linked to the Chirac era. Mr Sarkozy could reach for a younger face, such as Bruno Le Maire (agriculture minister) or François Baroin (budget minister). Or he could defy tradition and keep Mr Fillon on. The uncertainty makes for distracting parlour games, but not for stable policymaking.</p>\n<p>Is a new government likely to do anything useful in the 18 months left before the 2012 presidential election? Aides to Mr Sarkozy had been arguing that there was no time for any more reforms after the retirement-age increase. But now the tune seems to be changing. Senior officials insist that the president will “continue to reform the country until his last minute in office”. </p>\n<p>One idea is to rethink the tax system. This week Mr Fillon raised the prospect of the abolition of France’s wealth tax, imposed yearly on almost all assets worth over €790,000 ($1.1m), and the tax shield that limits all personal taxation to 50% of income. Mr Sarkozy had supported the shield, partly to help lure tax exiles back home. But it has led to rebates worth millions for some of France’s richest people, including Mrs Bettencourt, who got a cheque from the state for €30m this year. In a country where nearly 8m people live on less than €949 a month, the shield has become a symbol of fiscal injustice to many. Some way of combining the abolition of both the shield and the wealth tax with a higher upper tax band could be seen as fairer, by rich and poor alike.</p>\n\n<p>Yet such plans await Mr Sarkozy’s reshuffle decision. There is no guarantee that a new government, or a fresh round of globetrotting, will be enough to lift his miserable poll numbers. Unease over the style and clannishness of his mercurial presidency will remain. A diplomatic flurry may exasperate foreign friends, and lead to little. The experience of Mr Sarkozy’s two immediate predecessors, both of whom were re-elected, offers little comfort (see chart). At this stage in his first term, François Mitterrand was unpopular, but less so than Mr Sarkozy—whereas Mr Chirac had already regained the poll numbers he enjoyed in the months after his election.</p>","rubric":"France’s unloved president plots his comeback","id":"17204962"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"Not exactly Dutch courage","title":"Politics in the Netherlands","content":"<p>MEET the Netherlands. A small, affluent, densely populated northern European country, economically timid, with the potential for ethnic strife simmering just under its quiet surface. That is the picture painted by the agreement underlying the new Dutch centre-right minority government, consisting of the liberal VVD and the Christian Democrats. With the backbench support of the far-right Freedom Party and its leader, Geert Wilders (see <a href=\"/node/17200240\">Charlemagne</a>), the new government will have a majority of just one in the 150-seat parliament.</p>\n<p>Mr Wilders has extracted a range of policy goodies in return for his support. The new government will ban the face-covering Islamic veil, and forbid police and workers in judicial institutions from wearing the headscarf. Immigration via marriage will be curbed. State subsidies for newcomers’ language courses will be turned into loans, and a failure to pass the subsequent tests could become grounds for a refusal to grant residence permits. </p>\n<p>The agreement is long on heavy-handed police tactics as a response to crime-ridden ethnically mixed neighbourhoods, but has nothing to say about poor infrastructure, school drop-out rates, skills shortages and low social mobility among both immigrants and natives in such areas. </p>\n      \n  <p>More surprisingly, the government has shunned any serious attempts at structural economic reform. Mark Rutte, leader of the VVD and prime minister-in-waiting, campaigned on a pledge to revitalise the Dutch economy. But no substantial effort will be made to reform either the labour market or the inflated government-subsidised housing market. The generous pension system will remain, and the pension age will creep up by just a year, from 65 to 66, and then not until 2020. “This must be the most conservative and anti-reform economic programme we have had in the past 40 years,” says Sweder van Wijnbergen, professor of economics at the University of Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>And despite the professed radical liberalism of both the VVD and Mr Wilders, there is a whiff of social conservatism to their vision for the country. Nobody questions issues such as euthanasia, abortion or gay marriage, considered to be private matters, but this liberal spirit will not extend to the public space—the famous coffee shops of Amsterdam will become members-only clubs closed to foreigners. The ranks of the police will grow by 3,000, a policy which will please Mr Wilders.</p>\n<p>Under the new dispensation the Netherlands, traditionally a fairly outward-looking place, will adopt a more critical attitude towards the European Union. The government is likely to oppose Turkey’s EU membership bid, and will look sceptically on any further expansion of the club. Spending on foreign aid will be cut.</p>\n<p>Some observers expect that the new coalition, the first minority government in modern Dutch history, will fall apart at the first hint of trouble. But the parties may hold each other in a firmer grip than some expect. They are well attuned to the concerns of Dutch voters, many of whom, outside the big cities that are frequented by tourists, are a socially conservative bunch, anxious about the economic and social changes globalisation can bring. Instead of helping them to face up to today’s challenges, the government has chosen to play upon their fears. </p>","rubric":"The new government unveils its uninspiring vision for the country","id":"17204823"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"How now Brian Cowen?","title":"Ireland's politics","content":"<p>IT IS “a critical moment”, says Garret FitzGerald, a former Irish prime minister. As the Irish people brace themselves for even more fiscal austerity, the challenge for the political class, Mr FitzGerald suggests, is to put country before party so as to ensure that Ireland avoids Greece’s fate—a loss of economic sovereignty and a euro-zone bail-out. </p>\n<p>To do this Brian Cowen, the prime minister, must take some more tough decisions, and soon. His Fianna Fail-led coalition has pledged to outline its fiscal plans for the next four years ahead of the December 7th budget. Olli Rehn, the EU’s economics commissioner, has said that they must include sector-specific adjustment measures. By January, when the government is due to resume borrowing, Mr Cowen needs to have done enough to convince bond investors that there is a credible plan in place to bring the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2014. </p>\n<p>Investors’ nervousness about Ireland’s ability to meet that target has greatly increased in recent months, as the cost of bailing out the country’s banks, especially Allied Irish and Anglo Irish, has soared close to a massive €50 billion ($69 billion). With no growth likely this year, the budget deficit has been revised up to 11.9% of GDP, excluding the bank bail-out costs. If these are added in, the figure rises to an eye-watering 32%. The government’s borrowing costs have risen sharply, with the yield on ten-year Irish bonds now more than four percentage points higher than their German equivalents. Not surprisingly the rating agencies are nervous: this week one downgraded Ireland and another gave warning it could do so.</p>\n\n  <p>Mr Cowen has withstood some minor backbench revolts against his leadership, but he is struggling to retain public confidence. Some were outraged by his “hoarseness” during a recent radio interview that followed a night of socialising with party colleagues. In parliament, where the government’s majority has been steadily eroding thanks to defections and dissent, the coalition depends on the support of increasingly fretful independents. Luckily for Mr Cowen, Fine Gael, the main opposition party, has failed to capitalise on the government’s difficulties. In June its leader, Enda Kenny, survived a leadership challenge—and he is once again under pressure. This makes a snap election less likely. </p>\n<p>Yet after three years of austerity in which household wealth has fallen by almost a third, most of the public remain deeply pessimistic. In one opinion poll, 70% of respondents said they felt that the worst was yet to come for the economy. Most also believed that a change of government would have no economic impact. The patriotic rallying call of Mr FitzGerald has never seemed more necessary. </p>","rubric":"Ireland’s prime minister struggles to reassure investors and voters","id":"17204859"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"Guts and glory","title":"Latvia's election","content":"<p>LATVIA’S recent history has seen off several axioms of modern political economy. One is that maintaining a fixed exchange rate in the midst of a slump is suicidal. Latvia kept its currency peg to the euro and has regained competitiveness through an “internal devaluation”, with large cuts in wages and public spending: a fiscal adjustment equivalent to some 14% of GDP. </p>\n<p>Another axiom is that voters punish governments that impose tough austerity programmes. But the coalition headed by Valdis Dombrovskis, the prime minister, won the parliamentary election on October 2nd with 58.6% of the vote, despite presiding over a record 18% drop in GDP in 2009. Mr Dombrovskis’s Unity party almost doubled its seats in parliament, to 33 (out of 100). </p>\n<p>Voters have also disproved another proposition: that money inevitably distorts the political process, particularly in poor countries. The main oligarch-backed party, For a Good Latvia, collapsed to just eight seats (from 33 before), despite showering money on the campaign and buying the country’s best-known independent newspaper. Voters appear to have blamed it, with justice, for reckless policies in the boom years.</p>\n  <p>Foreigners who bailed out Latvia with a €7.5 billion ($10.9 billion) loan in late 2008 are relieved. The economy is returning to growth, with sharp rises in exports and industrial production (though unemployment remains high). But Mr Dombrovskis is facing a new problem. The runner-up in the election was Harmony Centre, a centre-left party backed by most of the country’s ethnic Russians, and also by ethnic Latvians fed up with the established parties. It has won 29 seats in the new parliament. </p>\n<p>With this showing Harmony Centre could try to tempt away Mr Dombrovskis’s main coalition partner, the Greens and Farmers Union, which won 22 seats. To avert that, Mr Dombrovskis could offer Harmony Centre a deal, perhaps in place of the smallest coalition party, a new ultra-nationalist alliance which has eight seats and an unpleasant fringe.</p>\n<p>Harmony Centre is already in power in the capital, Riga. But bringing a “pro-Russian” party into the national government, even in a minor role, would be a big political risk, and Mr Dombrovskis may prefer to stick to his existing partners. The new government must be formed by November 2nd—and start work on next year’s budget. That will mean yet more spending cuts and tax rises to meet the deficit target of 6% of GDP set by international lenders. Meeting the conditions to adopt the euro in 2014, the government’s aim, will be more demanding still. </p>","rubric":"Latvians defy conventional wisdom by re-electing an austerity government","id":"17204851"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"Greenery in high places","title":"Germany's Greens","content":"<p>LEADING lights of Germany’s Green party can sound like Zen masters. “Only one who changes can stay true to himself,” intones Renate Künast, co-chairman of the Greens in the Bundestag. Ludger Volmer, once party chairman, speaks of the “art of inconsistency”. Koan-like utterances come naturally to a party that grew out of youthful protests in the 1970s, became an “anti-party party” in 1980 and then wielded power as part of a centre-left government from 1998 to 2005. Now in opposition, the Greens are riding higher in polls than ever. In elections next year they could take charge of one or even two state governments for the first time. </p>\n<p>That would be a big shift. Post-war German politics has been ruled by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which usually form majorities by recruiting smaller partners (the CDU now governs with the liberal Free Democratic Party, or FDP). But the big parties’ share of the vote has been declining for years. In Baden-Württemberg, a CDU stronghold that holds elections in March, and in Berlin, an SPD fief that votes next autumn, the Greens are ahead of the SPD (one poll says they have also closed the gap nationally). This threatens to upend the traditional hierarchy of the centre-left parties, which Gerhard Schröder, a former SPD chancellor, likened to that of “cook and waiter.”</p>\n<p>If Germans are developing a taste for Green cuisine, it is partly because the other options look unappetising. Voters are disappointed with both the governing parties, especially the FDP, some of whose supporters are tempted by Green-tinged liberalism. The SPD is still in the throes of an identity crisis brought on by its relatively reformist record in government, which alienated its working-class base. </p>\n  <p>More important, Greens insist, is the tastiness of their own recipes. “The values and political purposes the Greens fought for for 30 years are now becoming mainstream,” says Ralf Fücks, head of the Heinrich Böll Foundation, a Green-linked think-tank. Ecology matters as much as ever but now it is seen as the driver of an innovation-fuelled “great transformation” of the economy. Rights for women (half the Greens’ political jobs are reserved for them), immigrants and gays are big themes. The state has much to do, from improving education and welfare to re-regulating finance. Reassuringly, all this is to take place within the “framework of liberal democracy and a market-based economy”, says Mr Fücks.</p>\n<p>This is radicalism plus responsibility, greenery plus growth, party politics and anti-party attitudes all at once. In pursuit of their goals the Greens are “prepared for every pragmatic compromise”, says Mr Volmer, who wrote a book about them after leaving politics. But as the party advances it will find it harder to sustain tactical agility along with fidelity to principle. </p>\n<p>Its keenest supporters are well-educated urbanites; no party’s voters are richer. Socially and economically they are as <em>bürgerlich </em>(bourgeois) as supporters of the two centre-right parties. But they vote for their values, not their interests. “We don’t represent a <em>Bürgertum</em> that thinks only of itself,” says Ms Künast.</p>\n<p>Now they are at the barricades once again. Protests erupted in September after Angela Merkel, the chancellor, decided to extend a 2022 deadline for phasing out nuclear power set by Mr Schröder’s SPD-Green coalition. In Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg’s capital, the Greens have helped lead resistance to a grand project to shift the city’s rail traffic underground. On September 30th scores of demonstrators were hurt in clashes with police. Mr Fücks sees a “danger we will fall back into hostility we thought we had overcome.”</p>\n<p>Conflict has been clarifying. The Greens had been flirting with the CDU as a possible coalition partner. This makes sense, especially since hopes of resurrecting the SPD-Green coalition have diminished now that the ex-communist Left party is established as a fifth force in the Bundestag. But a pairing with the CDU would stretch the Greens’ capacity for creative inconsistency to the limit. That option is off the table and left-right polarisation has returned, at least temporarily. </p>\n<p>The Greens will soon start to discover just how mainstream their ideas really are. Mrs Merkel has begun to attack them as enemies of progress. Plans for spending and taxing more can be made to look drearily left-wing rather than intriguingly progressive. Some analysts think the Green ascent is a political bubble. </p>\n<p>Not so, says Lothar Probst of the University of Bremen. The Greens’ middle-aged, university-educated constituency is growing as a proportion of the electorate. The party is unlikely to eclipse the SPD by the time of the next federal election in 2013, but it could catch up soon after that. The first Green chancellor will no doubt have a taste for paradox. </p>","rubric":"Germany’s Green party is flourishing","id":"17204881"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"Oktobergloom","title":"German beer drinking","content":"<p>THE morning after the night before is a time for reflection. Waking this week after the 177th Oktoberfest, Müncheners were not alone in nursing a hangover. Although festival-goers downed a record 7m litres of beer this year, <em>Braumeisters</em> are left with a painful headache of their own: the shrinking German appetite for beer. In 1991 the average German quaffed 142 litres of the stuff, but intake has declined every year since. By 2009 German consumption per head had fallen below 110 litres, less than in the Czech Republic, Ireland and Austria. Another fall is expected this year.</p>\n<p>An ageing, shrinking population is drinking less. But habits are also changing. Young people have acquired a taste for more exotic or non-alcoholic drinks. Richer people see wine as more upmarket than beer. To the disappointment of many, drinking beer at lunchtime is frowned upon. Even among the traditionally hard-boozing middle-aged, health concerns have curbed drinking. </p>\n<p>This trend is not unique to Germany: beer drinking is stable or in decline in all mature markets. But it is especially striking because of beer’s national symbolism. This is a centuries-old industry, governed by the world’s oldest food law, the 1516 <em>Reinheitsgebot</em> (purity law). Perversely, the taste for quality creates problems of its own. Mass-produced beers are derided as <em>Spülwasser</em> (dishwater). The four biggest global brewers have less than a fifth of the German market, compared with nearly half the global one. Instead, local brewers dominate, creating the most fragmented big beer market in the world. Prices are kept low by fierce competition among 1,300 breweries, more than the rest of Europe combined. Unable to cut costs or squeeze retailers’ margins, smaller brewers are struggling. </p>\n  <p>Germany has not fallen out of love with beer. It is the world’s fifth-largest market, and by far the biggest in Europe. But for the brewers, a gentle long-term decline looks inevitable. In 20 years’ time consumption may fall to as little as 80 litres per head, predicts Marc-Oliver Huhnholz of the German Brewers’ Association. “More and more breweries will have to close,” he says. “We are not sure where the journey will go.”</p>","rubric":"Producing too much, consuming too little: beer is a microcosm of Germany","id":"17204871"},{"section":"Europe","headline":"A false prophet","title":"Charlemagne","content":"<p>HIS big bleach-blond mane was unmistakable, but this time his mouth, the biggest in Dutch politics, stayed shut. Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigrant Freedom Party, is on trial for incitement to hatred and discrimination against Muslims. But when he appeared before judges in Amsterdam on October 4th, this champion of free speech declined to speak.</p>\n<p>The court heard some of Mr Wilders’s greatest hits: “the Koran is the ‘Mein Kampf’ of a religion that intends to eliminate others” (2007); “Islam wants to control, subdue and is out for the destruction of our Western civilisation” (2008); a Koran stripped of its hateful verses, “should actually have the format of a Donald Duck [comic book]” (2007, again). The judges’ questions were comically innocent. Did Mr Wilders really say such things? Was it in the heat of the moment? Had he received legal advice? Did he really need to refer to Donald Duck? Stubborn silence.</p>\n<p>Maybe the state should not be in the business of prosecuting politicians for their offensive views. But these are highly charged times in the Netherlands. The threat of murder hangs over the traditionally tolerant country. In 2002 Pim Fortuyn, an earlier anti-immigrant politician, was killed. Two years later so was Theo van Gogh, an anti-Islamist film-maker. Mr Wilders now moves only with a posse of bodyguards, and lives at a secret location.</p>\n  <p> Even more importantly, he has become the political kingmaker. His party came third in June’s general election, winning 15% of the vote, and will now prop up a minority government of the liberal VVD with the centre-right Christian Democrats. In exchange, Mr Wilders has secured the promise of tighter immigration rules, a ban on some Islamic garb and more money for care of the elderly. Newspapers are calling this the “Wilders 1” government. </p>\n<p>Mr Wilders’s party is only one of many anti-immigrant and anti-Islam groups that are gaining ground in northern European countries previously known for their liberal social attitudes. The Dutch coalition deal was copied from Denmark, where the Danish People’s Party has backed a minority government since 2001. In Sweden’s recent election the far-right Sweden Democrats won seats for the first time, denying Fredrik Reinfeldt, the prime minister, a centre-right majority (he is now running a minority government). These parties, all with their own special characteristics, are distinct from older far-right groups such as France’s National Front and Italy’s Northern League, and have still less to do with thuggish movements in eastern Europe. But a common theme is a dislike of foreigners, especially Muslims. </p>\n<p>A big question is whether Germany, the European country most inoculated from right-wing extremism, may be next. There have been stirrings of late, such as the sacking from the board of the Bundesbank of Thilo Sarrazin, a former Social Democratic politician, who published a book saying Muslim migrants were making Germany “more stupid”. Enter the inevitable Mr Wilders. He was in Berlin earlier this month to launch a new party called <em>Die Freiheit</em> (“Freedom”), founded by René Stadtkewitz, formerly a member of the Berlin branch of the Christian Democrats. To cheers, Mr Wilders declared that Germans, too, needed to defend their identity against Islamisation.</p>\n<p>Mr Wilders should not be underestimated. By identifying the enemy as Islam and not foreigners, and by casting his rhetoric in terms of freedom rather than race, he becomes harder to label as a reactionary, racist or neo-Nazi. Mr Wilders does not want to associate with the fascist sort. He has no truck with anti-Semitism and fervently supports Israel. He is, for want of a better term, a radical liberal: he defends women’s emancipation and gay rights. He is fighting to defend the West’s liberties; the enemy is Islam (not Muslims, he says), which seeks, violently, to destroy them.</p>\n<p>Such views chime with some American conservatives. The <em>Washington Times </em>this week called for Mr Wilders’s acquittal. Daniel Pipes, an American scholar and prominent scourge of Islamic radicalism, has called him “the most important European alive today.” Mr Wilders was invited to speak at a rally at New York’s Ground Zero to mark the 2001 September 11th attacks and oppose the construction of a new Islamic centre nearby. Yet Americans (and Europeans) should be wary of embracing Mr Wilders. To expose violent Islamist ideology is legitimate, even necessary; to attack Islam and the Koran is dangerous stupidity that weakens the civilisation Mr Wilders claims to defend.</p>\n<p><a name=\"defanging_the_extremes\"></a><br><strong>Defanging the extremes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>What should democratic parties do when lots of voters back a far-right party? At a time of recession, populism cannot just be wished away. One answer is to address legitimate grievances about the scale and nature of immigration.

Another is to use the law to curb blatant examples of hate speech. </p>\n<p>But the temptation for many is to isolate the extremists, perhaps with an alliance of mainstream left and right. That risks intensifying voters’ sense that politicians are not listening to them, further boosting the extremists, but it may be necessary against the most odious groups. Some, like Mr Reinfeldt in Sweden, may try to ignore the far right.

But any sense of triumphalism was notable by its absence as the Tories gathered in Birmingham. In part that was because they failed to win the May general election outright, and had to strike a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats. But the mood was also sombre because the conference came two weeks before George Osborne, the Tory chancellor of the exchequer, will reveal precisely where savage public-spending cuts will be made, as the government attempts to slash Britain’s fiscal deficit. On October 4th he gave an advance preview of one such cut: it caused an almighty ruckus, clouding out the sunnier messages from Birmingham.</p>\n<p>Mr Osborne said that from 2013 child benefit, at present paid to all mothers, would be withdrawn from families in which one parent earns enough to pay the higher rate of income tax; this year the threshold is £43,875 ($69,750). The reform, saving £1 billion a year and affecting 1.2m out of the 7.8m families who receive the benefit, was, Mr Osborne said, “tough but fair”. It was very difficult, argued the chancellor, to justify taxing people on low incomes to pay for the child benefit of those earning so much more than them. </p>\n<p>That may have sounded perfectly reasonable to Mr Osborne and David Cameron, the prime minister, but critics immediately spotted what seemed a glaringly unfair anomaly: the treatment of “stay-at-home mums”. Their families will lose child benefit if their partner’s earnings exceed the higher-rate threshold. By contrast, families where both parents earn close to the threshold could retain the benefit on joint earnings of over £80,000. Moreover, any cut to child benefit was always likely to prove neuralgic: its lineage can be traced back to family allowances, which were introduced in the mid-1940s, making it a pillar of the post-war welfare state.</p>\n  <p>Confronted by indignant mums and furious headlines in some newspapers, and with some senior Tories privately grumbling that they had not been informed of the announcement, Mr Cameron hinted at a possible inglorious retreat. The blow could be softened, he suggested, by a policy he favours but which had been shelved: a tax break for married couples. That seems implausible, since the plan has been to restrict the putative marriage perk to basic-rate taxpayers on grounds of cost. </p>\n<p>Still, even if the Conservatives’ reform was ineptly executed, it was a move in the right direction. For if the government is to have any chance of making its planned spending cuts without mutilating public services, it will have to find many more savings in the welfare bill—the biggest chunk of public expenditure, dwarfing even the National Health Service. </p>\n<p>Already in his budget in June Mr Osborne had identified £11 billion of welfare savings by 2014-15, the final year of this parliament. These will come primarily from an across-the-board switch to less generous uprating of benefits and tax credits, together with economies in specific payments. For example, a three-year freeze on child-benefit rates is already due to contribute £1 billion in 2014-15. Changes to housing benefit will save nearly £2 billion.</p>\n<p>That £11 billion may sound a lot, but by 2014 the Treasury wants to cut spending by £83 billion altogether. The welfare cuts already announced would contribute only 13% of that overall reduction, even though welfare currently makes up 28% of all public expenditure. So the chancellor probably needs to find about another £10 billion of welfare savings. </p>\n<p>The obvious target is “universal” benefits, paid to all regardless of their incomes—of which child benefit, costing around £12 billion a year, is a prime example. Now that the “universal” principle has been broken, Mr Osborne could also, for example, restrict the winter-fuel payments and free bus travel now dispensed to everyone aged 60 or over. </p>\n<p>But even if the chancellor finds a lot more savings from universal benefits, he will also need to extract some extra economies from the means-tested ones that go to poorer claimants. That will arguably be politically easier for him, now that he has demonstrated his willingness to make middle-class mums cross. Mr Osborne said last month that he intended taking away “several billions of pounds” (reportedly £4 billion a year) from the 5m working-age people who live on benefit. He added some detail in his conference speech by announcing a cap on the total amount of benefits that any one household can claim. From 2013 this will be set at the post-tax income of a typical working family, reckoned at £500 a week. That measure is likely to force some welfare-dependent families out of expensive accommodation, especially in London.</p>\n<p>But since it will affect only around 50,000 families, Mr Osborne will have to cut a lot deeper. His task will be easier than it might have been because he has struck a deal with Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory leader now in charge of most of the welfare system. The two men have been feuding over the costs involved in Mr Duncan Smith’s ambition to streamline benefits and sharpen the incentives for people to get back into work. It now appears that his reform will be introduced more gradually (stretching over two parliaments), which should reduce the initial cost from £3 billion a year to £1 billion, and lessen the risks of the upheaval being botched. </p>\n<p>Even if Mr Osborne can excise £10 billion of additional savings from the welfare bill, the spending cuts for most of the departments providing public services will be brutal, not least since it is now looking as if the Ministry of Defence will get off lightly. And the government must reckon not just with opposition among the public but among its employees. An interim report on October 7th from John Hutton, a former Labour minister whom the chancellor asked to investigate public-service pensions, suggested higher employee contributions, which will anger public-sector staff already facing a two-year pay freeze. This week’s row over child benefit, bitter and embarrassing though it has been, was merely a foretaste of the strife to come. </p>","rubric":"The controversy over restricting child benefit is a foretaste of the much greater political strife to come","id":"17209532"},{"section":"Britain","headline":"Blue on blue","title":"The Tory right","content":"<p>SINCE the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government was formed in May, most observers have looked to the Lib Dems as the main source of disaffection. Yet the big arguments within the cabinet so far have been “blue on blue”, mostly involving causes dear to the Tory right. Liam Fox, the defence secretary, has warned of the threat to the armed forces and national security posed by impending spending cuts. Until an agreement was reached recently, the zeal for welfare reform of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, received short shrift from a sceptical Treasury. Meanwhile, Ken Clarke’s liberal noises as justice secretary—he has questioned the utility of short prison sentences—have provoked anger among fellow Tories, including very senior ones. </p>\n<p>The right’s grievances with David Cameron are not only about policy. They have long regarded the prime minister’s leadership style as aloof and cliquey, and have neither forgotten nor forgiven his failure to win a general election they believed was eminently winnable. He aggravated this anger by retaining almost all the advisers responsible for the election campaign, while asking some Tory frontbenchers to make way for Lib Dems in the cabinet.</p>\n<p>For now, the right’s resentment is confined to grumbling. It helps that this wing of the party approves of the government’s main missions: cutting spending and decentralising public services. But, as Mr Cameron knows, the pacifying novelty of being in power after 13 years will wear off.</p>\n      \n  <p>The Conservatives’ autumn conference in Birmingham had been intended to soothe these disgruntled Tories. Sure enough, most of the policy announcements were popular among the grassroots. As well as his more divisive plan to withdraw child benefit from high-earning families (see <a href=\"/node/17209532\">article</a>), George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, said a limit would be set on the amount a household can claim in benefits. On October 5th Mr Clarke said prisoners should work a 40-hour week on the minimum wage, with some of their earnings going to their victims. That is the kind of prison reform that Tories can live with. The next day, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said a bill would be introduced in Parliament requiring any new transfer of power to the European Union to be put to a referendum.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest gift for the Tory base was a hint rather than a clear announcement. Responding to the child-benefit row, Mr Cameron suggested that his old plan to recognise marriage in the tax system may be revived, and perhaps even made more generous. His big speech on October 6th struck other recognisably Tory notes. He lauded wealth creators, confirmed that he would retain Britain’s nuclear deterrent and reiterated his determination to tackle welfare dependency.</p>\n<p>This kind of party management is wise, and overdue. Mr Cameron will need friends as his government is buffeted by unpopularity in the coming years. But his dilemma is that pacifying the Tory base may conflict with his simultaneous effort to portray himself as a “one nation” prime minister (see <a href=\"/node/17200399\">Bagehot</a>). In quite a smooth division of labour, Mr Osborne has gradually emerged as the de facto Tory party leader, guarding his tribe’s interests within the coalition while Mr Cameron floats above the political fray. </p>\n<p>Tories distressed by that pose should be cheered by the fact that it could prove hard to maintain. Gordon Brown played “father of the nation” in his early months as prime minister.

His shelter lacks the fat beige sofa and soft carpet in the poster above him, but it is tidy enough: a single bed tucked under wooden struts against a park wall; an anorak drying on the line; a pot and a little cookstove ready for action; and, at a distance, a pile of unholy-looking rubbish topped by an eviscerated mattress. </p>\n<p>Zdziko (his nickname), a bricklayer and plasterer in Poland, worked in Britain as a gardener until, two years ago, the jobs dried up. The 52-year-old has been sleeping rough for over a year. He hates the cold, and the thugs who recently beat him up. </p>\n<p>Home to a large industrial estate, Slough has always welcomed immigrants, and felt more than most the rapid influx of east Europeans from 2004. Zdziko is one of dozens of migrants to Slough whom the economic downturn has made homeless. But hundreds who have jobs live in conditions that are almost as bad as his. </p>\n  <p>For nearly a year, the borough council has waged war on “Slough sheds”—outbuildings including garden sheds, wooden lean-tos and garages—that some householders have rented out without planning permission or safety inspections, mainly to migrants. Prompted originally by complaints from other locals, and financed by a grant from central government (now stopped), officials have inspected these structures, street by street. </p>\n<p>“We were appalled at how dangerous some of them are,” says Keith Ford, Slough’s head of building standards, citing faulty wiring, rising damp, fire risks and dubious sanitary facilities. So far, his team has found about 500—housing more than 1,000, mainly east European migrants—that contravene safety or planning rules. They commonly rent for £130-150 ($210-240) a week. Landlords are being told to take out the cookers and lavatories and promise not to let the sheds in future without permission, or face prosecution. </p>\n<p>Even worse than the sheds are many houses in multiple occupancy, known as HMOs. Fire is their biggest hazard: a recent suit won by the council against the landlord of an unlicensed HMO found at least six people living in a three-storey house with no fire doors and a kitchen squashed in under the stairs. </p>\n<p>The council thinks Slough has 3,500 HMOs, with at least 17,500 mostly immigrant tenants, and is trying to identify them all. Later this year, officials will put forward proposals tightening the licensing requirements. They are explaining the rules to landlords and encouraging them to seek accreditation. Most are not deliberate crooks, thinks Mr Ford, but are just copying their neighbours and unaware that they are breaking the rules. </p>\n<p>Slough’s crackdown on substandard rented accommodation, which can exploit occupants and irritate residents who see their neighbourhoods degenerating, seems reasonable. But it does raise an awkward question: where do the migrants go when they lose their rooms? To date Slough has rehoused four families previously living in sheds; one left Slough and three left Britain. Some might have had help in relocating from the council’s rent-deposit scheme. As for the rest, “unfortunately we are not able to work out where they are going,” says Manju Dhar, head of private-sector housing at the council. </p>\n<p>Mandy McGuire, who runs Slough’s Homeless Our Concern (SHOC), a charity, has some ideas. The number of east Europeans who come to her day centre to shower, eat and pick up new skills has increased dramatically in the past two years, she says: 24 homeless Poles showed up on September 4th alone. </p>\n<p>Many, like Zdziko, are on the streets because they cannot find work. But the push against illegal dwellings may be a factor too. Most of the homeless are single men who never registered formally to work and are thus not entitled to much in the way of benefits. Drink and drugs are increasingly problematic, Ms McGuire says. Slough badly needs a night shelter for the homeless, she believes, but SHOC itself does not have the money to run one.</p>\n<p>Father Darius Kuwaczka, a priest at the Polish church of Divine Mercy, thinks only a few Polish migrants have returned home, one obvious solution. Others say that those who fail to make good in Britain are ashamed to go back to their families. </p>\n<p>That could be about to change. Barka, a charity that aims to repatriate destitute Polish migrants and help them get back on their feet at its centres in Poland, is now working with SHOC.

But Tony McGuirk, Merseyside’s chief fire officer, upset some people when, at a conference held during the summer by Reform, a think-tank, he said so. “We’ve got some bone idle people in the public sector,” he admitted, infuriating trade unionists. As it happens, Mr McGuirk is an expert in tackling waste: he has cut the number of fire-related deaths in Merseyside while holding down costs. </p>\n<p>In 1999-2000 there were 2,140 fires in the Merseyside area and 15 fire-related deaths; last year (2009-10), there were 1,299 and 8. Meanwhile, the number of traditional fire officers has fallen from 1,400 to 850, saving money. According to an Audit Commission report of 2008, Merseyside fire service is the country’s most efficient, relative to population. </p>\n<p>The reforms were prompted by the death of a child in 1999 that the fire service could have anticipated: in a poor family, who smoked, used a chip pan and had no fire alarm. Until then, Merseyside fire service hadn’t been much interested in social issues. Its job was to get an engine to a fire within minutes. And it did a good job in those terms: for 88% of fire fatalities, a crew arrived within five minutes of the emergency call.</p>\n  <p>Mr McGuirk saw that speedy response wasn’t enough: prevention was the key. At the time, no fire service in the country concentrated on preventing fires in the home. With the backing of the local political authorities, Mr McGuirk and his team resolved to evangelise, providing basic fire-safety advice, checking 350,000 homes and fitting 700,000 smoke alarms. They liaised with social services and recruited new kinds of staff, such as “advocates” who took the safety message into ethnic communities. </p>\n<p>All this involved cutting the number of fire officers, who, Mr McGuirk realised, were underemployed for long periods during their shifts. Anyway, fewer fires required fewer rescuers. Although no one was made redundant involuntarily, in 2006 the fire-brigade union called a strike. Protesters dubbed the fire chief “McJerk”; 2,000 of them walked through Liverpool carrying banners with slogans such as “I hate McGuirk”. </p>\n<p>Ironically, it was soon clear that the 200 officers who stayed at work could run the service at full capacity. “I told the local press they would never notice there was a strike,” says Mr McGuirk. “It’s not my job to be popular, it’s to deliver.” The strike was defeated in a month. </p>\n<p>The fire service has long been regarded by politicians and civil servants as essentially unreformable. But the Merseyside story offers hope that savings can be made in even the most intransigent public services—by preventing problems rather than merely coping with them. Mr McGuirk, in short, shows that more can indeed be done with less.</p>","rubric":"A Liverpool fireman demonstrates how it can be done","id":"17209655"},{"section":"Britain","headline":"Striking the set","title":"North Sea oil","content":"<p>THERE is a common notion that Britain is no longer a country of heavy industry. Ask anyone familiar with the North Sea, though, and that will be revealed as a myth. Giant oil platforms dot the waters between Britain and Norway, sucking around 900m barrels of oil and gas from beneath the seabed every year. The story of their construction is one of pioneering engineering prowess in one of the harshest environments on earth. The oil industry still invests more than any other industrial sector in the country: over the four decades since natural gas was discovered, it has spent more than £283 billion (in 2009 money) building the equipment necessary to bring the stuff to shore. </p>\n<p>But the industry is not what it was. Many of the old fields are spent; most of the new finds are small. Many platforms are reaching the end of their operational lives, and are starting to be decommissioned. According to Oil and Gas UK, the oil-industry trade body, around 284 installations in 144 separate fields will need to be dismantled by 2020, at a (tax-deductible) cost to the oil firms of around £9.2 billion. The costs of working offshore have risen rapidly, so the bill is swelling: five years ago, the best estimates of the ultimate cost of hauling down Britain’s entire North Sea infrastructure were around £11 billion; today’s figure is £27 billion. </p>\n<p>Strict laws forbid dumping the platforms at sea; instead they must be brought back to shore for disposal. That means a bonanza for the engineering firms, ship operators and breaker’s yards that will do the work. The scale of the job is enormous: the biggest platforms are over 300 metres high (taller than the Eiffel tower) and weigh over 20,000 tonnes. Four new decommissioning vessels are being built by specialist firms to handle these enormous structures; one—the <em>Pieter Schelte</em>, part-designed by Swan Hunter, a British shipbuilder, for the Swiss firm Allseas—will be a 382-metre, $1.7 billion monster capable of lifting a staggering 48,000 tonnes. </p>\n  <p>Two breaker’s yards, one in Newcastle (owned by Able UK) and one in the Shetland Islands (owned by Peterson SBS), are expanding their facilities in preparation. A report from Douglas-Westwood, a consulting firm, suggests that several more yards will have to be built, either in Britain or in Norway, to cope with the workload (it reckons the average platform will take around 18 months to break up). </p>\n<p>Paradoxically, the decline of Britain’s oil-production industry may help secure the future of the oil-service companies that have grown up around it. As production wanes, these firms are increasingly trying to export their offshore know-how.</p>\n<p> Oliver Sanderson, the main author of the Douglas-Westwood report, points out that although some limited experience has been gained from dismantling small platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, taking to bits installations on the scale of the North Sea’s bigger platforms remains more or less virgin territory. The firms that master the task should be able to sell their hard-won expertise to other North Sea operators, such as the Norwegians and the Dutch, and even to Far Eastern countries, many of which have platforms like those off the British coast that will have to be removed eventually. There would be a neat symmetry if a country that helped to pioneer offshore oil-drilling also pioneered the cleanup necessary once all the oil is gone. </p>","rubric":"A decommissioning bonanza brightens the twilight of Britain’s oil industry","id":"17204841"},{"section":"Britain","headline":"Upper crust","title":"Cornish pasties","content":"<p>LONDON’S Waterloo station is a long way from the sandy beaches and rugged cliffs of Cornwall, a former tin-mining county turned holiday playground in Britain’s south-west. But passing Cornishmen can ease the pain of exile with some familiar food: two stalls sell Cornish pasties, a type of savoury filled pastry. It isn’t only Waterloo: from Guildford to Glasgow, wherever there is a train station, bus terminal or shopping centre, pasty outlets are proliferating.</p>\n<p>The pasty’s unlikely conquest of Britain has been spearheaded by the West Cornwall Pasty Company, founded in 1998 by struggling bakers. Its strategy was to eschew the crowded Cornish market, instead selling pasties to the rest of the country. It worked; several years of breakneck growth followed. In 2007 the founders sold the firm to Gresham, a private equity house, for £40m; by the end of 2010 the new management plans to have 86 shops around Britain. Its success has inspired a rash of similar firms, such as Oggy Oggy and Cornish Bakehouse, to venture out of the south-west.</p>\n<p>What explains the pasty’s rise? Changes in eating habits are part of it, says Larry File of the Cornish Pasty Association (CPA), who reckons pasties are the perfect lunch for time-pressed workers. But canny marketing has helped. </p>\n  <p>Pasties—at least, a soggy, shrink-wrapped version—have long been sold in petrol stations. The new breed is more upmarket. The West Cornwall Pasty Company adroitly mixes the appeal of rustic traditionalism with modern tastes. Besides the standard filling of diced beef, potatoes, swedes and onions, it offers vegan and curry pasties too. Its larger shops are adorned with fishing boats, surfboards and other west-country icons. Customers seem to view the pasties as an “authentic”, healthier alternative to rival fast-foods (although nutritional information suggests they might be mistaken), the same characteristics that have popularised organic food.</p>\n<p>The snob appeal may strengthen should the CPA persuade the European Union to afford pasties the “protected geographical status” enjoyed by, for example, Gorgonzola cheese and Prosciutto ham. That would stop non-Cornish producers from calling their offerings Cornish pasties.

They are a relatively lucky lot. As Britain limps out of recession and jobs remain scarce, higher education makes an appealing alternative to the dole queue; many people who would normally have earned a place have been denied one. Even before the downturn, demand outstripped supply. Finding a way to accommodate this pent-up demand even as public spending is squeezed is likely to prove controversial, and potentially destabilising, for the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.</p>\n<p>Five decades ago, when just 5% of youngsters entered higher education, the state paid not only for their tuition but also for their living expenses, including beer money. Now that 45% of young people do so, things have changed. A series of botched reforms by successive governments that were supposed to pave the way for the country’s transition from an elite to a mass system have left universities unable to enroll all the students who qualify. </p>\n<p>Tony Blair’s government introduced university tuition fees in 1998. This year, a student enrolled at an English university must contribute £3,290 towards the costs of his education—which, on average, is less than half of the actual annual cost. The state pays the difference (at least notionally: some universities complain that they are left out of pocket). The state also lends students the money to pay their fees and living expenses, charging no interest on the loans in real terms and recouping what it can after the students graduate and are earning more than £15,000 a year. Small wonder, then, that even before the coalition starts to slash public spending, the state can’t afford to let universities admit as many students as they would like.</p>\n  <p>A way out of this fix is due to be outlined on October 12th by an independent review of higher education and student finance, headed by Lord Browne, a former head of BP. The review is expected to suggest that graduates should pay more so that taxpayers can pay less. Lord Browne is likely to recommend that the maximum annual tuition fee—perhaps to be rebranded as a “graduate contribution”—should rise to £7,000 or more (leaving some universities free to charge much less). That is close to the average actual cost of teaching an undergraduate.</p>\n<p>If that hike were implemented, it could cost the state a lot, because it would still be lending most students the money to pay the increased fees (about 80% of the 960,000 students eligible for such loans currently take them). So Lord Browne will probably also recommend that the government charge a proper rate of interest on its loans. Nick Barr, of the London School of Economics, calculates that, under the present system, students pay back only two-thirds of the real cost of their loans. He reckons the main beneficiaries are successful professionals, who cease paying for their degrees ten years after graduation, rather than the 12 or so years it would take should real interest be charged. </p>\n\n<p>These adjustments would dramatically increase private spending on universities. At almost 50%, that already forms a higher proportion of the total expenditure in Britain than in many other members of the OECD, a club for rich countries. Yet Britain spends just 1.3% of its GDP on higher education, lower than the OECD average (see chart); since students are the main beneficiaries of their degrees, they are the obvious sources of additional funding.</p>\n<p> Sensible as the review’s suggestions might be, however, they may prove difficult to enact—because the Lib Dems promised to abolish tuition fees in their election manifesto and have secured the right to abstain from any vote on legislation arising from the Browne review. Most Lib Dems favour a graduate tax, under which graduates would pay more tax than those who had not completed a degree. Vince Cable, the business secretary who is also responsible for universities, has tried to smooth the path to this solution by describing the existing system as “a form of graduate tax” (it can more accurately be called a defined graduate contribution, perhaps, because graduates pay only what they owe, rather than indefinitely). </p>\n<p>The graduate tax has obvious drawbacks. It would encourage students to quit before they graduate or to move abroad afterwards. It is hard to see why some students should pay more than others for the same service. And well-paid graduates already contribute more than others via income tax. A graduate tax would also leave universities largely reliant on state funding, whereas raising fees would boost their financial independence. (Another idea, supported by some universities but vulnerable to similar objections, would be to charge high-earning graduates a steeper interest rate on their loans.)</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_least_worst_option\"></a><br><strong>The least worst option</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the government were to invent an emollient new name for tuition fees, and guarantee that payments can still be deferred until after graduation, it might be able to pass legislation that would permit fees to rise. That would alarm students (and parents) unaccustomed to the idea of taking on such daunting levels of debt. Some graduates would end up paying for their education for much of their working lives. </p>\n<p>There is an even more uncomfortable possibility, however. On October 20th, when it announces the results of its spending review, the government is expected to slash its direct funding of university teaching. The cuts will be made in anticipation of the revenue that Lord Browne’s plans would raise if they were adopted. What worries Steve Smith, head of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, is that the Lib Dems might block the reforms, leaving universities with a huge shortfall. If that happens, many more would-be students will miss out. </p>","rubric":"Students may soon be asked to pay more for their degrees—if the coalition government can agree the necessary reforms","id":"17209675"},{"section":"Britain","headline":"Keep calm, but don't carry on","title":"Bagehot","content":"<p>VISIT any British office, and you stand a good chance of seeing a postcard, mug or other trinket bearing the message “Keep Calm and Carry On”, beneath the crown of King George VI.

It taps directly into the country’s mythic image of itself: unshowily brave and just a little stiff, brewing tea as the bombs fall.</p>\n<p>The “Keep Calm” slogan being already taken, the Conservative Party had to make do with a Churchillian pastiche of its own devising—“Together in the National Interest”—at its annual conference in Birmingham this week. This was everywhere: emblazoned across the main stage, hanging from banners and slipped in some guise into every minister’s speech. In contrast, the word “Conservative” seemed almost banished. It is dangerous to infer too much from martial bluster in British politics: at the first hint of trouble, channelling Churchill is a default tactic for beleaguered leaders of all sorts. Yet even so, senior Tories showed unusual zeal in presenting themselves as a movement of national unity.</p>\n<p>The chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, harked back to a few days in spring when the country stood on the brink of an economic “abyss”. He praised David Cameron for seeing that the “national interest” demanded coalition with the Liberal Democrats.

In countries where coalitions are the norm, voters would fall about at the idea that multi-party rule involves putting aside partisan strife. But in Britain the last formal coalition was a wartime government of national unity, a fact that lingers in the folk memory. The whiff of cordite is also helpful to the coalition’s drive to portray Mr Osborne’s plan for eliminating most of the structural deficit within five years as a campaign of necessity rather than political choice. It implies that opposition to it is unpatriotic, or at least extreme.</p>\n<p>This bid to depict the Tories as somehow above mere party politics was intensely personalised. Ministerial tributes to Mr Cameron repeatedly portrayed him as a visionary who understood the need for national unity, and the guarantor that coalition rule will be “tough but fair”. Again and again, Mr Cameron’s own personality and biography were offered up as proof that today’s Conservatives are a moderate, post-partisan party. </p>\n<p>Talk to Tory sources, and their descriptions of the coalition sound strangely like Mr Cameron, their well-brought up boss. After Labour’s “arrogant”, chaotic decision-making on a Downing Street sofa, it is said, this coalition is made up of two parties that are “polite to each other” and take decisions “properly” round a table. Even Mr Cameron (a sleeves-rolled-up chap keen on decency and responsibility) drifts close to self-referential tributes, hailing his government for “rolling up its sleeves” and “putting aside political interests” to “do the right thing”.</p>\n<p>Standing by his pledge to preserve the National Health Service from spending cuts, Mr Cameron told the BBC that this might sound a surprising policy from “a Conservative Party”. Well, he said, it was not a surprise from “the sort of Conservative Party that I lead.” Midway through conference week, a gigantic kerfuffle broke out after Mr Osborne announced a plan to take away child benefit from higher-rate taxpayers, triggering howls from the conservative press that the party was anti-family. Mr Cameron backed his chancellor, but swiftly took his wife and newborn baby, Florence, for a stroll around a conference hotel that just happened to be full of photographers.</p>\n<p><a name=\"panic_and_freak_out\"></a><br><strong>Panic and freak out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mr Cameron is good at carrying off such hokum without blushing: a skill not to be undervalued in a politician. He remains more popular than his party in opinion polls, and his biography, notably years of caring for a gravely disabled son, Ivan, who died in 2009, does buttress his claim to understand the importance of public services. But there are big risks to an approach so closely tied to one man’s personal reputation.</p>\n<p>For one thing, personal trust is a fragile and easily damaged asset. For another, few of Mr Cameron’s close colleagues can carry off the “tough but fair” combination with his assurance. Mr Osborne, a partisan street fighter beneath his languidly posh exterior, unexpectedly declared himself a “one nation” Conservative in his conference speech and declared that much of the welfare budget was “money well spent”. But then he told a cheering hall (with the faintest curl of the lip) that if people thought living on benefits was a “lifestyle choice” then “we need to make them think again.” The combined effect strained credulity.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the temptation to paint the prime minister as a post-partisan father of the nation muddles his message: for better or worse, his coalition has bold and risky plans for shaking up the country. The country wants “leadership not partisanship” Mr Cameron said in his conference speech. But he also said: “Let’s leave Labour defending the status quo…We are the radicals now.” Keep calm, by all means. But the coalition does not want to carry on as before. It cannot have it both ways. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"David Cameron can’t be both a radical and a father of the nation","id":"17200399"},{"section":"International","headline":"Unholy rows","title":"Holy places","content":"<p>ACROSS northern India, householders who were braced for a bout of violent sectarian strife are sighing with relief. The people most affected by one of the world’s biggest arguments over sacred turf, in the town of Ayodhya, seemed to accept the verdict, even if it was not quite what they wanted. On September 30th judges in the state of Uttar Pradesh ruled that the contested site should be split between Hindus and Muslims, with the latter getting a third.</p>\n<p>“We must abide by the court’s decision and move on,” declared Mohammed Hashim Ansari, a 90-year-old Muslim who has been involved in litigation over the site since 1961. Such stoicism is impressive. As a boy, he had prayed in a fine sandstone mosque, the Babri Masjid, which had stood on the site since the 16th century. In 1992 Hindus tore it down. They believe their god-king Ram was born there. About 2,000 people died in the ensuing violence. In the run-up to the latest verdict, many feared more bloodshed. But India’s prime minister and other public figures hailed the compromise ruling and the calm reaction as a sign of maturing attitudes. </p>\n<p> The news is less encouraging in the holy land, where amid floundering peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, acrimony over sacred turf is surging to new extremes. In a West Bank village near Bethlehem, locals say that on October 4th hard-line Jewish settlers set fire to their mosque and torched copies of the Koran. Tempers cooled a little a day later when a group of settler rabbis delivered replacement copies of the holy book, in an unusual gesture of reconciliation.</p>\n  <p> Elsewhere in Jerusalem and the West Bank, the mood is at its bleakest in places which more than one faith deems sacred. Take the site in Nablus that many Jews revere as the grave of Joseph, the biblical patriarch. Muslims associate the place with an Islamic holy man who died 200 years ago. In the 19th century, it was amicably frequented by Muslims, Jews and Christians. Recently it has become a battleground. From the 1980s a zealous Jewish group developed a study centre and synagogue, even though the surrounding area was run by the Palestinians. In October 2000, after much bitter fighting, the Israelis ceded the site to Palestinian control; the Jewish synagogue was immediately trashed. </p>\n\n<p>In recent months, as a goodwill gesture, the Palestinians agreed to restore the place and give renewed access to Jews. But they may be ruing their decision. Within hours of the restoration’s completion, about 1,000 Israeli pilgrims arrived in armoured vehicles and bulletproof buses. Israeli military jeeps closed the roads and imposed a curfew on local Palestinians. In the alleys next to the Balata refugee camp, Jewish worshippers danced the night away to a raucous beat. Such night-time incursions are planned at least once a month. </p>\n<p>The renovation was meant to mark a new era of co-operation over holy places. A few weeks ago Israel’s chief rabbis went to Nablus to rededicate the shrine. The tomb’s dome is again whitewashed, despite requests by Muslims to paint it green, the colour of Islam. </p>\n<p> Religious conflict, not rapprochement, seems to be the aim of some hotheads. The rabbinic circle of Israel’s main settler council, Yesha, has denounced the hiring of an Arab to restore the shrine. Tzipi Hotobelli, a parliamentary ally of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, added her voice to calls for a full Jewish takeover. “The tomb should be under Jewish sovereignty,” she said. Students who had once studied the Torah in the tomb have ambitious ideas for another kind of two-state solution: a Torah-compliant state in Judea, as they call the main bit of the West Bank, and a sinful secular state of Israel nearby.</p>\n<p> In more liberal circles, dedicated to interfaith harmony, the point is often made that the figure of Abraham or Ibrahim unites all three monotheistic faiths. But the burial-place in Hebron of Abraham and his wife Sarah is perhaps the region’s most contested place after Jerusalem. After Israel’s takeover in 1967, access to the place was at first divided carefully between Jews and Muslims. But especially since 1994, when a Jewish extremist killed 29 Muslims, the mood has grown ever-darker. The need to control the tomb is one of the reasons Israelis give for holding on to Hebron, where 160,000 Palestinians live at odds with 500 hardline settlers. A little to the north, the tomb of the biblical matriarch, Rachel, is now surrounded by an Israeli garrison with an eight-metre-high wall jutting into Bethlehem. This prevents nearby Christians and Muslims from visiting the place, as they used to. </p>\n<p> Muslims complain of being kept from other places as well. In the heart of Yitzhar settlement, in the hills above Nablus, the dome-topped shrine of Sheikh Salman al-Farisi is now barred to Muslims. A spokesman for Yitzhar says that, for security reasons, “Arabs are not allowed in Jewish settlements.” Many of Yitzhar’s residents are raised on the teachings of Yitzchak Ginsburgh, an American rabbi, who ran a Torah school at Joseph’s tomb before Palestinians chased it out. Israel jailed him after he praised the Hebron massacre. But his disciples are undeterred. This year Jewish radicals have vandalised or assaulted four mosques. One is in Silwan in East Jerusalem, a poor Arab area that settlers covet.</p>\n<p> For all the rhetoric of ancient hatred, religious rows have grown worse in modern times. Across the Ottoman empire, from the Balkans to Anatolia to Palestine, Christians and Muslims mingled peaceably at shared sacred places. That survives in some locations: on the island of Buyukada near Istanbul, where Muslim pilgrims climb a steep hill to a Greek monastery; in the Christian convent of Seidnaya near Damascus, popular with Muslim women who long to conceive; and at the ancient monastery on Mount Sinai, where Muslim Bedouins revere St Catherine.</p>\n<p> Scholars of religion argue intensely about this. Glenn Bowman of the University of Kent sees the sharing of holy places as a natural state of affairs which can be undermined only by political or religious elites. His research demonstrates the roles of Israeli officials, Islamists and Greek bishops in marring the harmony between Christians and Muslims who frequented a monastic site near Bethlehem.</p>\n<p> Robert Hayden of the University of Pittsburgh is more pessimistic. He sees site-sharing as a temporary truce between a dominant and subordinate faith, or else an arrangement imposed by an imperial power, say Ottoman or British, for the sake of social peace. Among the best-known sharing regimes is the one for the six Christian communities that vie for control of Jerusalem’s Holy Sepulchre. With precise allocations for every side-chapel and every lamp, the system was devised by the Ottomans, inherited by the British, and is now run by the Israelis.</p>\n<p> Indians sometimes claim that Hindus and Muslims mingled happily in the era before British rule. Mr Hayden points to cases where the British just held the ring, until independence allowed a local group, usually Hindu, to gain the upper hand.</p>\n<p>A contrasting and more optimistic historical perspective comes from Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief Hindu priest at a makeshift temple to Ram built where the mosque once stood. Until the site was politicised by Hindu hardliners, both faiths had rubbed along, he insists. Hindus and Muslims prayed inside the complex for many years, and he hopes that they will do so again. “Local people wouldn’t have any problem with a mosque and a temple being built on the site now the verdict has come,” declares the priest. Perhaps he should visit Israel. </p>","rubric":"Holy places should unite humanity.

But the water table has dropped by ten metres since 1973 and the rate of decline is accelerating on both the Indian and the Pakistani sides of the region.

Springs are drying up and soil salinity has increased. </p>\n\n<p>Such depletion of aquifers is a classic tragedy of the commons. Farmers pump, oblivious of others’ actions or the impact of their own. Scarcity stokes this rather than braking it.

Powerful farming lobbies have little interest in changing the status quo.</p>\n<p>Aquifers, like fish stocks, are most at risk when they cross national borders, making property rights weaker. Groundwater provides about a fifth of the planet’s water needs and half its drinking water. In arid countries such as Libya or Saudi Arabia, that figure is close to 100%. Almost 96% of the planet’s freshwater resources are stored as groundwater, half of which straddles borders.

Lifting sanctions on Libya has had an effect, too.

Experts are still refining the count: the American-Mexico border may include 8, 10, 18 or 20 aquifers, depending on how you measure them. Defining sustainability vexes hydrologists too, particularly with ancient fossil aquifers that will inevitably run dry eventually.

A flurry of headline-grabbing suits followed. Nine Nigerians, including relatives of Ken Saro-Wiwa, a playwright, accused Shell of complicity in human-rights abuses. Vietnamese villagers sued Dow Chemical and others for injuries caused by the Agent Orange herbicide. </p>\n<p>This avenue was abruptly closed recently when the second circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled on September 17th that corporations could not be held liable under the Alien Tort Claims Act for breaches of international law abroad.

Both companies and their accusers reckoned that the courts treated the principle of liability as a given.</p>\n<p> The decision, if upheld, will bring new clarity and an end to such lawsuits. But until all avenues of appeal are exhausted, the precedent will not be firmly set. The Supreme Court declined on October 4th to rule immediately on the specific question of whether corporations could be held liable under international law.

In some 60 cases so far, the plaintiffs have gained plenty of publicity, but won no outright victories. (Shell settled out of court, as did Unocal.) Adopted in 1789, possibly to target pirates, the statute allows for civil actions by aliens for wrongful acts “committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States”. Its cloudy origins make room for creative interpretation by human-rights campaigners and companies alike and have caused much confusion in the courts.</p>\n<p>That can be seen in the strongly worded dissent written by Judge Pierre Leval in the New York case on the central question of whether corporations are covered by international laws that explicitly mention only states and natural persons.

There are plenty of potential candidates, from the remaking of finance in the wake of the crash of 2008 to the explosion of sovereign debt. But the list will almost certainly be topped by the dramatic shift in global economic heft. </p>\n<p> Ten years ago rich countries dominated the world economy, contributing around two-thirds of global GDP after allowing for differences in purchasing power. Since then that share has fallen to just over half. In another decade it could be down to 40%. The bulk of global output will be produced in the emerging world. </p>\n<p> The pace of the shift testifies to these countries’ success. Thanks to globalisation and good policies, virtually all developing countries are catching up with their richer peers. In 2002-08 more than 85% of developing economies grew faster than America’s, compared with less than a third between 1960 and 2000, and virtually none in the century before that. </p>\n      \n  <p> This “rise of the rest” is a remarkable achievement, bringing with it unprecedented improvements in living standards for the majority of people on the planet. But there is another, less happy, explanation for the rapid shift in the global centre of economic gravity: the lack of growth in the big rich economies of America, western Europe and Japan. That will be the focus of this special report.</p>\n\n<p>The next few years could be defined as much by the stagnation of the West as by the emergence of the rest, for three main reasons. The first is the sheer scale of the recession of 2008-09 and the weakness of the subsequent recovery. For the advanced economies as a whole, the slump that followed the global financial crisis was by far the deepest since the 1930s. It has left an unprecedented degree of unemployed workers and underused factories in its wake. Although output stopped shrinking in most countries a year ago, the recovery is proving too weak to put that idle capacity back to work quickly (see chart 1). The OECD, the Paris-based organisation that tracks advanced economies, does not expect this “output gap” to close until 2015.</p>\n<p> The second reason to worry about stagnation has to do with slowing supply. The level of demand determines whether economies run above or below their “trend” rate of growth, but that trend rate itself depends on the supply of workers and their productivity. That productivity in turn depends on the rate of capital investment and the pace of innovation. Across the rich world the supply of workers is about to slow as the number of pensioners rises. In western Europe the change will be especially marked. Over the coming decade the region’s working-age population, which until now has been rising slowly, will shrink by some 0.3% a year. In Japan, where the pool of potential workers is already shrinking, the pace of decline will more than double, to around 0.7% a year. America’s demography is far more favourable, but the growth in its working-age population, at some 0.3% a year over the coming two decades, will be less than a third of the post-war average.</p>\n\n<p> With millions of workers unemployed, an impending slowdown in the labour supply might not seem much of a problem. But these demographic shifts set the boundaries for rich countries’ medium-term future, including their ability to service their public debt. Unless more immigrants are allowed in, or a larger proportion of the working-age population joins the labour force, or people retire later, or their productivity accelerates, the ageing population will translate into permanently slower potential growth. </p>\n<p> Calculations by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and Khuong Vu of the National University of Singapore make the point starkly. They show that the average underlying annual growth rate of the G7 group of big rich economies between 1998 and 2008 was 2.1%. On current demographic trends, and assuming that productivity improves at the same rate as in the past ten years, that potential rate of growth will come down to 1.45% a year over the next ten years, its slowest pace since the second world war. </p>\n<p> Faster productivity growth could help to mitigate the slowdown, but it does not seem to be forthcoming. Before the financial crisis hit, the trend in productivity growth was flat or slowing in many rich countries even as it soared in the emerging world. Growth in output per worker in America, which had risen sharply in the late 1990s thanks to increased output of information technology, and again in the early part of this decade as the gains from IT spread throughout the economy, began to flag after 2004. It revived during the recession as firms slashed their labour force, but that boost may not last. Japan’s productivity slumped after its bubble burst in the early 1990s. Western Europe’s, overall, has also weakened since the mid-1990s. </p>\n<p> The third reason to fret about the rich world’s stagnation is that the hangover from the financial crisis and the feebleness of the recovery could themselves dent economies’ potential. Long periods of high unemployment tend to reduce rather than augment the pool of potential workers. The unemployed lose their skills, and disillusioned workers drop out of the workforce. The shrinking of banks’ balance-sheets that follows a financial bust makes credit more costly and harder to come by. </p>\n\n<p> Optimists point to America’s experience over the past century as evidence that recessions, even severe ones, need not do lasting damage. After every downturn the economy eventually bounced back so that for the period as a whole America’s underlying growth rate per person remained remarkably stable (see chart 2). Despite a lack of demand, America’s underlying productivity grew faster in the 1930s than in any other decade of the 20th century. Today’s high unemployment may also be preparing the ground for more efficient processes. </p>\n<p> Most economists, however, reckon that rich economies’ capacity has already sustained some damage, especially in countries where much of the growth came from bubble industries like construction, as in Spain, and finance, as in Britain. The OECD now reckons that the fallout from the financial crisis will, on average, knock some 3% off rich countries’ potential output. Most of that decline has already occurred. </p>\n<p> The longer that demand remains weak, the greater the damage is likely to be. Japan’s experience over the past two decades is a cautionary example, especially to fast-ageing European economies. The country’s financial crash in the early 1990s contributed to a slump in productivity growth. Soon afterwards the working-age population began to shrink. A series of policy mistakes caused the hangover from the financial crisis to linger. The economy failed to recover and deflation set in. The result was a persistent combination of weak demand and slowing supply. </p>\n<p> To avoid Japan’s fate, rich countries need to foster growth in two ways, by supporting short-term demand and by boosting long-term supply. Unfortunately, today’s policymakers often see these two strategies as alternatives rather than complements. Many of the Keynesian economists who fret about the lack of private demand think that concerns about economies’ medium-term potential are beside the point at the moment. They include Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and commentator in the <em>New York Times</em>, and many of President Barack Obama’s economic team. </p>\n<p><a name=\"stimulus_v_austerity\"></a><br><strong>Stimulus v austerity</strong>\n</p>\n<p> European economists put more emphasis on boosting medium-term growth, favouring reforms such as making labour markets more flexible. They tend to reject further fiscal stimulus to prop up demand. Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, is a strong advocate of structural reforms in Europe. But he is also one of the most ardent champions of the idea that cutting budget deficits will itself boost growth. All this has led to a passionate but narrow debate about fiscal stimulus versus austerity. </p>\n\n<p> This special report will argue that both sides are blinkered. Governments should think more coherently about how to support demand and boost supply at the same time. The exact priorities will differ from country to country, but there are several common themes. First, the Keynesians are right to observe that, for the rich world as a whole, there is a danger of overdoing the short-term budget austerity. Excessive budget-cutting poses a risk to the recovery, not least because it cannot easily be offset by looser monetary policy. Improvements to the structure of taxation and spending matter as much as the short-term deficits.</p>\n<p> Second, there is an equally big risk of ignoring threats to economies’ potential growth and of missing the opportunity for growth-enhancing microeconomic reforms. Most rich-country governments have learned one important lesson from previous financial crises: they have cleaned up their banking sectors reasonably quickly. But more competition and deregulation deserve higher billing, especially in services, which in all rich countries are likely to be the source of most future employment and productivity growth. </p>\n<p>Instead, too many governments are determined to boost innovation by reinventing industrial policy. Making the jobless more employable should be higher on the list, especially in America, where record levels of long-term unemployment suggest that labour markets may not be as flexible as many people believe.</p>\n<p> Faster growth is not a silver bullet. It will not eliminate the need to trim back unrealistic promises to pensioners; no rich country can simply grow its way out of looming pension and health-care commitments. Nor will it stop the relentless shift of economic gravity to the emerging world. Since developing economies are more populous than rich ones, they will inevitably come to dominate the world economy. But whether that shift takes place against a background of prosperity or stagnation depends on the pace of growth in the rich countries. For the moment, worryingly, too many of them seem to be headed for stagnation. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"Without faster growth the rich world’s economies will be stuck.

The federal debt held by the public was $8.9 trillion in August 2010, or about 60% of GDP. Add to that the Treasury debt held by America’s public-pension scheme, and the national debt reached $10 trillion back in September 2008. The extra digit obliged the national debt clock near New York’s Times Square to move its dollar sign to make room.</p>\n<p> Many of today’s Americans feel as indignant about the debt as that 1940s housewife did. But they are just as profligate as their government (see chart 4). Their mortgages and other debts also amount to around $13 trillion, almost 120% of their annual disposable income.</p>\n\n      \n  <p>The most remarkable thing about that figure, though, is not how big it is, but that it is smaller than it was two years ago. For over 60 years after the second world war, household debt moved in only one direction: upwards. Then, in the second quarter of 2008, it started to fall—not just as a proportion of income, or after allowing for inflation, but in everyday dollars and cents. Between March 1st 2008 and June 30th 2010 households reduced their debts by $473 billion. Businesses and banks joined in later. Although the federal debt displayed on the Times Square clock is ticking remorselessly upwards, the true national debt, including households, banks and firms, is now lower than it was in the first quarter of 2009.</p>\n<p> In 2008-09, for the first time since the 1930s Depression, consumer spending in real terms fell for two years in a row. Households are now saving 6% of their disposable income, compared with just 2.7% in the years before the crisis. Combined with the stockmarket’s fitful rallies, this frugality has helped American households rebuild some of the wealth washed away by the recession. Their net worth is now about 490% of their disposable income, compared with just 440% in the worst months of the crisis. As a cushion against a riskier world, American households will probably try to set aside a stash of assets worth some 540-550% of their income, according to Martin Sommer of the IMF and Jirka Slacalek of the European Central Bank. If that figure is right, their balance-sheet repairs are currently only half completed.</p>\n\n<p>This new thrift is not confined to America. Household debt is also falling in Spain. In Britain households saved 6.3% of their disposable income in 2009 (though less in the first half of 2010), compared with 2% in 2008. Nor is the frugality limited to households. In the wake of the financial crisis, companies across the rich world have been piling up cash. Small firms have been unable, and many big firms have been unwilling, to borrow. In Japan and Britain corporate investment fell by about a quarter from peak to trough. The pace of investment has recovered somewhat, but companies are still not rushing to add new factories and machinery when so much of their existing capacity lies idle. </p>\n<p>All told, across the OECD households and businesses are forecast to spend $2.6 trillion less than their incomes this year, the equivalent of 7% of GDP. This follows another huge private-sector surplus, of 7.2%, the year before. In 2007, by contrast, the rich world’s households and businesses ran a combined deficit. This astonishing rise in private saving is the main reason why the recession was so deep and the recovery is so muted. After two years of private-sector austerity in the rich countries, the biggest macroeconomic controversy now facing their governments is whether to embrace some austerity of their own.</p>\n<p><a name=\"squirrel_it_away\"></a><br><strong>Squirrel it away</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Squirrels save by burying nuts in the ground. In sophisticated economies, people save by amassing financial claims on someone else. Savers therefore need borrowers. In textbook economics households save and banks use those savings to lend to firms. For both households and firms to run a surplus, someone else must run a deficit. That someone else could be a foreign nation. But none of the economies outside the OECD is big enough to absorb the excess private saving of the rich world. China would have to run a current-account deficit of over 40% of GDP to offset a $2.6 trillion surplus. Even if the task were spread across all the Asian countries outside the OECD (of which Japan and South Korea are members), they would have to run deficits of over 25% each. </p>\n<p> The only other possibility is governments. That is why the rich world’s private surpluses have been mirrored by equally vast public deficits. Last year the OECD’s governments ran a combined deficit of 7.9% of GDP, and this year it is likely to be only marginally less. Among the big economies, Britain’s deficit will be the largest, at 11.5%, with America not far behind. In an accounting sense, these eye-popping deficits are simply the counterpart of private surpluses. In an economic sense, their remarkable increase is less the outcome of government profligacy than private thrift. </p>\n<p>According to the IMF, when the final bill for the budgetary cost of the crisis is calculated a few years hence, the unpopular bank bail-outs and fiscals splash-outs will account for less than 30% of it. The rest will be down to the crisis itself, which squeezed revenues and reduced growth.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its source, borrowing on this scale plays havoc with the public finances. According to the IMF, gross government debt in the world’s big rich economies reached 97% last year and is rising at its fastest pace in modern history. By 2015 the IMF expects them to have a combined debt burden of 110% of GDP, against less than 70% in 2007.</p>\n<p> Earlier this year fears about soaring public deficits and debt in some countries seemed about to bring on another financial meltdown, thanks to Greece’s brush with default. More than 200 years ago America’s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, warned of the “extravagant premium” countries must pay if their credit is “questionable”. This spring Greece’s credit was severely questioned. The premium, or spread, it had to pay on its bonds, relative to German bunds, rose extravagantly, from about 2% at the start of the year to almost 10% at the height of the crisis in May. Spreads on Irish, Portuguese and, to a lesser extent, Spanish debt also spiked. These fears re-emerged in September, particularly in Ireland.</p>\n<p> Greece had to be bailed out by the EU and the IMF. Along with other wobbly euro-zone borrowers, it was forced to make radical budget cuts. But the Greek crisis had a palpable effect even on countries under no obvious pressure from financial markets, especially Britain, where the new coalition government announced tax increases and dramatic cuts in spending. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, these are even tougher than the cuts imposed on Britain by the IMF in 1976. </p>\n<p> In America bond yields are near record lows and the economy is slowing, but the government’s efforts to introduce a second stimulus have foundered (though it is now trying again). Much of the political debate in Washington, DC, is about the scale of fiscal tightening; in particular, whether to allow any of the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of this year, as scheduled. </p>\n<p> Even though the rich world’s economies continue to operate below capacity, in 2011 they are heading for what is likely to be their biggest collective budget squeeze in at least four decades. The appetite for government releveraging is coming to an end before private deleveraging is over. </p>\n<p><a name=\"too_soon_to_tighten\"></a><br><strong>Too soon to tighten?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Is this a mistake? Economists are deeply divided. Many Keynesians think the answer is yes. They fret that the costs and risks of higher public debt are wildly exaggerated, and that as long as households are cutting back and economies are operating so far below their potential, governments should not try to trim public deficits. </p>\n<p> Nonsense, say the advocates of austerity, pointing to the fickleness of financial markets and to the dangers government debt poses to long-term growth. Many claim that fiscal austerity could even boost growth in the short term. By reducing the spectre of massive government debt, it would lift private confidence and unlock spending. Entrepreneurs would be emboldened to invest and households might feel freer to spend, without fear of future tax increases to help repay the debt.</p>\n<p>Keynesians are right that deficits, so far, have been more a symptom than a source of economic distress. The fiscal swing undoubtedly helped to contain the damage from the crisis. Without it the private sector’s determination to save would have depressed spending across the economy even further. That would have caused a correspondingly steeper fall in incomes, making it harder for households to repair their balance-sheets.</p>\n<p>Nor are most rich countries anywhere close to the limits of what they can borrow. A new study from the IMF suggests that most advanced economies still have plenty of “fiscal space”. In America and Britain, for instance, the fund’s economists calculate that public debt will not reach its absolute limit until it hits 160% of GDP or more, far higher than its current levels. The wolf is not at the door.</p>\n<p>But termites are in the woodwork, as Charles Schultze, a former White House official, once put it. Governments have big underlying structural budget gaps that will not be filled by economic recovery. Rising health-care and pension spending will put relentless pressure on government debt. Eventually the rich world’s economies will return to full employment, and when they do, public borrowing will crowd out private investment and hurt growth.</p>\n<p>How much damage can these termites do, and when does it get serious? Carmen Reinhart of the University of Maryland and Ken Rogoff of Harvard University have examined the effects of a couple of centuries of sovereign debt. Their verdict is that public debt does little discernible harm until it reaches about 90% of a country’s GDP, but then the effect on growth can be sudden and big. </p>\n<p><a name=\"so_far_and_no_farther\"></a><br><strong>So far and no farther</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Other scholars reach somewhat grimmer conclusions. Looking at 99 countries since 1980, Mehmet Caner and Thomas Grennes of North Carolina State University with Fritzi Koehler-Geib of the World Bank identified a threshold of 77% of GDP. Every member of the G7 will breach that limit this year. If the authors have got it right, these debts will knock half a percentage point off the collective growth rate of the G20’s rich members.</p>\n\n<p>The IMF says governments should aspire to cut their debt ratios back to 60% by 2030. To do so they will have to perform some fiscal heroics. Their budgets will have to swing from a projected underlying primary deficit of 4.9% of GDP in 2010 (see chart 5) to a surplus of 3.8% by 2020 and stay there for a decade, even as ageing populations add 4-5% of GDP to their fiscal costs. In America, Britain, Greece, Ireland, Japan and Spain a swing of 9% or more of GDP is required. </p>\n<p>Given the scale of the task, it seems best not to put it off for too long, especially since economies are no longer shrinking, just growing slowly. Numerous studies suggest that consolidation based on spending cuts is more likely to stick, and will do more to boost medium-term growth, than measures involving tax increases. Cutting public-sector wages and welfare payments is better than cutting government investment. </p>\n<p>Putting in place reforms that slow down the rise in pension and health-care spending ought to be a particular priority, since the net present value of governments’ promises to the elderly dwarf today’s debts. Raising the retirement age is a particularly good idea because it simultaneously cuts governments’ liabilities and boosts future growth and tax revenue as people work longer. If revenues must be raised, taxes on consumption and property are less harmful to growth than those on income or saving. </p>\n<p> By these standards most rich-country fiscal-consolidation plans score reasonably well. Britain’s government plans to squeeze three-quarters of its budget adjustment from spending cuts. In Greece the share is 51% and in Spain 62%. Several European countries are raising their statutory retirement ages, albeit in small steps. Where there have been tax increases, they have mostly been on VAT. By comparison, America’s fiscal plans—a rise in taxes on income and capital if the Bush cuts expire, and no progress on reforming pensions or health-care spending—are much worse. </p>\n<p>However, the advocates of austerity tend to exaggerate the beneficial effect on short-term growth of such contractions (even if properly designed). Alberto Alesina and Silvia Ardagna of Harvard University have identified many examples of economies that expanded even as their deficits were squeezed through spending cuts (though not tax increases), yet a study in the IMF’s latest <em>World Economic Outlook</em> shows that in some of their examples the deficits were not really squeezed. </p>\n<p>For instance, in 1998 Japan’s government injected over ¥24 trillion into Japan National Railway; in the following year it did not. Between those two years its budget balance appeared to improve by about 4.8% of GDP even though it had neither cut spending nor raised taxes. Similarly, in 1995 Germany’s government took on east German housing and industrial debts worth about 6.8% of GDP. The following year its budget seemed to improve dramatically after that one-off event—even though there had been no squeeze.</p>\n<p>The IMF’s researchers looked at countries that actually raised taxes or cut spending and found no evidence that such measures boosted growth. In fact, they reckon that a fiscal contraction worth 1% of GDP typically cuts output by about 0.5% after two years. To cut public debt below 60% by 2030, as the IMF advocates, America would have to endure that kind of fiscal pain every year for ten years. </p>\n<p><a name=\"ration_the_morphine\"></a><br><strong>Ration the morphine</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Fiscal tightening hurts less if offset by monetary easing. Central banks typically cut interest rates and the currency weakens when governments tighten fiscal policy. These lower interest and exchange rates roughly halve the pain of budgetary repairs, the IMF calculates.</p>\n<p>But governments cannot expect as much monetary morphine this time. If households are paying back debt, cheaper credit may provide less of a stimulus than at other times. Since so many governments are tightening at once, and not every country’s currency can cheapen against every other’s, they may not benefit from much of a depreciation. </p>\n<p>Moreover, central banks cannot cut their policy rates by as much as governments might like. Rates in America, Britain and Japan are already at or near zero. In such cases a fiscal contraction of 1% of GDP is more damaging to growth, knocking about 1% off output in the following year, according to the IMF’s researchers.</p>\n<p>This lack of leeway is a real constraint on recovery. But although central banks cannot lower their policy rates any further, they are not impotent. They can, and do, ease monetary policy in other ways. Some have tried to steer inflationary expectations with words. The Fed has promised to keep rates “exceptionally low” for an “extended period”. Several have swelled their balance-sheets by printing money to buy assets, such as government bonds, a process known as “quantitative easing”.</p>\n<p>The biggest easer, relative to the size of the economy, has been the Bank of England. Since March 2009 it has bought almost £200 billion-worth of government bonds, or gilts, equivalent to 14% of GDP, as well as a smattering of corporate bonds. The Bank’s research shows that its purchases of gilts raised their price, as well as that of other securities that compete with government paper. When prices go up, yields go down: they fell by about one percentage point on gilts and 0.7 points on the safest corporate bonds and by 1.5 points on riskier junk bonds.</p>\n<p> But it is not clear whether quantitative easing on its own changes people’s expectations of monetary policy and inflation. A more direct way to do so would be to raise the Bank’s inflation target, currently set at 2%. A figure of 4-5% might make central bankers’ lives easier, according to some economists. But most central bankers do not like the idea. They think that the costs of higher, and possibly more volatile, inflation would outweigh any gains. A less-discussed but potentially more useful innovation would be price-level targeting (PLT), meaning that a central bank targets the level of prices, not their rate of change. Targeting a price level that rises by 2% a year is different from targeting an inflation rate of 2% a year because rather than washing its hands of past mistakes, the central bank has to make up for past errors, returning prices to their prescribed path.</p>\n<p>That should make inflation expectations a more powerful stabilising force. In a slump, inflation often falls uncomfortably low: prices might rise by only 1% over the year, for example. Under PLT, the central bank has to make up this lost ground, so prices might rise faster than 2% to catch up. With a conventional inflation target, by contrast, the central bank must promise inflation no higher than 2% in each and every year, regardless of the rate the year before.</p>\n<p>In central banking, as in many industries, the most innovative outfits are often the small ones. Inflation-targeting was pioneered by New Zealand’s central bank 20 years ago before being taken up by bigger institutions such as the Bank of England. America’s Federal Reserve is still suspicious of it. Similarly, much of the best research on PLT is being conducted at the Bank of Canada. It will take time to catch on even if its theoretical appeal survives contact with reality.</p>\n<p>What seems clear is that if the economic weakness persists and inflation rates fall further, central banks may become more willing to experiment. Policies that look outré today may seem necessary tomorrow. It is worth recalling that less than two years after it began quantitative easing in March 2001 the Bank of Japan was buying equities. And in 2003 it was advised to adopt price-level targeting by none other than Ben Bernanke, now the Fed’s chairman.</p>\n<p><a name=\"beware_self-fulfilling_prophecies\"></a><br><strong>Beware self-fulfilling prophecies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some economists argue that central banks’ determination to avoid deflation could have the opposite effect. The Fed’s pledge to keep interest rates low for “an extended period”, for instance, suggests that it believes the economy will remain underemployed (and inflation subdued) for an extended period. If its pessimism spreads, it may become self-fulfilling. People will hoard cash because they expect prices to fall and investments to fail, thus prolonging the economy’s weakness.</p>\n<p>This is the “peril” that befell Japan, according to James Bullard of the St Louis Fed. The private sector came to expect deflation and its expectations were duly fulfilled. The central bank could not cut rates below zero, and it did not raise them because inflation was already too low. Mr Bullard argues that America “is closer to a Japanese-style outcome today than at any time in recent history”. </p>\n<p>Others worry not that the Fed will prolong the slump but that it may sow the seeds of the next crisis. Low rates are supposed to help the economy mobilise its resources, but they can also cause it to misallocate them. After the 2001 recession they generated “excessive growth of sectors that rely on either fixed-asset investment or credit”, argues Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago. He fears that by setting rates at zero the Fed may “merely pump up growth in the short term only to see it collapse later”. Low rates subsidise borrowers at the expense of savers. If this transfer were easier for voters to see, they might find a lot to dislike. But “because the Fed picks investors’ pockets silently and forcibly…no one asks questions about cost,” he writes.</p>\n<p>Given that the main reason for the recession and the weakness of the recovery is the dramatic increase in private thrift, this seems an odd short-term concern. The rich world is short of private borrowing and awash with saving. Overall credit has been shrinking. Nonetheless, Mr Rajan’s worries about the medium term are reasonable. Years of ultra-loose monetary policy are likely to have unwelcome side-effects. That is a reason for governments to beware of overly fast fiscal tightening. It is also a reason to look for antidotes to stagnation beyond macroeconomic policy. The longer-term remedy must be creating new jobs and increasing productivity, but the most urgent need is to hurry up the repairs to a broken financial system. </p>","rubric":"After the stimulus, the hangover","id":"17173973"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"The cost of repair","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p>ALL recessions are painful, but the hangovers that follow financial crises are particularly long and grim. Growth is substantially lower than it is during “normal” recoveries as households and firms reduce their debt burdens. That is the depressing conclusion from a growing body of research on the aftermath of big financial busts. In one such study, Prakash Kannan, an economist at the IMF, looked at 83 recessions in 21 countries since 1970. He found that in recessions that followed financial crises, growth was a lot slower and credit growth stagnated—whereas after normal recessions it soared (see chart 6).</p>\n\n<p>So far the current recovery is following this post-crisis script. Output is sluggish and credit is growing weakly or shrinking across much of the rich world. But is this because over-leveraged households and firms have become less willing to borrow, or because banks have become less willing to lend? In other words, is the credit problem one of demand or supply? The answer will make a difference to the rich world’s growth prospects and to the way policymakers should respond. People’s unwillingness to borrow bodes ill for short-term demand. Firms’ reluctance to invest also risks denting productivity growth. But a broken financial system’s inability to allocate capital efficiently has bigger long-term consequences. </p>\n<p> In practice, both supply and demand probably play a role. There is plenty of evidence that consumers and firms have become less willing to borrow. A study by Atif Mian of the University of California at Berkeley and Amir Sufi of the University of Chicago, for instance, shows a close correlation between American car sales and the level of household debt. In places where households had heavier debt burdens at the start of the recession, subsequent car sales were weaker. </p>\n      \n  <p> Across the rich world, companies, particularly big ones, have been piling up cash. Firms’ cash stockpiles are at, or near, record levels, and bond investors are clamouring for more corporate debt. In August Johnson &amp; Johnson, a top-rated American pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer-products company, issued $1.1 billion in bonds at the lowest yields then on record for ten- and 30-year corporate debt, even though its operating cash flow far exceeds its investment needs. </p>\n<p>The historical record suggests that the lack of demand for credit is likely to persist. In a recent paper Carmen and Vincent Reinhart estimate that in past crises it took an average of seven years for households and businesses to bring their debts and debt service back to tolerable levels relative to income. In many countries that process has yet to begin. In America, where progress has been fastest, the Reinharts reckon that about half the rise in the ratio of credit to GDP accumulated during the boom era has been unwound. </p>\n<p>At the same time the supply of credit is clearly constrained. Banks in the euro zone continue to tighten credit standards, and in America they have only just begun to ease standards after several years of tightening. Most worrying is the potential damage that starving companies of credit will do to productivity. </p>\n<p>Credit crunches do not affect all companies the same way. In a paper in 1996, Mr Rajan and Luigi Zingales, also of the University of Chicago, argued that the more a company depends on external financing such as bank loans or issues of stocks and bonds, rather than internal cashflow, the more sensitive its fortunes are to the health of the financial system. Mr Kannan of the IMF came to the same conclusion in his study. In the 13 recessions caused by financial crises, the industries most dependent on external finance grew 0.8 percentage points more slowly, on average, than those least dependent. There was no such gap after other kinds of recession. </p>\n<p><a name=\"cash_conundrum\"></a><br><strong>Cash conundrum</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The latest recession is likely to have similar effects. For example, Luc Laeven, an economist at the IMF, and Randy Kroszner of the University of Chicago have found that listed biotech companies, which make up 10% of America’s total stockmarket listings, are heavily dependent on external finance and their growth is likely to suffer far more from a withdrawal of credit than that of the overall economy. As Mr Laeven says, “we may only see the real impact five years from now when, without a crisis, some of those investments would have paid off and generated new products.”</p>\n\n<p> Venture-capital raising, which never fully recovered from the bursting of the internet bubble in 2000, has been “harmed immensely” by the latest crisis, says Steve Jurvetson at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, a venture-capital firm (see chart 7). Endowments, foundations and pension funds, enthusiastic participants in venture capital before the crisis, pulled back after their stock and private-equity holdings were clobbered. The moribund IPO market makes it harder for venture funds to cash in their investments. </p>\n<p>If the bear market in IPOs proves transitory (which is what usually happens), the harm will be small. A prolonged drought would be another matter. In the mid-1970s the dearth of venture capital and IPOs set back the development of computer and network technologies that would prove to have such a revolutionary impact in the 1980s and 1990s, says Josh Lerner of Harvard University. Venture-capital firms raise only about a third as much money in Europe as in America. The aftermath of the crisis could widen the gap by reinforcing continental mistrust of free-wheeling Anglo-Saxon finance.</p>\n<p>What will ultimately be more important, though, is the health of banks. Early-stage entrepreneurs are generally thought to rely on them less than on friends, family, venture capitalists and angel investors. But Alicia Robb at the University of California at Santa Cruz and David Robinson of Duke University, who examined the sources of finance of 4,000 American start-ups, found that bank loans are far more important than other sources of finance. On average, new firms borrow seven times as much from banks as they do from friends and family. </p>\n<p>Mr Robinson says the damage to start-up financing from the crisis is “potentially quite severe”. The collapse in house prices has undercut the many entrepreneurs who rely on home-equity loans. This will also depress jobs growth, which over time depends disproportionately not on either small or large firms but on small firms that become large, according to work by the Kauffman Foundation. </p>\n<p>Japan offers a sobering case history. Regulators were slow to force banks to recognise the problem of collapsed collateral values, but they did require banks to meet new international standards for capital. Banks that acknowledged non-performing loans risked falling below those standards, so they kept zombie borrowers alive on a drip-feed of fresh money. They continued to “extend credit to insolvent borrowers, gambling that somehow these firms would recover or that the government would bail them out”, according to Ricardo Caballero, Takeo Hoshi and Anil Kashyap in a 2006 paper. </p>\n<p>They estimate that zombie companies—those getting by on subsidised credit—which had made up 5-15% of banks’ borrowers in the early 1990s, increased their share to 25% later that decade. The effects were variable. Zombies were much less prevalent in manufacturing, which was constantly exposed to international competition, than in construction and retailing, where job turnover and productivity growth were lower. </p>\n<p>Policymakers have laboured to learn these lessons. In America and Europe they have imposed stress tests to see how vulnerable their banks are to bad loans. Ireland and Germany have set up “bad banks” to shift bad loans to the public sector, as Sweden and Korea successfully did after their respective crises in the 1990s. Still, there is a widespread belief that banks have not fully owned up to their problems, partly because of political pressure. Germany’s <em>Landesbanken</em>, which have ties to local politicians and firms, are widely thought to be in deeper trouble than the stress tests suggest. </p>\n<p>In America, banks and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the nationalised mortgage companies, have been discouraged by federal and state governments from foreclosing on homeowners unable to keep up their payments. Banks do not mind all that much since it allows them to put off recognising losses. But the non-performing loans may come to constitute a drain on banks’ resources that inhibits lending to more productive borrowers. </p>\n<p>In Japan bad loans were to corporations rather than households, but the problem is essentially the same. Despite their noble intent, federal subsidies that keep stressed owners in their homes delay the necessary reallocation of capital away from property. “Fortunately we’ve been pretty unsuccessful,” says Mr Jorgenson, a productivity expert at Harvard University, noting the small number of temporary mortgage modifications that have become permanent. </p>\n\n<p>Weak banks are not the only reason for a credit squeeze. There is also uncertainty over the effect of new regulations on the financial system’s ability to channel savers’ funds into investments. America recently passed its biggest overhaul of financial rules since the 1930s, known as the Dodd-Frank act after its leading congressional sponsors. On September 12th the Basel Committee of international bank regulators agreed on a new set of requirements for banks’ liquidity and capital. These rules, known as Basel 3, will require global banks to have common equity equal to at least 7% of their risk-weighted assets, against 2% now. That includes a minimum common-equity standard of 4.5% plus a countercyclical buffer of another 2.5%. </p>\n<p>Experience shows that higher capital requirements do dent credit growth, at least in the short term. The first Basel agreement on bank capital contributed significantly to a steep decline in loan growth in America in the early 1990s, according to a 2000 study by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). </p>\n<p>Bankers say the new rules will also hurt lending. The Institute of International Finance, which is backed by the world’s big banks, argued in a report published in June that the rules then being contemplated would trim annual economic growth by 0.5 percentage points in America, 0.9 in the euro area and 0.4 points in Japan over five years. But in a study of its own the BIS predicted a far more modest effect: less than 0.2 percentage points in most countries, though in the medium term there would be a gain from greater stability.</p>\n<p><a name=\"make_me_virtuous,_but_not_yet\"></a><br><strong>Make me virtuous, but not yet</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Compelling banks to set aside a lot more capital without much warning is clearly risky. The Federal Reserve found it would have to lower short-term interest rates by 40 basis points to soften the impact of bigger capital buffers on growth—an impossibility now that rates are, in effect, at zero. To deal with this concern, the new Basel rules have a long lead time. The minimum level for common equity is not due to take effect until 2015, and the additional buffer not until 2019.</p>\n<p>Equally contentious is the effect of the post-crisis regulatory clampdown on high-octane finance. America’s new financial rules compel banks to trim their holdings of private equity and hedge funds. They require greater transparency in derivatives markets and demand greater disclosure from hedge funds. These new rules are as yet imperfectly understood, but are already having an effect. For example, Ford Motor’s credit arm pulled an asset-backed bond deal because credit-rating agencies, fearful of new liabilities under the Dodd-Frank act, forbid the use of their opinions in the deal document. The deal went ahead when the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended the requirement that deal documents include such ratings. </p>\n<p>In Britain and America sophisticated finance is ingrained enough to survive tighter regulation. Continental Europe, however, has never had America’s breadth of financing options for fast-growing companies such as junk bonds, mezzanine debt and private equity, note Thomas Philippon and Nicolas Véron in a 2008 report for Bruegel, a Brussels-based think-tank. </p>\n<p>So far the European response has been less draconian than many feared. New rules currently being negotiated by the European parliament and EU finance ministers could stop foreign hedge funds and private-equity funds from marketing themselves to EU investors unless they accept certain restrictions. But Mr Véron notes that they have yet to pass, and Britain has raised objections. New proposals for regulating derivatives trading, released by the European Commission on September 15th, were less onerous than expected, and in some ways less likely to discourage innovation than America’s new rules.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, increased regulation is likely to slow the pace of financial innovation. How much that matters depends on whether such innovation boosts growth. It has become fashionable to say it does not. Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman, has caustically called the ATM cash dispenser the only worthwhile financial innovation of recent decades, a sentiment widely shared by venture capitalists and non-financial businesses. “I can’t think of any financial or banker product or service that’s ever helped us,” says Mr Jurvetson. “Engineers contribute to the economy, lawyers and bankers…subtract.”</p>\n<p>In a new book Amar Bhidé, a professor at Tufts University, argues that modern banks reduced loan decisions to arm’s-length algorithms based on credit scores and asset values, biasing them towards homogeneous loans such as residential mortgages. Yet the prospects of young, innovative businesses are not easily summarised in a credit score; a bank manager must sample its wares, kick the delivery van’s tyres and meet the founders. Mr Bhidé says that is how banks worked before deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s, and thinks a return to that old model would boost credit to young businesses.</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_uses_of_novelty\"></a><br><strong>The uses of novelty</strong>\n</p>\n<p>However, this too easily dismisses the contribution of financial innovation. Work by Mr Laeven of the IMF with Ross Levine and Stelios Michalopoulos suggests that finance innovates to meet the changing needs of the economy as it evolves; whether that innovation is beneficial depends on the economic purpose it serves. Subprime CDOs helped facilitate a reckless overinvestment in property, whereas preferred shares, a 19th-century innovation, financed that era’s railroad boom. </p>\n<p>Financial innovation may even help the economy cope with the aftermath of the crisis. Lloyds Banking Group and Rabobank have led the way in issuing “contingent convertible bonds” which can be converted to equity if the bank is about to become undercapitalised. In theory, this lessens the risk of future insolvency and taxpayer bail-out and lowers the cost of raising fresh equity capital. Private-equity firms are currently dabbling in buying deeply discounted “underwater” mortgages from banks, then restructuring the terms to prevent foreclosure. There is even a fledgling market in bonds explicitly backed by delinquent mortgages. Meanwhile, American local governments are issuing “property assessed clean energy” or PACE bonds, then lending the proceeds to homeowners to make their homes more energy-efficient. Homeowners repay the loans through their property tax. </p>\n<p>There are many more ideas on the drawing board. Robert Shiller of Yale University, whose theories led to the development of property derivatives, has proposed their use in developing home- equity insurance for homeowners. Mr Caballero and Pablo Kurlat of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would like to see governments sell “tradable insurance credits” which give any financial institution the right to buy a government guarantee in a financial crisis. </p>\n<p>Nothing may come of these ideas, yet their potential should not be dismissed. In the early 1990s America’s Resolution Trust Corporation used securitisation to offload billions of dollars in property loans inherited from busted banks more quickly and at better prices than if it had disposed of them one at a time. It would be ironic if financial innovation, so reviled for helping to bring on the latest crisis, were to play a part in cleaning up the mess. </p>","rubric":"A battered finance sector means slower growth","id":"17173933"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"From hoarding to hiring","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p>HIGH unemployment is the most visible scar left by the recession.

This link is predictable enough to qualify as an economic law, named after Arthur Okun, who showed that when America’s GDP fell by 2%, its unemployment rate rose by about half that. In this recession, however, Okun’s law did not work as expected in a number of countries. In America, New Zealand and Spain it applied with a vengeance: Spanish employment fell by twice as much as output. But in most countries its effect was mercifully mild. In Germany unemployment by the end of 2009 was lower than it had been two years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>These disparate outcomes have challenged long-held stereotypes. The German labour market has “undergone a strange mutation from a bulwark of eurosclerosis into a champion of flexibility”, writes Joachim Möller of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). America, long the poster child for efficient labour markets, suddenly looks sclerotic. Not only is it grappling with unemployment of 9.6%, but almost half of its jobless have been out of work for more than six months, the highest share since the Depression. </p>\n      \n  <p>What explains this divergence of fortunes? First, the effects of the recession were unevenly spread. In countries such as America, Spain or Ireland, the bursting of housing bubbles caused construction to slump, with the loss of many jobs that are unlikely to return soon. By contrast, in exporting countries such as Germany or Japan the damage was done mainly by the collapse of global trade, which proved more temporary. </p>\n<p>Second, labour-market rules vary widely. Some countries have long tried to trump Okun’s law with legislation of their own, making it costly or cumbersome to lay off workers. Pierre Cahuc of France’s École Polytechnique and his colleagues point to Spain’s rules on firing permanent staff, which are particularly tough, though recent reforms have eased them slightly. That has been good for those lucky enough to hold a permanent contract. But Spanish rules give little protection to temporary workers. So employers hired lots of them—they made up about 30% of all employees before the crisis—and fired them when the downturn arrived.</p>\n<p>But what made the biggest difference was companies’ response to the crisis. In most rich countries they cut hours more than bodies. German firms last year reduced working time by the equivalent of 1.4m full-time employees. And even when their staff did clock in, they worked less hard. For the first time in decades output per hour fell, reducing the input of labour by the equivalent of 1m people. </p>\n<p> The German government encouraged this labour-hoarding with its celebrated <em>Kurzarbei</em>t scheme that subsidises shorter working weeks. But this was responsible for only about a quarter of the reduction in working hours. Firms were not forced or bribed to keep their workers; they chose to do so. Before the recession industries such as metals, chemicals and machinery had found it hard to fill vacancies. Workers in these industries are highly trained and specialised and can cost up to €32,000 ($42,000) each to replace. When demand for labour falls, firms want to hang on to them, just as they might mothball an expensive piece of machinery.</p>\n<p> In America, in contrast, firms proved keener to cut workers than hours. In the 1973-75 recession, the OECD calculates, employment cuts accounted for less than a third of the reduction in man-hours. The remainder was achieved by shortening the working week or year. In the recent recession the split was reversed. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University says that American firms have come to view their employees as “disposable”. </p>\n<p>Mr Gordon’s judgment on the American labour market is one-sided. If American firms are quicker to fire their workers than their European rivals, they are also quicker to hire. Over recent decades Americans have entered unemployment at seven times the rate of Germans, but they have exited from it ten times as fast: some 58% of workers who are unemployed one month will not be the next, according to calculations by Michael Elsby of the University of Michigan, Bart Hobijn of the San Francisco Fed and Aysegül Sahin of the New York Fed. Discarded American workers have not rusted on the scrapheap, as so many do in Europe.</p>\n<p>At its best, then, the American labour market does not dispose of its workers; it recycles them. Sadly, the market is now far from its best. For every 100 people unemployed in the autumn of 2009, only 24 had escaped their predicament within a month, an historic low. The harder it is to escape joblessness, the longer people remain unemployed; and the longer they remain unemployed, the harder they find it to escape. Mr Elsby and his co-authors fear that America will be stuck with a “persistent residue of long-term unemployed workers with relatively weak search effectiveness, depressing the strength of the recovery”. Students of Europe’s stubborn unemployment in the 1980s call this “sclerosis”, an accumulation of scar tissue that makes the market more rigid.</p>\n\n<p>One obvious reason why American workers are taking longer to escape from unemployment is a lack of job openings. As long as vacancies remain low, unemployment will remain high. That is another economic relationship stable enough to carry someone’s name: the Beveridge curve, named after William Beveridge, a British economist. His curve is, however, a poor guide to the recent behaviour of America’s labour market. In 2009 a fairly steady stream of job openings did not stop unemployment rising from 7.7% to 10%. And in the first months of this year vacancies jumped, with little effect on the jobless rate (see chart 9).</p>\n<p><a name=\"keep_them_keen\"></a><br><strong>Keep them keen</strong>\n</p>\n<p> What explains this puzzle? Some economists blame the extension of unemployment benefits, which America’s jobless can now claim for 99 weeks, as long as in France. European benefits will buy you European sclerosis, argues Robert Barro, an economist at Harvard University. He reckons that the unemployment rate would be 6.8% rather than 9.5% if benefits had remained at 26 weeks. Most other economists think the effect is much smaller. </p>\n<p>Whatever the magnitude, there is bound to be some impact. The sooner the money runs out, the sooner people grab a job. The interesting question is not whether longer benefits delay re-employment, but why. Mr Barro thinks it is a case of “moral hazard”: if people are insured against a risk such as joblessness, they will try less hard to escape it. But Raj Chetty of Harvard has a subtler answer. </p>\n<p>He points out that workers who receive generous lump-sum severance payments also take longer to find a new job. The lump-sum payouts are theirs to keep whether they take another job or not, so by taking their time they are spending their own money. They may find this worth their while because by waiting for the right job they will secure higher earnings. In an ideal world the unemployed would finance their own job search by borrowing against these higher future wages. In the real world, however, benefits have to fill the gap.</p>\n<p>Some economists do not take the Beveridge curve too literally. They point out that there may be a floor below which vacancies will not fall, however dire the state of the job market. Even shrinking firms post vacancies for about 2% of their jobs, according to Steven Davis of the University of Chicago, Jason Faberman of the Philadelphia Fed and John Haltiwanger of the University of Maryland. And in the early stages of an upturn there is often a lag between vacancies rising and unemployment falling. It takes time to fill the posts the recovery opens up. Moreover, for every jobless worker who fills a vacancy, a discouraged worker may renew his job search, rejoining the labour force and adding to the official unemployment tally. So it is just a matter of time before the Beveridge curve snaps back into shape.</p>\n<p><a name=\"redrawing_the_beveridge_curve\"></a><br><strong>Redrawing the Beveridge curve</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Other economists are worried that the odd behaviour of the Beveridge curve suggests a mismatch between the skills of jobseekers and those required for new jobs. David Autor, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that the recession has reinforced trends that began 30 years ago. He reckons the American labour market has polarised, creating jobs for the well-educated and the low-paid but offering little in between. Janitors and managers weathered the recession, but white-collar sales, office and administrative jobs—the “production jobs of the information age”—fell by 8% between 2007 and 2009. The production jobs of the manufacturing age, such as craftsmen’s, repairmen’s and machine operators’, fared even worse.</p>\n<p>Even as the economy has regained (and surpassed) its former size, it has not recovered its shape. So workers fired from a sunset industry may have to break into sunrise industries to get a job. A shift in occupation may also require a change of mindset as much as skillset. “Too often the construction worker does not think of himself as a health technician,” says Larry Katz of Harvard University. </p>\n<p>The new jobs may also be in a different place. But the recession has left Americans uncharacteristically “flat-footed”, according to William Frey of the Brookings Institution. The share of people moving house from March 2007 to March 2009 was the lowest since figures were first collected in 1947. The share moving across state borders, at 1.6%, was half that in 1999-2000. </p>\n\n<p>Mr Frey puts much of the blame on the housing market. If you cannot find a buyer for your home, you cannot move to a new one. Almost one in four Americans with mortgages have “negative equity”, owing more than their house is worth. They often decide to stay put rather than default. According to Marcello Estevão and Evridiki Tsounta of the IMF, geographic immobility and skill mismatches reinforce each other. As a result, they say, America’s underlying, or “structural”, rate of unemployment rose from 5% before the financial crisis to between 6% and 6.75% in 2009. So even if the recovery gathers steam, almost one-third of the rise in joblessness may endure.</p>\n<p>Few policymakers think that America’s jobless problem is mainly structural. An exception is Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, who reckons that “most” of it is. And Edmund Phelps, a Nobel prize-winning economist at Columbia University, worries that the focus on deficient demand “lulls us into failing to ‘think structural’ in dealing with long-term problems”. The economy is not like a skater who just needs help to get up after a fall, he wrote recently in the <em>New York Times</em>. “Our skater has broken some bones and needs real attention.”</p>\n<p>What kind of attention? Among a long list of proposals, he advocates tax credits for companies employing low-paid workers. In January Mr Obama proposed a $5,000 credit for firms that hired people in 2010. As a flat sum, the credit would have represented a bigger subsidy to low-paid workers. But scepticism about a stimulus forced him to scale the tax break back to $1,000 for hiring people who had been unemployed for 60 days or more. That may be a pity. According to a study by Ms Sahin and two colleagues, the $1,000 credit could cut the unemployment rate by almost one percentage point. But a $5,000 credit might have cut it by over three points, at least in the short run. </p>\n<p> Hiring incentives might tempt employers, but they will not help if workers have the wrong skills or are stuck in the wrong part of the country. That is why the IMF’s economists also advocate an overhaul of federal training programmes and more effort to deal with negative equity, for instance by changing America’s bankruptcy law to allow judges to restructure mortgage debt. America spends only 0.17% of GDP on active labour-market policies, such as training and job search, far less than the OECD average. Such schemes as it has are fragmented and not particularly effective. That may need to change. Having long taken their labour market’s flexibility for granted, Americans may now have to work at it.</p>\n<p>Even as Americans are beginning to fear that their labour market is turning European, Europeans still feel under pressure to turn Anglo-Saxon. The American labour market may be less dynamic than it was, but it is still more dynamic than Europe’s. America’s exit rate from unemployment, at 24% a month, is still far faster than rates in recent decades in France (8%), Germany (6%) and Italy (4%). And although long-term unemployment in America has risen markedly (at the end of 2009 2.2% of workers had been out of a job for more than a year, compared with 0.5% before the recession), a bigger proportion of workers in Germany, France and Italy has been jobless for more than a year. </p>\n\n<p>Many European countries fail to make the most of their working-age population, even as that population is poised to shrink. In Germany it has already contracted by 2.2% over the past decade. Countries with an unfavourable demography grow more slowly not only because fewer people work but also because they save and invest less. From 1990 to 2008 the combined GDP of the EU-15 (the 15 members of the EU prior to its 2004 enlargement) grew by about 2% a year on average. Thanks to a less favourable demography it can expect to grow only 1.6% a year over the next two decades, other things equal, according to the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). </p>\n<p> Governments are not entirely powerless to deal with the effects of demographic trends. They can raise the retirement age, open the doors to immigration and tempt more people into the labour force. Japan, for instance, is greying faster than Europe, but its employment rates are better than America’s. In Denmark the working-age population is already shrinking, but a larger proportion of this smaller population is actually working. </p>\n<p>Indeed, a number of European countries have changed far more than many (especially Americans) give them credit for. In a forthcoming report the MGI heralds the “unsung” progress in European labour markets. Despite a far smaller growth in their population, the 15 west European member states of the EU created more jobs than America between 1995 and 2008. They countered their adverse demography by reducing their jobless rates and boosting participation in the labour market. For example, the share of working-age women in the labour force rose by 11 percentage points between 1990 and 2010. </p>\n<p>The EU-15 still get less work out of their population than America does (733 hours per person per year against America’s 913). But the gap is closing. To narrow it further, Europe does not necessarily have to become like America. It could greatly improve its performance simply by adopting its own continent’s best practice everywhere. Some progress along those lines is being made. Greece is overhauling its labour rules; Spain has just passed a modest reform (see <a href=\"/node/17173947\">article</a>). But there is much more to be done.</p>\n<p><a name=\"taking_up_the_slack\"></a><br><strong>Taking up the slack</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In Sweden 88% of women aged between 25 and 54 take part in the labour market. It helps that the country’s extensive day-care facilities for children are largely reserved for workers, and that couples file their tax returns separately so that households do not get hit by higher marginal tax rates on their second incomes. </p>\n<p>A larger share of Sweden’s older people, too, remain in the labour force than anywhere else on the continent, not least because they accrue higher retirement benefits for each year they work after the age of 61. If other Europeans aged between 55 and 64 were as industrious as older Swedes, the continent could reduce the gap in hours with America by almost a quarter, according to the MGI. </p>\n<p>The rest of Europe could also learn from Denmark’s efforts to beat unemployment and from the Netherlands’ success in getting youngsters into work. To echo an old joke, heaven is where women and older people work like the Swedes, the young work like the Dutch and the unemployed find jobs like the Danes. Hell is where workers get into unemployment like the Americans and out of it like the Italians. </p>","rubric":"Some countries have successfully preserved jobs. Now they must create new ones","id":"17173957"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"Pass and move","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p>WHEN Spain won the World Cup in July, it confirmed its reputation for fluid and efficient football. If only its economy worked as well. GDP growth is sluggish and a fifth of the workforce is unemployed. Two features of Spain’s jobs market share much of the blame: the high cost of firing permanent workers, and a wage system that binds firms to industry-wide pay deals. On June 16th, the day Spain played its first World Cup match, the government set out its plans to cure these ills. The reform bill, passed by parliament on September 9th, falls well short of what was needed but may nevertheless do some good.</p>\n<p>Changes were long overdue. Because it is so costly to lay off workers, businesses are reluctant to hire them in the first place. A 1994 measure to promote jobs made it easier to hire temporary workers and led to a sharp rise in their numbers. But only a small proportion of them move on to “protected” jobs. Most are laid off at the end of their contract. The high churn among temporary workers, most of them young, female or migrant, means firms have little incentive to train them. </p>\n\n<p>This has pushed many into low-skilled work. The impact on Spain’s productivity is compounded by rigid wage rules. Last year nominal pay rose by 3% despite the weak economy. Firms have to pay the rates that are negotiated centrally between unions and employer groups, rather than tailor pay to prevailing business conditions. That costs jobs and hurts efficiency. Firms cannot undercut rivals on wages, which limits their ability to grow. Research by Rafael Doménech, at BBVA, a Madrid-based bank, shows that Spanish firms are less productive than American ones partly because they tend to be small.</p>\n      \n  <p>Ideally the rules would allow wage bargaining to take place locally and promote a good balance between job flexibility and security for all workers. A group of 100 Spanish economists had pushed for a “single contract”, with employment rights that rise gradually with tenure. That would make it cheap and easy to get rid of recent recruits that turn out to be flops (which is an appealing feature of temporary contracts), but firms would also have an incentive to invest in the workers they hold on to.</p>\n<p>The reforms fall short of that. A change in the main contract for new permanent workers lowers severance pay from 45 to 33 days’ wages for each year worked. (Existing workers are unaffected.) This could fall to 20 days’ pay for all workers at firms that can show they face large and persistent losses. Spain’s complex wage-bargaining system remains intact but firms can now opt out if their employees agree. </p>\n<p>How effective these new rules will be depends on how they are interpreted. “It could take years to clarify under what circumstances firms can fire workers and pay only 20 days’ compensation,” says Luis Garicano, of the London School of Economics. In the past, Spain’s labour courts have taken a dim view of firms seeking to cut jobs. Firms may find it tricky to persuade workers to accept lower wages than mandated by national pay deals. Spain’s jobless benefits are quite generous and are paid for long periods, so many workers may opt for redundancy rather than take a pay cut. </p>\n<p>A lot also depends on how actively the government promotes the reforms. A big worry is that the labour ministry seems just as attached to the status quo as labour unions and business groups are. And even if officials support the changes, few economists expect Spain’s jobless rate to plummet. But a fall in the share of temporary employees in the workforce, and weaker wage growth in response to high unemployment, would be promising signs that the reforms are working. </p>\n<p>Since only a year ago the possibility of any reform at all seemed remote, even such mild progress has been greeted with relief. “This takes Spain from worst to better,” says Angel Ubide, at Tudor Investment Corporation. But it may not catch up with its football team for a while. </p>","rubric":"Spain offers a test case for labour-market reform in Europe","id":"17173947"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"Smart work","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p>PRODUCTIVITY growth is the closest economics gets to a magic elixir, especially for ageing advanced economies. When workers produce more for every hour they toil, living standards rise and governments have more resources to service their debts and support those who cannot work. As the rich world emerges from the financial crisis, faster productivity growth could counteract the drag from adverse demography. But slower productivity growth could make matters worse.</p>\n<p> Workers’ productivity depends on their skills, the amount of capital invested in helping them to do their jobs and the pace of “innovation”—the process of generating ideas that lead to new products and more efficient business practices. Financial crises and deep recessions can affect these variables in several ways. As this special report has argued, workers’ skills may erode if long-term unemployment rises. The disruption to the financial sector and the reluctance of businesses to invest in the face of uncertain demand may also reduce the rate of capital formation, delaying the factory upgrades and IT purchases that would boost workers’ efficiency. </p>\n<p>Financial crises can affect the pace of innovation, too, though it is hard to predict which way. Deep recessions can slow it down as firms slash their spending on research and development. But they can also boost the pace of efficiency gains as weak demand forces firms to rethink their products and cost structures and the weakest companies are winnowed out. According to Alexander Field of Santa Clara University, the 1930s saw the fastest efficiency improvements in America’s history amid large-scale restructuring.</p>\n      \n  <p><a name=\"here_we_go_again\"></a><br><strong>Here we go again</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Almost every government in the rich world has a spanking new “innovation strategy”. Industrial policy—out of fashion since its most credible champion, Japan, lost its way in the 1990s—is staging a comeback. But mostly such policies end up subsidising well-connected industries and products. “Green technology” is a favourite receptacle for such subsidies. </p>\n<p>In 2008 France created a sovereign-wealth fund as part of its response to the financial crisis; it promises to promote biotechnology ventures, though it has also sunk capital into conventional manufacturers that happened to need money. In 2009 Britain followed suit with a “strategic investment fund”. The Japanese too are back in the game. In June the newly invigorated Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) unveiled a plan to promote five strategic sectors, ranging from environmental products to robotics. However, past experiments with industrial policy, from France’s Minitel, an attempt to create a government-run national communications network, to Spain’s expensive subsidies to jump-start solar power, suggest that governments are not much good at picking promising sectors or products. </p>\n<p>More important, the politicians’ current focus on fostering productivity growth via exciting high-tech breakthroughs misses a big part of what really drives innovation: the diffusion of better business processes and management methods. This sort of innovation is generally the result of competitive pressure. The best thing that governments can do to foster new ideas is to get out of the way. This is especially true in the most regulated and least competitive parts of the economy, notably services.</p>\n<p> To see why competition matters so much, consider the recent history of productivity in the rich world. On the eve of the recession the rate of growth in workers’ output per hour was slowing. So, too, was the pace of improvement in “total factor productivity” (a measure of the overall efficiency with which capital and workers are used which is economists’ best gauge of the speed of innovation). But that broad trend masks considerable differences. </p>\n\n<p> Over the past 15 years America’s underlying productivity growth—adjusted for the ups and downs of the business cycle—has outperformed most other rich economies’ by a wide margin (see chart 12). Workers’ output per hour soared in the late 1990s, thanks largely to investment in computers and software. At first this advance was powered by productivity gains within the technology sector. From 2000 onwards efficiency gains spread through the wider economy, especially in services such as retailing and wholesaling, helped by the deregulated and competitive nature of America’s economy. The improvements were extraordinary, though they slowed after the middle of the decade.</p>\n\n<p>The recent history of productivity in Europe is almost the mirror image of America’s. Up to the mid-1990s the continent’s output per hour grew faster than America’s (see chart 13), helped by imports of tried and tested ideas from across the water. Thanks to this process of catch-up, by 1995 Europe’s output per hour reached over 90% of the American level. But then Europe slowed, and by 2008 the figure was back down to 83%. This partly reflected Europe’s labour-market reforms, which brought more low-skilled workers into the workforce. That seemed a price well worth paying for higher employment. But the main reason for Europe’s disappointing productivity performance was that it failed to squeeze productivity gains from its service sector. </p>\n<p>A forthcoming history of European growth by Marcel Timmer and Robert Inklaar of the University of Groningen, Mary O’Mahony of Birmingham University and Bart Van Ark of the Conference Board, a business-research organisation, carefully dissects the statistics for individual countries and industries and finds considerable variation within Europe. Finland and Sweden improved their productivity growth whereas Italy and Spain were particularly sluggish. Europe also did better in some sectors than in others; for example, telecommunications was a bright spot. But overall, compared with America, European firms invested relatively little in services and innovative business practices. A new McKinsey study suggests that around two-thirds of the differential in productivity growth between America and Europe between 1995 and 2005 can be explained by the gap in “local services”, such as retail and wholesale services. </p>\n<p>Europe’s service markets are smaller than America’s, fragmented along national lines and heavily regulated. The OECD has tracked regulation of product and services markets across countries since 1998. It measures the degree of state control, barriers to competition and obstacles to starting a new company, assigning a score to each market of between 0 and 6 (where 0 is the least restrictive). Overall the absolute level of product regulation fell between 1998 and 2008, and the variation between countries lessened. America and Britain score joint best, with 0.84. The EU average is 1.4. But when it comes to services, the variation is larger and Europe has made much less progress. </p>\n<p>In professional services, the OECD’s score for Europe is fully twice as high as for America (meaning it is twice as restrictive). As the McKinsey report notes, many European countries are rife with anti-competitive rules. Architects’ and lawyers’ fees in Italy and Germany are subject to price floors and ceilings. Notaries in France, Spain and Greece and pharmacies in Greece are banned from advertising their services. Such restrictions limit the ability of efficient newcomers to compete for market share, cosseting incumbents and raising costs across the economy. </p>\n<p>In Japan productivity growth slumped after the country’s asset bubble burst at the start of the 1990s. One reason, as an earlier section of this report has described, was the failure to deal decisively with the bad loans clogging its banks, which propped up inefficient “zombie” companies rather than forcing them into liquidation. That meant less capital was available to lend to upstart firms. Another problem was the lack of competition. Japan’s service sector, unlike its world-class manufacturers, is fragmented, protected from foreign competition and heavily regulated, so it failed to capture the gains of the IT revolution. </p>\n<p>Over the years Japan made various efforts at regulatory reform, from freeing up the energy market and mobile telephony in the mid-1990s to liberalising the financial sector in the late 1990s. These have borne some fruit. Japan’s total factor productivity growth, unlike Europe’s, began to improve after 2000. But coupled with the continuing weakness of investment, the reforms were too modest to bring about a decisive change in the country’s overall productivity prospects. </p>\n<p><a name=\"learn_swedish\"></a><br><strong>Learn Swedish</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sweden offers a more encouraging lesson. In the aftermath of its banking bust in the early 1990s it not only cleaned up its banks quickly but also embarked on a radical programme of microeconomic deregulation. The government reformed its tax and pension systems and freed up whole swaths of the economy, from aviation, telecommunications and electricity to banking and retailing. Thanks to these reforms, Swedish productivity growth, which had averaged 1.2% a year from 1980 to 1990, accelerated to a remarkable 2.2% a year from 1991 to 1998 and 2.5% from 1999 to 2005, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.</p>\n<p> Sweden’s retailers put in a particularly impressive performance. In 1990, McKinsey found, they were 5% less productive than America’s, mainly because a thicket of regulations ensured that stores were much smaller and competition less intense. Local laws restricted access to land for large stores, existing retailers colluded on prices and incumbent chains pressed suppliers to boycott cheaper competitors. But in 1992 the laws were changed to weaken municipal land-use restrictions, and Swedish entry into the EU and the creation of a new competition authority raised competitive pressures. Large stores and vertically integrated chains rapidly gained market share. By 2005 Sweden’s retail productivity was 14% higher than America’s.</p>\n<p>The restructuring of retail banking services was another success story. Consolidation driven by the financial crisis and by EU entry increased competition. New niche players introduced innovative products like telephone and internet banking that later spread to larger banks. Many branches were closed, and by 2006 Sweden had one of the lowest branch densities in Europe. Between 1995 and 2002 banking productivity grew by 4.6% a year, much faster than in other European countries. Swedish banks’ productivity went from slightly behind to slightly ahead of American levels.</p>\n<p>All this suggests that for many rich countries the quickest route to faster productivity growth will be to use the crisis to deregulate the service sector. A recent study by the Bank of France and the OECD looked at 20 sectors in 15 OECD countries between 1984 and 2007. It found that reducing regulation on “upstream” services would have a marked effect not just on productivity in those sectors but also on other parts of the economy. The logic is simple: more efficient lawyers, distributors or banks enable firms across the economy to become more productive. The size of the potential gains calculated by the Bank of France is stunning. Getting rid of all price, market-entry and other competition-restricting regulations would boost annual total factor productivity growth by one percentage point in a typical country in their sample, enough to more than double its pace.</p>\n<p>Getting rid of all anti-competitive regulation may be impossible, but even the more modest goal of embracing “best practice” would yield large benefits. The IMF has calculated that if countries could reduce regulation to the average of the least restrictive three OECD countries, annual productivity growth would rise by some 0.2 percentage points in America, 0.3 percentage points in the euro area and 0.6 percentage points in Japan. The larger gains for Europe and Japan reflect the amount of deregulation left to be done. In both cases the productivity gains to be achieved from moving to best practice would all but counter the drag on growth from unfavourable demography.</p>\n\n<p> Even in America there would be benefits. But, alas, the regulatory pendulum is moving in the opposite direction as the Obama administration pushes through new rules on industries from health care to finance. So far the damage may be limited. Many of Mr Obama’s regulatory changes, from tougher fuel-efficiency requirements to curbs on deep-water drilling, were meant to benefit consumers and the environment, not to curb competition and protect incumbents. Some of the White House’s ideas, such as the overhaul of broadband internet access, would in fact increase competition. The biggest risk lies in finance, where America’s new rules could easily hold back innovation.</p>\n<p><a name=\"an_unlikely_role_model\"></a><br><strong>An unlikely role model</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The country that is grasping the challenge of deregulation most energetically is Greece, whose debt crisis has earned it a reputation for macroeconomic mismanagement. Under pressure from the IMF and its European partners, the Greek government has embarked on one of the most radical reforms in modern history to boost its productive potential. </p>\n<p>Again, this involves freeing up an historically cushioned service sector. So far the main battleground has been trucking. Before Greece descended into crisis, its lorry drivers required special licences, and none had been granted for several decades. So a licence changed hands in the secondary market for about €300,000, driving up the costs of everything that travelled by road in Greece. But under a reform recently passed by the Greek government, the number of licences is due to double. Greek lorry drivers went on strike in protest, but the government did not budge. Lawyers and pharmacists too are slated for deregulation. </p>\n<p>If Greece can stick to its plans, it will, like Sweden, show that crises can offer valuable opportunities. Without the country’s brush with default and the conditions attached to the resulting bail-out, its leaders would have been unlikely to muster the necessary political will. </p>\n<p>The sluggish progress of reform elsewhere underlines this point. Germany, which ranks 25th out of 30 OECD countries on the complications of its licence and permit system, approaches deregulation on tiptoes: it recently reduced restrictions on price-setting by architects and allowed chimney-sweeps easier market access. </p>\n<p>Two French economists, Jacques Delpla and Charles Wyplosz, have argued that incumbent service providers should be paid off in exchange for accepting competition. They reckon that compensating French taxi drivers for deregulation would cost €4.5 billion. But buying off the losers from reforms may not hold much appeal. </p>\n<p>Boosting European integration could be another way to cut through national resistance to deregulation. As Mario Monti, a former EU competition commissioner, pointed out in a recent call for action, 70% of the EU’s GDP is in services but only 20% of those services cross borders. The EU’s Services Directive, which is supposed to boost cross-country competition in services, has proved fairly toothless. </p>\n<p><a name=\"how_governments_can_help\"></a><br><strong>How governments can help</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Activism on the part of governments is not always misguided. Their investment in basic research is important. The grants doled out by America’s National Institutes of Health, for example, generate the raw ideas that pharmaceutical firms turn into profitable medicines. America’s Defence Department created the beginnings of the internet. Public spending on building and maintaining infrastructure also matters, though economists argue about how much. Governments can encourage private R&amp;D spending with tax credits and subsidies, and the evidence suggests that more R&amp;D spending overall boosts growth. Other research shows that firms which spend more on R&amp;D are also often quicker to adopt other innovations.</p>\n<p>But these traditional ways of encouraging innovation may be less relevant now that research has become more global and more concentrated on software than on hardware. Since the mid-1990s China alone has accounted for a third of the increase in global spending on research and development. Big firms maintain research facilities in many countries. Dreaming up new products and services, as well as better ways of producing old ones, increasingly involves collaboration across borders and companies. As Mr Jorgenson of Harvard University puts it: “Think Google, not lab coats.”</p>\n<p>In this more fluid world the old kind of government incentives, such as tax credits and subsidies, may do less to boost innovation than more imaginative inducements, such as offering firms prizes for breakthrough innovations. Bigger efforts to remove remaining barriers to collaboration, from limitations on high-skilled immigration to excessively rigid land-use rules, should also help. </p>\n<p>A smart innovation agenda, in short, would be quite different from the one that most rich governments seem to favour. It would be more about freeing markets and less about picking winners; more about creating the right conditions for bright ideas to emerge and less about promises of things like green jobs. But pursuing that kind of policy requires courage and vision—and most of the rich economies are not displaying enough of either. </p>","rubric":"Faster productivity growth will be an important part of rich economies’ revival","id":"17173903"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"A better way","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p>“ONCE you start thinking about growth”, said Robert Lucas, a Nobel prize-winning economist, “it’s hard to think about anything else.” Judging by their rhetoric, the world’s policymakers are indeed thinking about little else. The statement released after the most recent meeting of G20 leaders in Toronto in June mentioned the word “growth” 29 times in nine pages. Mr Obama says his economic policy is all about “laying the foundations for long-term growth”. Britain’s prime minister, David Cameron, used his first speech in office to lay out a “strategy for economic growth”. Japan’s government unveiled a ten-year “new growth strategy” in June. </p>\n<p> The task is immense. The rich world’s nascent recoveries are losing momentum even though joblessness remains worryingly high. The slowdown has been most obvious in America, where GDP growth shrank to a paltry 1.6% annual rate in the second quarter and appears to have remained stuck at much the same level over the summer. The housing market has turned down again and the pace of job creation remains painfully slow. </p>\n<p> Led by a surge in German GDP, the euro area fared relatively better in the first half of this year, but as the rebound in global trade wanes, Germany’s export-dependent economy is slowing again. The country’s latest figures for investor confidence look a lot feebler than they did earlier this year. Japan’s economy, too, is weakening for much the same reason. </p>\n\n      \n  <p> The OECD’s September forecast reckons that the annual rate of GDP growth in the G7 group of big rich economies will fall to 1.5% in the second half of this year, a full percentage point below its forecast in May. Gloomier analysts worry about a “double-dip” recession. Even optimists no longer expect anything more than tepid growth in 2011 (see chart 15).</p>\n<p> Looking further ahead, towards the middle of this decade, the picture remains dark as first debt and then ageing populations will weigh heavily on the rich world’s prospects. The fall-out of the financial bust will weigh on private spending for several more years as banking systems are repaired and households and firms pay down their debts. Even in America, where households are moving out of the red faster than elsewhere, they have at best got only halfway there. </p>\n<p> According to the analysis by Carmen and Vincent Reinhart mentioned earlier in this report, GDP per head, on average, grows 1% a year more slowly in the decade after big crises than in the decade before. Since rich economies as a group grew by an average of 2.5% a year before the financial crisis and then slumped by more than 3% during the recession, that suggests they might grow by less than 1.7% a year over the next few years. </p>\n<p> Slower growth in advanced economies will mean lower private investment, higher unemployment and higher public debt, all of which will hurt their longer-term capacity to grow. At the same time the adverse effect of ageing (and in many cases shrinking) populations on growth will become much more noticeable, especially in Europe, where a big rise in the share of women in the labour force has hitherto concealed the demographic drag. </p>\n<p>The overall effect of these various elements is likely to be big. The grimmest predictions of the consequences of demography, higher public debt and lower private investment suggest that the potential growth rate of the big advanced economies as a group could halve, from above 2% before the crisis to around 1% over the next few years. Small wonder that Mr Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank and a man not normally given to hyperbole, worries that the next ten years could be a “lost decade”. </p>\n<p> Are today’s growth strategies good enough to prove him wrong? There are three big reasons to doubt it. First, rich countries, collectively, are relying too much on foreign demand as a source of growth. Second, they are at risk of both overdoing and mismanaging short-term fiscal austerity. Third, most are paying far too little attention to structural reforms that would speed up the pace of debt reduction, make high unemployment less likely to become entrenched and boost productivity growth.</p>\n<p> Begin with the wishful thinking on foreign demand. At every international economic gathering there is talk of the importance of “rebalancing” the pattern of global demand. The world economy must rely less on spending by over-indebted Anglo-Saxon consumers and cajole more spending out of thriftier Germans and Japanese, as well as firms and households in fast-growing emerging economies, notably China. Yet there is little sign that these efforts have done any good so far. </p>\n<p> The rich world’s deficit countries, such as America and Britain, certainly want to push exports to counter weak consumer demand. The Obama administration has said it would like to double America’s exports in five years. Britain’s new government has put export promotion at the heart of its foreign policy. But the surplus economies, particularly Germany and Japan, are equally determined to go on focusing on trade. Japan recently intervened in currency markets for the first time in six years to stem the yen’s rise. </p>\n<p> Nor is there much sign of a rapid rebalancing towards the emerging world. China, as the biggest saver, should bear the brunt of such a shift. Its current-account surplus declined sharply between 2008 and 2009, but this year it is rising again. Although the government promised a more flexible currency in June, the yuan has barely moved in recent months. </p>\n<p>More important, the structural barriers that get in the way of higher domestic spending—from government monopolies in many services to taxes, subsidies and corporate-governance rules that favour profits over wages—will take years to remove. Nor is there much sign that other emerging economies are keen to run big deficits for now. In the longer term faster growth in poorer countries’ demand is bound to be good for the advanced economies, but it will take time.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a_dangerous_squeeze\"></a><br><strong>A dangerous squeeze</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The rich countries also seem to underestimate the risks that fiscal austerity poses to domestic demand. Virtually all the advanced economies are planning some combination of tax increases and spending cuts next year as their stimulus packages expire and budget consolidation begins. Collectively, says the IMF, these will amount to a tightening of some 1.25% of GDP. That would be the biggest simultaneous fiscal squeeze since modern records began. The IMF’s own recent analyses, which refute the idea that fiscal contractions boost growth in the short term, suggest that such a tightening might reduce the rich world’s already weak growth next year by a percentage point or so. </p>\n<p> Is this a sensible trade-off? Countries in which financial markets have lost confidence, such as Ireland or Spain, have no choice. Others must weigh the costs of slower growth against the benefits of greater prudence, particularly the reduced risk of a sudden jump in bond yields and the prospect of lower public debt later. For many individual economies, particularly open and indebted ones, that points towards earlier austerity. But what makes sense for individual countries may not make sense for the rich world as a whole.</p>\n<p> More important, policymakers’ obsession with cutting deficits in the short term has deflected attention from the more important question of how to do it. Some countries are setting about it the right way. France, for instance, is pushing through pension reform; and in Britain three-quarters of the fiscal adjustment will come from spending cuts. But America, if Mr Obama has his way and the Bush tax cuts for high earners are eliminated, is heading for the worst possible outcome: raising taxes on income and capital but failing to trim the country’s pension liabilities and rising health-care costs. </p>\n<p> In most rich countries the detailed plans for fiscal austerity contrast sharply with a lamentable lack of microeconomic ambition. Greece is the only rich economy that is responding to the crisis with broad and radical reforms to boost its productive potential. In Britain, whose economy is already relatively deregulated, spending cuts will help reduce the role of the state. But elsewhere progress has been limited. Spain has gone some way towards freeing its labour markets, and Japan’s “growth strategy” proposes a series of small liberalising steps, such as cutting rules around nursing care. But Germany’s politicians are far keener to denounce deficits than to deregulate domestic services. And in America the policy debate revolves almost entirely around demand, the wisdom of stimulus and the Bush tax cuts. Most officials barely acknowledge that supply-side reforms, such as an overhaul of training schemes to help combat long-term joblessness, or bigger efforts to reduce household debts, might even be necessary. </p>\n<p> The economic case for a growth strategy that combines hefty fiscal cuts with timid structural reforms is not obvious, especially when private demand is likely to stay weak. In the long run bold productivity-enhancing reforms will do more to boost the rich world’s growth prospects than short-term fiscal austerity. And better growth prospects will, themselves, make government debt less onerous. In a recent study, economists at the IMF analysed the respective impact of deficit reduction, global rebalancing and productivity-enhancing structural reforms on the growth prospects of big rich economies and found that by far the strongest positive effect came from structural reforms. </p>\n<p> There is also a political logic to favouring a bigger prop for demand along with bolder action on structural reforms. The contrasting stories of Sweden and Japan suggest that although big crises can offer an opportunity to overhaul an entire economy, a prolonged period of sluggish growth makes structural reforms increasingly difficult. Both politicians and voters become accustomed to gradual decline. In many rich countries an extended bout of high unemployment could easily lead to policies such as protectionism that will further hurt long-term growth.</p>\n<p> All told, there is a case for changing the debate about growth in the rich world. Fiscal consolidation should be more nuanced and supply-side reforms should be given greater prominence. This is particularly true for America. In an ideal world, America’s politicians would come up with a package of medium-term spending cuts and tax reforms to fill the country’s fiscal gap. But since that is impossible, given that Republicans refuse to countenance any tax increases and Democrats refuse to cut any spending on entitlements, the best short-term remedy would be to extend the Bush tax cuts for another three years. </p>\n<p>America’s structural reforms ought to focus on encouraging households to reduce their debts more quickly and tackling entrenched joblessness. By the standards of previous financial crises America’s banks have been recapitalised remarkably quickly, but much less has been done to deal with the $800 billion-worth of American mortgages (almost 25% of the total) where the house is worth less than the outstanding loan. Legal reforms that made it easier to reduce this debt overhang would allow a more efficient allocation of capital and hence boost investment. They would help to deal with high unemployment, too, by making it easier for workers to move to new jobs. A comprehensive strategy to counter structural joblessness would also include things like hiring subsidies for the hard-to-employ and an overhaul of training schemes. </p>\n\n<p> Outside America the design of fiscal consolidation is more sensible, though the scale may be excessive. In both continental Europe and Japan reform should concentrate on boosting growth by freeing up labour markets and services. Rules that stifle competition should be struck out in industries from health care to road transport. </p>\n<p> The to-do list is familiar, not least because the OECD has spent years cataloguing and comparing the rich world’s supply-side rigidities. It even produces a handy annual publication, called “Going for Growth”, that sets out priorities. But rich-world governments have found it hard to summon up the political courage to act. The recession and its grim aftermath offer an opportunity to do better. </p>\n<p>If the rich world really wants to go for growth, it must get away from its narrow focus on public debt and embark on a broader economic overhaul. Instead of promising to halve their budget deficits by 2013, for instance, big rich economies could decide to raise their retirement ages or free up their professional services. Fiscal consolidation would not be ignored: it would just not be the only priority. </p>\n<p>An American official famously quipped after the 2007-08 debacle that you should “never let a serious crisis go to waste”. It is advice that the rich world would do well to heed. </p>","rubric":"The rich world should worry about growth-promoting reforms more than short-term fiscal austerity","id":"17173919"},{"section":"Special reports","headline":"Sources and acknowledgments","title":"A special report on the world economy","content":"<p><a name=\"\"></a><br><strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many people helped in the preparation of this report.

They come in three flavours. Pure electric vehicles like Nissan’s Leaf can be driven for 150km or so before they need to be recharged for six to eight hours. Range-extenders like GM’s Volt (the Ampera in Europe) are powered by an electric motor that can be recharged either from the mains or by an on-board internal-combustion engine. Then there are familiar hybrids like the Toyota Prius, now being adapted to take a charging cord and with a longer electric-only range. </p>\n\n<p>Mitsubishi was one of the first away, launching its electric i-MiEV in Japan in April. Production of European models began on October 6th, including versions for France’s PSA group, which will sell the cars as a Peugeot iOn or Citroën C-ZERO. But GM and the Renault-Nissan alliance are making the biggest push into the mass market. The latter will launch four Nissan and four Renault electric models in the next two years. Carlos Ghosn, head of Renault-Nissan, believes that by 2020 one in ten new cars in Europe will be electric, while hybrids, such as the Prius, will have a similar share of the market. </p>\n  <p>Governments are solidly behind the new vehicles, which they see as essential for bringing down carbon-dioxide emissions and reducing pollution in cities. The Volt was one of the reasons why the White House propped up GM in 2009 when the carmaker entered bankruptcy. Dan Akerson, GM’s new chief executive, says the company is committed to electrification and has other electric cars under development. Generous government subsidies are on offer: American buyers will be able to obtain up to $7,500 towards the purchase of an electric car. </p>\n<p>Mr Ghosn reckons incentives will be needed for another four years or so. He thinks electric cars will compete without subsidies against conventional cars only when production reaches about 500,000 per model. It is far from sure that cash-strapped governments will keep their wallets open that long. And other questions loom over the new electric cars. </p>\n<p>The big one is “range anxiety”. Drivers are not used to thinking precisely about how far they will drive before returning home. Electric cars (at least the ones without petrol engines to top up the battery) demand that they do. And some tests have suggested that manufacturers’ claims about the ranges of their vehicles are optimistic. A car that is full of passengers and running the heating or air-conditioning will drain the battery more quickly. Yet the manufacturers believe these concerns can be overcome. </p>\n<p> So far, BMW has carried out the biggest test of electric motoring. It leased 600 electric Mini Es to drivers in Britain, Germany and the United States. Before getting their cars most drivers said they expected the 150km range to be restrictive. But the driving patterns of Mini E users in Berlin turned out to differ only slightly from those in ordinary Minis. Even in California, land of freeways and long commutes, Mini E drivers clocked up 48km a day, not far behind the American average of 64km. Most Mini E users recharged their cars at home, and some did so only two or three times a week rather than every night. BMW concludes from these tests that electric cars are suitable for most people and that range anxiety fades as drivers get used to them. </p>\n<p>Another study, by Deloitte, a consultancy, found that three-quarters of Americans would not consider buying an electric car unless it had a range of 300 miles. But the carmakers do not have to convince everyone at the outset. In Deloitte’s survey, those who were inclined to buy tended to be early adopters of new technologies. They were typically young with a much higher-than-average household income. They were living in an urban or suburban area—commonly southern California—and had a garage with electrical power where they could recharge the car. Such drivers would probably treat electric vehicles as second cars, and prize them for their green show-off value. Mr Ghosn sees electric drive as “a complementary technology”.</p>\n<p>A further problem, which government subsidies have not entirely eliminated, is “sticker shock”. Electric cars are expensive. BMW reckons they will be a premium product, which is why it plans to launch a light electric citycar with a fancy composite body in 2013. Renault is trying to hold down prices by separating the cost of the battery from its new electric car, the Fluence. In Britain the car will cost around £18,000 ($28,660) after a £5,000 government subsidy—about the same as a diesel-powered equivalent. Buyers will lease the battery for about £80 a month. Renault believes drivers who are used to paying regularly for fuel will tolerate this charge. Leasing the battery should also alleviate concerns about its reliability. GM is responding to the same concern by guaranteeing the battery in its Volt for eight years or 100,000 miles.</p>\n<p>One issue that is important to many buyers is how the value of electric cars will hold up in the second-hand market. The answer will not become clear for several years. Some in the industry think that a shortage of cars could drive up prices, at least at first. But they could plummet if the batteries cause problems or users find the range of the vehicles too limiting.</p>\n<p>Electric cars are evolving quickly. Although he refuses to reveal figures, Mr Ghosn says the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of battery capacity for Renault-Nissan cars has fallen by half in four years. Earlier this year Boston Consulting Group estimated that electric cars will not be fully competitive until costs fall to about $200 per kwh. That would substantially reduce the cost of the 24 kwh battery used by the Nissan Leaf. According to industry rumours, Renault-Nissan has got its costs down to below $400 per kwh, so if it can continue this progress its cars will become much more competitive.</p>\n<p>Other technical improvements are on the way, including systems that could charge a battery in as little as five minutes. Such developments should make electric cars more usable and increase their popularity. But that will cause another problem: early adopters may find that technology changes so rapidly that their shiny new electric cars soon seem old-fashioned.</p>","rubric":"The first mass-market electric cars are arriving in showrooms.

He promptly grabbed the offending device and pretended to stamp on it. Microsoft would love to crush competitors in the smart-phone market, but it has repeatedly failed to come up with compelling offerings of its own. Now the software firm is gearing up for another assault on a business that is crucial to its future.</p>\n\n<p>On October 11th Microsoft is due to unveil phones from manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung that incorporate its new operating system, Windows Phone 7 (WP7). An accompanying media blitz will seek to position it as an attractive alternative to Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Symbian, which powers many Nokia phones (see chart). The stakes are high for Microsoft and for Mr Ballmer, whose stewardship of the firm is the subject of intense debate. Microsoft’s share price has fallen by almost 20% since the beginning of this year, while the S&amp;P 500 stockmarket index has risen by 4%. </p>\n<p>Microsoft hopes not only to profit from selling licences for its software but also to push its other services via the phones. Bing, the firm’s internet search engine, Xbox Live, its gaming platform, and Zune, its music and video player, are baked into the new operating system. Microsoft is also betting that WP7 will help it preserve its once vice-like grip on the workplace. That hold is slipping as firms let employees toting iPhones and Android-based devices use them for work.</p>\n  <p>The new phones boast a slick touch-screen interface and several novel features, including one that makes it easier than on most smart-phones to post news and photos to social networks on the move. Microsoft has also laid down minimum standards to which phonemakers must adhere for things such as built-in cameras. Some earlier Windows phones suffered from poor hardware. “There isn’t a thing about our approach to this business that we haven’t changed,” says Greg Sullivan, a Microsoft executive.</p>\n<p>The firm is also expected to spend enormous sums promoting its new system. According to some estimates, it has earmarked $400m-500m to boost WP7, an amount that is likely to be matched by phonemakers and telecoms companies that will offer the new devices. By comparison, Motorola, Verizon and Google spent $100m on the launch of the Android-powered Droid smart-phone at the end of 2009, reckons Deutsche Bank. Microsoft is also taking to the courts. Last week it sued Motorola, arguing that the firm’s phones violated some of its patents.</p>\n<p>Such legal quarrels are unlikely to halt the rise of Android. Google’s operating system is now the most popular one among recent buyers of smart-phones in America, although Apple will become a stronger competitor if it releases a Verizon iPhone, as has been rumoured. “Microsoft is way behind the competition and the chances of it catching up are fairly low,” says Brent Thill of UBS, an investment bank. He points out that it will take time to persuade developers to create a rich range of software applications for Microsoft’s operating system. IDC, another research company, reckons that by 2014 Microsoft will still trail both Apple and Android, as well as Research in Motion (RIM), the maker of the BlackBerry. </p>\n<p> Hence persistent speculation in Silicon Valley that the software behemoth, which has a $37 billion cash pile, might be tempted to bid for RIM, whose phones are popular with corporate road-warriors. If Mr Ballmer is still around to negotiate such a deal, it might be the best chance he has of putting Microsoft’s stamp on the smart-phone world.</p>","rubric":"The software giant is desperate to make a splash in the smart-phone business","id":"17202417"},{"section":"Business","headline":"Beaming in Grandma","title":"Video communication","content":"<p>TECHNOLOGICAL prophets have forecast the triumph of video calling ever since 1936, when Germany’s Reichspost launched the first public videophone service. But a flurry of announcements from technology companies suggests that its time may have come at last. On October 6th Cisco unveiled a video-calling system for the living room called “umi telepresence”. The same day Logitech launched a television set-top box that doubles as a videophone. Microsoft’s new Kinect Xbox game console, due in November, offers video conferencing. </p>\n<p>The market for professional video gear is also in flux. Skype, a service that allows users to make calls from their personal computers (PCs), is moving into corporate territory by offering video conferencing, among other bells and whistles. PCs from HP will soon come with video software from Vidyo, a start-up. And in April Cisco bought Tandberg, another maker of video gear, for $3.3 billion.</p>\n<p>Video communication is becoming more popular, in part because the technology is improving. Video calls accounted for about 40% of the 95 billion minutes that people spent on Skype in the first half of this year. Although Cisco has sold only about 900 telepresence rooms so far, this is far from shabby, considering that such systems cost up to $350,000 a pop and often entail expensive network upgrades (with which the firm makes most of its money). Vendors of cheaper systems, such as Polycom, are not doing badly either.</p>\n      \n  <p> Scott Morrison of Gartner, a market researcher, says that video communication is spreading from one place to another. Having used it at home to let Grandma see the children on the PC, people now feel more comfortable trying video communication at work. Most important, senior executives have warmed to the high-end telepresence systems sold by Cisco and others, boosting the use of the technology further down the corporate hierarchy. </p>\n<p>Cisco and Logitech want to build on this momentum, particularly in the home. Cisco’s gear is the more daring because it is a dedicated video-calling system. The package includes a camera and a console, which together cost $599. Users also have to pay $25 a month for unlimited calls. And they need a high-definition television set as well as a fast internet connection to get good results.</p>\n<p>Yet despite all the progress, video communication is probably still not ready to take the world by storm. Most systems are not compatible: common technical standards are years away, as is a common video phone book. And video-calling may begin to encounter stiff resistance. Gartner forecasts that the growth of high-end telepresence systems will allow companies to keep more workers at their desks, saving 2.1m airline journeys per year by 2012 and cutting car-rental costs (see <a href=\"/node/17209522\">article</a>). But it is not clear that travelling salesmen, for example, will take to the technology. </p>\n<p>Another open question is whether customers will plump for dedicated video-communication systems over those that also serve other purposes, such as a PC or a game console. Companies need both types: dedicated ones for important meetings and PC-based ones for everyday communication. But will consumers spend a few hundred dollars for an extra device? Then again, experts were equally sceptical when Cisco launched its executive telepresence systems.</p>\n<p>Whatever system they pick, consumers will come up with new ways to use it. Already some families host “Skype dinners”, with relatives calling in. Others never hang up, thus turning a display in the kitchen into a window on somebody else’s home. Similarly, some firms have started to experiment with “virtual water-coolers”, connecting their office kitchens by means of a permanent video link. Whether this improves productivity or simply encourages long-distance debates about football and “American Idol” is unknown.</p>","rubric":"Videophones have finally reached the living room","id":"17209514"},{"section":"Business","headline":"Drive my car","title":"Car hire","content":"<p><a href=\"#footnote1\">Correction to this article</a></p>\n<p>A NEBRASKAN called Joe Saunders is credited with starting the first car-hire business: in 1916 he began lending his Ford Model T to travelling salesmen. Business customers have been the bedrock of the industry ever since. But the recession caused corporate travel to decline by about 20%, twice as much as leisure travel did. And companies that pared their travel budgets during the downturn seem inclined to keep their employees desk-bound even as the economy recovers. So car-rental companies are revving up to attract more leisure travellers in future. </p>\n<p>For the past few months Hertz and Avis Budget, which between them have around 37% of the American market, have outbid each other in pursuit of Dollar Thrifty. That firm offers lower-cost rentals, mostly to people on holiday, making it somewhat less susceptible to economic downturns. On September 30th its shareholders voted against Hertz's $1.5 billion bid, making Avis the likely winner. Now Avis must secure regulatory approval for the deal, which may involve shedding $325m-worth of assets to avoid antitrust scrutiny. </p>\n  <p>Even if rental companies can capture more holiday drivers, they will struggle to grow even modestly in the next few years. IbisWorld, a research firm, thinks the industry’s total revenue will not return to its 2008 size of $28 billion until at least 2015. The business has already consolidated dramatically. In 1999 there were nine national car-rental companies in America; by 2009 there were just four, including Dollar Thrifty. To increase revenues, car-hire firms will instead try to develop new business lines. They have focused more on their relationships with insurance companies, providing cars temporarily to people whose own have been stolen or damaged. </p>\n<p>They are also looking to capture other kinds of customer. Zipcar, a company that supplies cars by the hour to members, has proved there is demand for shorter-term hire. In June the outfit filed for an initial public offering worth around $75m. Hertz has followed Zipcar’s lead by rolling out a programme called Connect by Hertz, which allows people to hire cars for relatively short spells. Hertz need not worry about eating into its existing customer-base, says Chris Agnew of MKM Partners, a research and trading firm. Short-term schemes attract a different set from the besuited folk who hire cars by the day. And with many households unable to afford cars, demand should be strong.</p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"In hot pursuit of the casual consumer","id":"17209522"},{"section":"Business","headline":"Dough rising","title":"Fast-food restaurants","content":"<p>“YOU can pay what you like,” says one of the two cheery female greeters at the door of Panera’s restaurant in St Louis. “We will tell you the recommended price for your meal, but it is up to you if you want to pay that, a bit more, or less.” This honour-based approach to selling fast food was launched a few months ago as a pilot scheme. The goal is to let customers who are feeling the strain of the weak economy dine with dignity among regular customers, with none of the stigma of the soup kitchen. </p>\n<p>Around 4,000 people a day visit the restaurant, which is operated as a non-profit entity under the brand Panera Cares. About 65% pay the recommended amount. The remainder are roughly divided between over-payers and those who pay less or nothing. An attempt by cynics working in a nearby courthouse to break the system by paying pennies for an armful of sandwiches and soups was blocked by limiting the offer to one meal per person in the restaurant. The store is close to breaking even. There are plans to open more “shared responsibility” restaurants soon, including one in Detroit—albeit in the sort of neighbourhood where many people should be able to afford the full asking price. </p>\n<p>The launch of this non-profit experiment was a natural extension of the customer-centric approach that has helped Panera’s shares out-perform those of other restaurant businesses over the past ten years, says Ron Shaich, who recently stepped down as chief executive of the company he built. The firm had a good recession. As other competitors cut costs during the downturn, “We decided to stay the course,” says Mr Shaich. Panera improved its salads, among other things. As a result, Mr Shaich, who is still active at the company, claims “double digit” growth in same-store sales. Panera has reported record revenues and profits. On October 5th the firm’s share price hit an all-time high.</p>\n  <p>Mr Shaich had his first big success in the restaurant business with Au Bon Pain, a chain selling coffee and cakes. In 1998 he sold that business to focus on its then smaller sister company, Panera. He believed that its more relaxed, country-style restaurants were better placed to benefit from long-term trends such as the growing demand for a “third space” for people to use when not at home or in the office. Offering free WiFi long before Starbucks did, and encouraging community organisations such as book clubs and church groups to meet in its restaurants, has helped Panera earn around $2m a store, against the Seattle coffee giant’s average of about $750,000, according to Mr Shaich. </p>\n<p>The number of Panera restaurants soared from 160 in 1997 to over 1,400 at the end of 2009, with another 80 or more due to open this year as the firm takes advantage of the weak commercial property market. Mr Shaich was in New York recently, checking out potential sites for Panera’s first Manhattan store. </p>\n<p>But competition is heating up in the “fast casual” restaurant sector that Panera helped to create. In Manhattan the chain will have to battle with hundreds of conventional diners, as well as rapidly growing chains such as Le Pain Quotidien and Pret A Manger. Then there is Starbucks, with a coffee shop seemingly on every block in wealthy neighbourhoods, and the similarly ubiquitous (and now healthier salad-serving) McDonald’s. Surviving among such giants will be difficult. Perhaps wisely, given New Yorkers’ notoriously hardnosed approach to life, Panera will not be giving them the option of paying what they like for food.</p>","rubric":"Panera’s restaurants are thriving in the downturn","id":"17209665"},{"section":"Business","headline":"A growing appetite","title":"Bright Food","content":"<p>BRIGHT FOOD is a hungry company. The Shanghai government-controlled firm is reportedly among the bidders for GNC, an American nutrition-supplement chain. And it is pursuing a deal for Britain’s United Biscuits. Although Chinese companies have bought old European or American brands in other industries such as personal computers and cars, they have not shown much of an appetite for food and drink so far. But as their global reach grows, the Chinese are developing a taste for Western snacks. </p>\n<p>United Biscuits, which makes such favourite British snacks as McVitie’s digestive biscuits, Jaffa Cakes and Hula Hoops, has been put up for sale by Blackstone and PAI, a French-American private-equity firm. The would-be buyer already runs four listed companies and has 3,300 retail shops throughout China. Bright Food makes dairy products, ice-cream, tinned food, sweets, honey products and rice wine but no biscuits. The deal would value United Biscuits at more than £2 billion ($3.2 billion). </p>\n<p>Why does Bright Food want to buy a debt-laden business that has been on the block for a while without attracting a serious bid for the whole business? One reason is the need to sweeten the company’s image: Bright Food was implicated in a scandal two years ago when six babies died from drinking baby formula contaminated with melamine, an industrial chemical. Chinese consumers still distrust domestic foodmakers and are willing to pay a premium for foreign brands. Moreover, United Biscuits would give Bright Food a road into foreign food markets that it would otherwise have to build slowly and expensively.</p>\n  <p>Most of all, China’s biscuit market is booming. According to a recent report by Euromonitor, a research firm, retail sales of biscuits in China are gathering pace with a growth rate of 9% so far this year. Kraft, an American firm that makes the popular Oreo cookie, has done best, capturing 17% of the market. Bright Food is keen to acquire from United Biscuits the secrets of baking bestselling snacks. </p>\n<p>When Kraft took over Britain’s Cadbury earlier this year, the British press fumed about the loss of a much-loved chocolate-maker. Bright Food believes it can avoid a public outcry. It argues that United Biscuits is already owned by foreigners. Moreover, the firm says it is not trying to take out costs—a euphemism for closing factories and slashing jobs. That has not stopped the <em>Daily Mail</em>, a newspaper that claims to be the voice of middle England, from spluttering about a “hammer blow” to British manufacturing.</p>\n<p>Even if the takeover of United Biscuits goes ahead smoothly, commercial success may prove elusive. Several prominent purchases by Chinese firms have flopped. In 2004 France’s Thomson and China’s TCL formed TTE, the world’s largest television manufacturer. The joint venture has been an unmitigated disaster. A year later Lenovo, a Chinese maker of personal computers, bought IBM’s computer business, only to find that it overpaid mightily for the American firm. Bright Food may end up with indigestion.</p>","rubric":"Why a Chinese food company wants to gobble up Western outfits","id":"17209645"},{"section":"Business","headline":"Riding the tiger","title":"Irish companies","content":"<p>AS IRELAND’S government bails out its banks yet again and wrestles with a budget deficit a third as big as its GDP, prompting a downgrade by Fitch, a credit-rating agency, on October 6th, many Irish businesses are struggling. Failure rates have exceeded 2009 levels for all but two months so far this year. Curiously, though, the financial crisis has made some firms more competitive than they were at the height of the boom.</p>\n<p>The costs of running a business in Ireland have dropped steeply. Office rents have fallen by 50% and labour costs are 10% lower than in early 2008. The euro has weakened against most global currencies, favouring exports out of the euro zone.</p>\n<p>Irish companies with global reach are benefiting, especially if they have a foothold in fast-growing emerging markets. Kerry Group, which supplies food ingredients and flavours to 140 countries, saw a 6.7% growth in sales and a 12.9% growth in trading profit in the first half of the year, compared with the same period in 2009. </p>\n\n  <p>Smurfit Kappa, a leading maker of packaging in Europe and Latin America, is also regaining lost ground. It cut costs drastically after going public at an inflated price in 2007. Although CRH, a maker of building materials, is heavily exposed to the construction downturn in America and Europe it has joint ventures in Turkey, China and India and a strong balance-sheet. These two companies are seen as a safer bet, when it comes to paying their bills, than the government. That at any rate is the market view, according to the price of a credit-default swap which pays out if the borrower defaults (see chart).</p>\n<p>Life is much harder for companies that rely on Irish and British consumers. Construction and service outfits have been hit hard. Musgrave, which owns supermarket and convenience-store brands in Britain, Ireland and Spain, has seen retail margins drop. Since 2008 the average revenue from a weekly shop at its supermarkets has fallen from €150 ($208) to €125. Musgrave supports retailers, which operate its franchises, such as SuperValu in Ireland and Northern Ireland and Londis in Britain, rather than employing them directly. It has acted as their banker when bank credit has dried up. Luckily it is a cash-rich, privately owned company with net debt of a mere €59m at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>Many businesses, including retailers, would be in much better shape if they could negotiate cheaper leases. Most leases written before March this year, when the law was changed, only allow for rents to be increased when they are reviewed. Since some were written at the height of the property boom they are well above the prevailing market rate. But cutting cheaper deals with landlords (or their banks) has not been easy. The Irish Business and Employers Confederation is lobbying the government to break the logjam.</p>\n<p>Beyond even the government’s control, however, are international macroeconomic developments, including pending decisions in Britain and America for new rounds of central-bank stimulus. Those would tend to weaken the dollar and sterling against the euro, making life for Irish exporters more difficult again. </p>","rubric":"It’s not all Celtic gloom for the well-placed entrepreneur","id":"17209633"},{"section":"Business","headline":"The other demographic dividend","title":"Schumpeter","content":"<p>GLOBALS is one of those fast-growing Indian IT companies that Westerners simultaneously admire and fear. Founded in 2000, it already has offices in 11 countries and customers around the world. The chairman and chief executive, Suhas Gopinath, is just 24 years old. Most of his employees are also in their mid-twenties. </p>\n<p>Mr Gopinath is an illustration of a striking business revolution. Emerging-world businesses have traditionally been obsessed with seniority. Ambitious youngsters in countries like India have been equally obsessed with job security. Well-paying jobs, preferably with multinational firms, are the key to success in the marriage market. But this is changing rapidly.</p>\n<p>Nandan Nilekani, one of the founders of Infosys, reports that he now comes across mould-breaking young leaders wherever he goes in India. They are even to be found in big companies such as ICICI, a leading bank, Hindustan Unilever, a consumer-goods giant, and Comat Technologies, which provides information to rural Indians. Vivek Wadhwa, an American academic who studies entrepreneurship, says he is inundated with requests for meetings whenever he visits the emerging world. He met 125 fledgling entrepreneurs during a recent trip to New Delhi and will talk to as many as he can manage in Beijing soon.</p>\n  <p>The rise of young entrepreneurs is extending the meaning of the demographic dividend. Demographers have often noted that most of the emerging world will stay young while the rich world ages. In 2020 the median age in India will be 28, compared with 38 in America, 45 in western Europe and 49 in Japan. But the dividend will be paid not just in the form of more favourable dependency ratios but also in a more entrepreneurial business culture. Young people are innately more inclined to overthrow the existing order than are their elders. This predisposition is being reinforced by two big changes in the emerging world. </p>\n<p>The first is the information-technology revolution. The Boston Consulting Group calculates that there are already about 610m internet users in the BRICI countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and Indonesia). BCG predicts that this number will nearly double by 2015. And in one respect many consumers in emerging markets are leapfrogging over their Western peers. They are much more likely to access the internet via mobile devices (which are ubiquitous in the emerging world) rather than PCs. That gives local entrepreneurs an advantage, says Rob Salkowitz, the author of “Young World Rising”. Whereas Western companies are hampered by legacy systems and legacy mindsets, they can build their companies around the coming technology. </p>\n<p>The second is a pro-entrepreneurial revolution. Global institutions such as the World Bank and the World Economic Forum have helped to popularise entrepreneurialism. Mr Gopinath was encouraged to stick to his guns as an entrepreneur when the WEF elected him its youngest ever Young Leader. Several big companies have also encouraged the trend. Microsoft is helping local businesses and NGOs improve information-technology infrastructure. Goldman Sachs is spending $100m on female entrepreneurs, many of them in emerging markets. </p>\n<p>But even more important than these external nudges are internal changes. The rise of a cohort of highly successful local start-ups such as India’s Infosys, Argentina’s Globant and Ghana’s SOFTtribe has had a dramatic effect on thinking across the region. These companies have demonstrated that young entrepreneurs can succeed mightily: the seven founders of Infosys were in their 20s when they set the company up. They have also created a group of middle-class people who have the wherewithal to bankroll risk: parents who have made money in Infosys or young people who decide to set up on their own after a few fat years in the corporate world.</p>\n<p><a name=\"great_expectations\"></a><br><strong>Great expectations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These young entrepreneurs have already begun to shape some markets such as mobile video games and online karaoke. They have also demonstrated an impressive ability to identify gaps in other markets. Three years ago Bright Simons, a young Ghanaian, came up with an ingenious idea for dealing with the epidemic of counterfeit drugs. He asked drug producers to tag their products with unique bar codes. Consumers can then use their mobile phones to send a copy of the bar code to the producers to make sure the drugs are authentic. Kamal Quadir turned his back on a career on Wall Street in order to found CellBazaar, which provides the 20m subscribers to Bangladesh’s GrameenPhone with a virtual marketplace where they can sell things as humble as sacks of potatoes. </p>\n<p>This argument needs to be qualified. China, the emerging world’s most powerful engine, is ageing rapidly, thanks to the one-child policy: by 2020 the average age in China will be 37, almost the same as in America. Young entrepreneurs have plenty of obstacles to mount. In Nigeria the fashion for cyber-crime has all but killed legitimate cyber-business: PayPal will not accept payments from people with a Nigerian internet address. In Latin America many young entrepreneurs operate in an informal economy where innovation is rare and capital hard to come by. </p>\n<p>Yet entrepreneurial energies are moving eastward. The fact that many rich-world companies have responded to the economic slump by stopping hiring younger workers will only accelerate the shift. One of the most popular films in America at the moment is “The Social Network”, about a group of young Harvard students who founded one of the world’s fastest-growing companies, Facebook.

The show, which is loosely organised around the theme of a woman’s search for the ultimate party, features a fountain of fake blood, a burning piano and a host of dancing men. At one point Gaga is encased in a spinning gyroscope. Later she is done up to resemble a remote-controlled snowflake. At about $100 plus parking, nearly all the shows are selling out. Welcome to the supposedly doomed music business.</p>\n  <p>For the past ten years sales of recorded music have declined so steeply as to become a cautionary tale about the disruptive power of the internet. The rise of illegal file-sharing and the end of the digital “replacement cycle”, in which people bought CDs to replace tapes and records, caused spending to collapse. Sales of CDs, tapes and records have slid by 40% in Britain since 2001, according to the BPI, which represents record labels. In Japan, the world’s biggest CD sales market, the number of discs sold fell by 6% in 2008 and 24% in 2009. Price cuts meant that revenues dropped even more steeply. </p>\n<p>The rise in digital music-sales is scant compensation. People tend to buy tracks, not albums, from sites like Apple’s iTunes. They can obtain their favourite music much more cheaply than they could in the CD era. And even digital sales are now stalling. In Japan, mobile and online single-track sales rose only a shade during 2009. So far this year Americans have bought 841m digital tracks, mostly from Apple’s iTunes, according to Nielsen Soundscan—down from 847m at this point last year. Apple now offers plenty of other opportunities to spend money, from iPads to more than 250,000 apps. Music executives believe the company is cannibalising the musical part of its own business.</p>\n<p>Yet the music business is surprisingly healthy, and becoming more so. Will Page of PRS for Music, which collects royalties on behalf of writers and publishers, has added up the entire British music business. He reckons it turned over £3.9 billion ($6.1 billion) in 2009, 5% more than in 2008. It was the second consecutive year of growth. Much of the money bypassed the record companies. But even they managed to pull in £1.1 billion last year, up 2% from 2008. A surprising number of things are making money for artists and music firms, and others show great promise. The music business is not dying. But it is changing profoundly.</p>\n\n<p>The longest, loudest boom is in live music. Between 1999 and 2009 concert-ticket sales in America tripled in value, from $1.5 billion to $4.6 billion (see chart 1). Ticket sales wobbled in America during the summer of 2010, but that was partly because some big-selling acts took a break. One of the most reliable earners, Bono, U2’s singer, was put out of action when he injured his back in May. Next year many of the big acts will be on the road again, and a bumper year is expected. </p>\n<p>It is not that more people are going to concerts. Rather, they are paying more to get in. In 1996 a ticket to one of America’s top 100 concert tours cost $25.81, according to Pollstar, a research firm that tracks the market. If prices had increased in line with inflation, the average ticket would have cost $35.30 last year. In fact it cost $62.57. Well-known acts charge much more. The worldwide average ticket price to see Madonna last year was $114. For Simon &amp; Garfunkel it was an eye-watering $169. Leading musicians have also, by roundabout means, seized a larger share of the mysterious “service” charges that are often tacked onto tickets. </p>\n<p>Fans complain bitterly about the rising price of live music. Yet they keep paying for concerts. One reason is that the live-music experience has vastly improved. Lots of shiny new venues have been built since the mid-1990s, many subsidised by governments in the hope that they would revitalise decayed downtowns. And musicians are much more enthusiastic about performing live. The misery of touring was once a familiar musicians’ gripe, inspiring songs from the Rolling Stones’ “Torn and Frayed” to Ice-T’s “Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous”. But those songs were written in the days when touring was a way of marketing recorded music. Now it is a direct source of profit. </p>\n<p>However much fans pay to get into a venue (and thanks to ticket touts they often pay more than even the greediest artists charge) they tend to have cash left over. This they spend on merchandise. “We have grown along with the touring business,” says Tom Bennett, the head of Bravado, which sells T-shirts and other paraphernalia. Bravado’s revenues have more than doubled since 2007, when it was acquired by Universal Music Group—although that is partly because it has signed up new acts. And merchandise has moved well beyond the arena. Nearly all Bravado’s turnover used to come from sales at concerts. Now about half comes from retail stores. </p>\n<p><a name=\"you_can_always_get_what_you_want\"></a><br><strong>You can always get what you want</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The re-release of the Rolling Stones’ 1972 album “Exile on Main Street” in May was accompanied by a merchandising blitz that illustrates how far the business has evolved beyond selling black T-shirts. Bravado released more than 100 items, from baseball caps to boxes containing signed lithographs. There were not only album-cover T-shirts but also a higher-priced “as worn by” collection, featuring reproductions of clothes that members of the band happened to be wearing in the early 1970s. The huge range of items at different prices meant products found their way into budget stores like Target as well as dearer ones like Bloomingdale’s. </p>\n<p>The Stones are wily old businessmen: they were among the first to realise that fans would pay more for concert tickets. But even up-and-coming acts now try to build livelihoods around merchandising and live performance. Scorcher, a rapper from London who recently signed his first record deal, set up a clothing label even before he made his first video. He invariably wears his own products in the music videos that he gives away on websites like YouTube. Scorcher is not so much selling music as using music to sell. “If you buy into me musically, you will also buy into the clothing and the lifestyle,” he explains. </p>\n<p>Music’s cachet and emotional pull also make it a potent weapon for businesses that want to build their own brands. The Rolling Stones (again) led the way in recruiting tour sponsors, from Sprint, a phone company, to Ameriquest, which sold mortgages. Sponsorship can lead to musicians wearing a company’s clothes and naming songs after it: Rascall Flatts, a country music band, has done both for American Living, a label carried by JCPenney. IEG, a firm that tracks the market, estimates that the value of tour sponsorships in North America will reach $1.74 billion this year, up from $1.38 billion in 2006.</p>\n<p>Music’s best business customer is television. “Watch an evening’s worth of TV and count how many times you hear music in the background,” says Jeremy Lascelles, chief executive of Chrysalis. Your correspondent tried, and found that a new tune appeared, on average, every 40 seconds. Many necessitated payments to songwriters and the music publishers, like Chrysalis, that represent them. Publishers have become increasingly adept at hawking their wares to programme-makers. And music is not always in the background of TV programmes. Some of the most popular shows of the past few years—“American Idol”, “Glee” and “The X-Factor”—have been music shows. </p>\n<p>Because it derives revenues from business as well as consumers, publishing is much more stable than recording. Record companies’ publishing departments, which once seemed rather dowdy next to sexy, talent-spotting A&amp;R, have become vital cash machines. Publishing supplied 29% of EMI’s revenues and 45% of its profits in the year to March 2010. The outfit’s new boss, Roger Faxon, comes from that side of the business—a reflection of how the economics of music have shifted. </p>\n<p>On television, music is either supported by advertising or bundled invisibly into the cost of pay-TV subscriptions. That model is spreading from the box to the web. Free music-streaming services like We7 and Spotify have proliferated in Europe: the latter claims 10m users. America has Vevo, a music-video website linked to YouTube and owned in part by Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment. Because Vevo’s content is consistently professional, it draws advertisers. Rio Caraeff, who runs the outfit, says companies pay $25-30 to reach 1,000 viewers. That is more than television networks tend to get, although Vevo reaches fewer people and runs many fewer ads (just 15 seconds every six-and-a-half minutes). </p>\n<p><a name=\"i_feel_free\"></a><br><strong>I feel free</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The free music-streaming services have not yet brought in money commensurate with their huge audiences. In 2009 ad-supported digital music earned just £8.2m for British record companies, less than 1% of total revenues. But some have started charging fans for tunes on mobile phones—charges that may be bundled into monthly voice tariffs. Some music executives view the streaming services as the industry’s best hope. </p>\n<p>Whether they are or not depends on where the new users of free streaming websites come from. If Spotify and Vevo are drawing people away from the CD racks and the iTunes store, they are undermining the industry. If, on the other hand, people are streaming music online rather than downloading it illegally from a BitTorrent site, the industry gains. It has converted a user who is worth nothing to someone who is worth a little. And the pool of pirates is so huge at present (IFPI, an international trade group, reckons that 19 out of every 20 tracks downloaded are illegal) that it ought to be possible to make serious money from persuading people to make the switch. The growth of legitimate streaming services has driven overall revenues up in South Korea and Sweden.</p>\n<p>The possibility that music-streaming websites will turn CD buyers into freeloaders is a concern only in countries where people still buy music. That is not the case everywhere. Rampant piracy means just $19m-worth of CDs were sold in China last year—about the same as in Hungary. In such countries it makes sense to give away music, surrounding and interspersing it with advertisements. Websites like Top100.cn and Google are doing that. Record labels have also licensed music to Nokia, which bundles it into the price of its mobile phones.</p>\n\n<p>The proliferation of FM radio and multichannel television in emerging markets is also driving revenues from copyrights. At the same time, restaurants and clubs are being strong-armed into paying for the music they play. CISAC, an umbrella organisation for collection societies, has reported steady or rising receipts in the past decade (see chart 2). But there is still a long way to go before collections reach European levels in emerging markets or elsewhere in the rich world. In America, for example, radio stations do not pay performance rights, although there have been legislative efforts to change that. </p>\n<p>Rising income from live performance, merchandising, sponsorship, publishing, online streaming and emerging markets has come to counterbalance losses from declining CD sales. As a result, some musicians are singing a different tune. Last year a new group, the Featured Artists Coalition, objected to government plans to punish file-sharers by suspending their broadband connections. Its leaders, including established artists such as Billy Bragg and Annie Lennox, argue that file-sharing is a useful form of promotion. But not everybody agrees.</p>\n<p>The sharpest rebuke came from Lily Allen, a songwriter and pop singer who was then 24 years old. File-sharing was fine for long-in-the-tooth bands that “do sell-out arena tours and have the biggest Ferrari collections in the world”, she noted. But for new acts it is a calamity. As revenues dry up, record companies are becoming unwilling to invest in young artists, apart from those who have built an audience by winning talent shows on television. </p>\n<p>Ms Allen’s intervention went down badly with the digital libertarians who dominate discussion of file-sharing on the internet. She was nonetheless right—and she could have gone further. Music piracy is fundamentally a generational issue. Polls have consistently shown that teenagers and young adults are the most likely to acquire music online illegally. They naturally prefer music made by people of their own age (such as Ms Allen), who write about the sort of things they experience. So the young steal from the young, while middle-aged fans continue to buy CDs put out by middle-aged musicians. </p>\n<p><a name=\"city_with_no_children_in\"></a><br><strong>City with no children in</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In a sense, the recorded-music market is not so much dying as greying. In 2002 people aged 12 to 19 accounted for 16.4% of all spending on albums in Britain, according to TNS Worldpanel. That was almost double the share of people aged 60 or over (8.8%). The two groups have now switched positions. By 2008 teenagers accounted for just 12% of spending on albums, whether digital or physical. By contrast, the older fans’ share had gone up to 13.8%. The over-60s do not just spend more on music albums than teenagers. They spend more on pop-music albums. </p>\n<p>The consequences can be seen in the pop charts. America’s bestselling album since 2000 is “1”, a collection of Beatles hits from the 1960s. At one point last year four of the top ten albums in Britain were Beatles recordings and the number-one album was a collection of songs by Vera Lynn, who was then 92 years old. The bestselling album worldwide last year was “I Dreamed a Dream” by Susan Boyle, a middle-aged Scot. Universal Music’s bestselling album in Japan in the first half of this year was “Vocalist 4” by Hideaki Tokunaga, Japan’s answer to Harry Connick Jr. If most of your fans are middle-aged, CD sales are holding up well.</p>\n\n<p>The ageing of the recorded-music market has been accelerated by trends in retailing. As independent record shops and specialist media stores like Zavvi (formerly Virgin) have closed, supermarkets have emerged as leading outlets for music. Britain’s four big supermarkets—Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons—accounted for 24% of all music sales in the country last year. By comparison, Amazon.com had 13% of the market and iTunes only 11%. </p>\n<p>Supermarkets are patronised disproportionately by the middle-aged and the old (see chart 3). People aged 40 and over account for 62% of spending on music in Tesco, according to Kantar, a research firm. Partly because of their clientele, partly because supermarkets are mass-market enterprises, they tend to stock mainstream fare. “People who are shopping for Midlake or The National won’t find them in a supermarket,” says Geoff Taylor of the BPI, referring to two American indie bands. “But I bet Kylie Minogue’s album is there.”</p>\n<p>The growing clout of middle-aged and old listeners extends beyond recorded music. “Many of the acts selling out stadiums are old,” says Rob Hallett, the president of international touring at AEG Live. The top three American touring acts last year were U2 (average age: 49), Bruce Springsteen (61) and a double bill of Billy Joel (61) and Elton John (63). And that raises a worrying question: what happens when their knees give out?</p>\n\n<p>Many of the acts that now draw huge crowds emerged in an era of multi-album record contracts, lavish marketing and radio payola. They built their brands gradually, overcoming the occasional lousy album. They “invaded” other countries when they felt the time was right. As a result, they have legions of fans who are prepared to stump up for concert tickets. Because their songs appeal to several generations of listeners, they are attractive to advertisers and TV programme-makers. The young dreamers in shows like “The X-Factor” commonly perform songs that are more than a quarter of a century old.</p>\n<p>Some music executives fret that the stadium-filling acts will not be replaced. It is true that the starmaking machines run by the record companies are creaking. But this does not mean there will be no more popular acts. Musicians will build fan bases in other ways—through social networks, by recording music for TV or simply by trekking from gig to gig (which is how bands became famous for much of the 20th century). Some will rise with a speed that would have shocked their predecessors—witness Lady Gaga or Justin Bieber, a 16-year-old singer who was almost unknown a year ago. Those who doubt their staying power may wish to consider that adults have long believed the music their teenage children listen to will not endure as long as the tunes they grew up with.</p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"In the supposedly benighted music business, a lot of things are making money","id":"17199460"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"The big squeeze","title":"Investment banking","content":"<p>EVEN by its own notoriously cyclical standards, investment banking has been on a stomach-churning ride in the past five years. After an apparently golden age, with quarter after quarter of record profits, came the bursting of the debt bubble, a deluge of red ink and bail-outs; then, last year, firms bounced back obscenely quickly thanks to record trading profits. Now they are being squeezed once more, and this time the slump may last.</p>\n<p>American banking giants’ third-quarter results, starting with JPMorgan Chase on October 13th, will show that trading revenues fell by perhaps 20-30% from the previous quarter. With nervy investors sitting on their hands, client activity was “painfully slow across the board”, according to Jefferies, a middle-sized bank. </p>\n\n<p>Things are not much better in origination businesses. Several trends that buoyed underwriting last year, such as banks’ rush to raise capital and the boom in bond issuance as companies refinanced at low rates, have fizzled. Merger-advisory business has picked up but not by enough to compensate. As one Wall Streeter puts it: “If we extrapolated our third-quarter returns, we’d shoot ourselves.” Overall, 2010 will be a year to forget (see chart).</p>\n  <p>The ugly results will make for difficult decisions on bonuses as the year draws to a close. Firms won’t want to lose their “talent”: witness Goldman Sachs’s unusual mid year payout of restricted shares for partners affected by Britain’s bonus tax. But they face growing pressure to cut costs, and 40-50% of their revenues still flow to employees. Chopping people often comes more easily to banks than cutting pay. Bank of America is sacking up to 5% of its capital-markets unit. Others will follow—in a reversal of a hiring spree earlier this year—unless markets improve markedly in the fourth quarter. Meredith Whitney, an analyst with a reputation for prescience, thinks up to 80,000 jobs could go on Wall Street in the next two years.</p>\n<p>Capital-markets activity tends to be closely linked with overall economic growth. When output picks up, so will investment banking, argue optimists. But this time could be different because market and regulatory pressures have “substantially weakened” the economics of the business, says Shubh Saumya of the Boston Consulting Group. There is less leverage to supercharge returns. Some previously money-spinning activities are shadows of their former selves. Revenues from selling and trading structured products are almost two-thirds lower than in 2006. New regulations and accounting rules have made securitisation less appealing. </p>\n<p>The biggest impact will come from the Basel 3 capital requirements, which could be finalised at next month’s G20 summit in Seoul. Higher charges, especially for trading, could cause global wholesale banks’ risk-weighted assets to balloon by one-fifth on average, reckons Huw van Steenis of Morgan Stanley.</p>\n<p>This will force some to reassess their exposure to racy stuff. Even JPMorgan Chase, which boasts of its “fortress” balance-sheet, has said it will cut some investment-banking exposures to counter the effects of Basel 3. In future, numerous trading businesses will no longer be able to beat their cost of capital, says Brad Hintz of Alliance Bernstein, though some of these may still be run as loss-leaders. Firms are seeking out less capital-intensive opportunities in areas like equities and advisory work.</p>\n<p>Adding to the pressure on the industry’s trading culture is America’s Volcker rule, which restricts banks’ “proprietary” trading, or punting with their own capital in markets. JPMorgan Chase is shifting 45 prop traders into its asset-management arm, where they can continue to place bets, but only for clients. Morgan Stanley is looking at a possible spin-off of PDT, its quantitative-trading arm, one hope being that the bank can still make some money from the independent entity if it borrows. Senior folk at Goldman’s mighty Principal Strategies group are reportedly in talks with Avenue Capital and other non-banks.</p>\n<p>The big firms will still be able to do some gambling. Volcker allows banks to invest up to 3% of their Tier-1 capital in prop trading, hedge funds and private equity. And they can take directional bets by not hedging all of the marketmaking trades they do for clients. Goldman, for instance, went “short volatility” in equities in the second quarter—a decision it came to rue. Overall, however, investment banks will have fewer opportunities to roll the dice.</p>\n<p>Banks have not made it easy for themselves. They missed an opportunity to overhaul their operations and pay policies last year, instead preferring to ride the rebound and postpone difficult choices. With regulatory change looming, these must now be faced. Tushar Morzaria, chief financial officer of JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, says all banks have to wrestle with “very fundamental change”.</p>\n<p>As you would expect from an industry with a history of innovation, good and bad, firms are scurrying around for new opportunities. Bank of America, for instance, wants to expand in the middle market; only 2,000 of its 40,000 middle-sized corporate clients use both its commercial and investment banks. It and many others are throwing money and people at emerging markets. The hottest area of expansion is also, tellingly, the dullest: transaction services. This covers a host of businesses that provide steady income and are not too capital-intensive, such as corporate cash management, foreign exchange, trade finance, global custody and hedge-fund administration. Some banks have moved investment bankers into these less glamorous but more promising areas.</p>\n<p>Working out the relative attractiveness of different businesses is not easy because the final shape of regulatory reform is unclear. In derivatives, for instance, the common wisdom is that big dealers will be hurt as trades migrate to central clearing and exchanges. But that will depend on future capital charges for cleared and uncleared assets and the precise structure of trading venues, which are still not known. Dealers could benefit from an increase in trading volume, offsetting tighter margins.</p>\n<p>There could be other positive effects. The boss of one European bank thinks the Basel rules will cause borrowers to move away from banks and into bond markets, boosting debt-origination business for some investment banks. Others point to the $1.6 trillion cash pile on which American companies sit. If they start to deploy that in mergers and securities markets, the industry will benefit.</p>\n<p>And even if market growth is low, there will be winners, such as the “flow monsters” that have the scale and the systems to handle vast flows of client trades in shares, bonds, foreign exchange, rates, commodities and more. Perversely, this points to increased concentration. Among those likely to be in the top tier are Goldman, Deutsche, JPMorgan, Barclays and Credit Suisse. The risk is that acute competition in those areas drives down margins. Flow business is “the side of the boat all banks are running towards,” says Ted Moynihan of Oliver Wyman, a consultancy.</p>\n<p>The best firms, such as Goldman, used to make returns on equity above 30%. Even the laggards could clock 20% without breaking a sweat. Now the best that most can hope for is the teens, and even that will require chopping and changing. With such a foggy outlook, it is only natural that markets value many investment banks at or below book value. If another golden age is coming, investors can’t see it. </p>","rubric":"Why the industry’s best days may be behind it","id":"17202243"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"The magic bullet","title":"Buttonwood","content":"<p>BACK in the days of the gold standard countries competed to show their commitment to “sound money”. Nowadays, the competition is in a different direction: to create more money and weaken the currency. Brazil’s finance minister has talked of an “international currency war”. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the IMF, this week warned against using currencies as a policy weapon. </p>\n<p>Wishing that your currency would decline is not the same as making it do so. The old tactic of cutting interest rates has been pursued almost to exhaustion, although Japan lowered rates to a 0-0.1% band this week (see <a href=\"/node/17204685\">article</a>). But it is hard to create much of a yield differential within the developed world when rates are at or below 1% almost everywhere. </p>\n<p>Intervention has been pursued in the rich world by both the Japanese and the Swiss. But intervention works best when central banks co-ordinate their purchases, and which country is going to help another to devalue?</p>\n      \n  <p>So that leaves the option of quantitative easing (QE), or creating more money to purchase assets. This is largely presented as a tactic to stimulate the domestic economy by lowering the cost of finance and putting more money into the banking system. But the creation of extra money in one country ought also, other things being equal, to drive down its price in terms of other currencies.</p>\n<p>Over the past two years much of the developed world has attempted some form of QE. (The European Central Bank has done less than its rivals, which may help explain the euro’s relative strength.) Some see this as competitive QE, a game of “I can print more money than you can”. Many investors believe the Federal Reserve will be forced into another round of QE, perhaps as soon as November.</p>\n<p>The prospect of further QE helps to explain why gold, equities and government bonds are all performing well at the same time. Gold bugs are buying bullion for the understandable reason that central banks appear committed to printing more money: they fear that eventually this will lead to inflation. Stockmarkets are buoyant on the grounds that QE will eventually work to revive the economy and head off the prospect of a double-dip recession. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile government-bond yields have fallen because central banks seem to spend most of the QE money buying their own country’s debt. Traders see the central banks as putting a floor under bond prices. So QE is a kind of magic bullet, helping all asset prices to rise. </p>\n<p>That may help to explain why gold and Treasury bonds both performed so strongly in the third quarter, an unusual combination. Dhaval Joshi of RAB Capital, a fund-management group, says that there have only been four other quarters since 1980 when gold, equities and Treasury bonds have strengthened simultaneously. </p>\n<p>Why aren’t bond investors reacting with more alarm to the process of money creation? One possibility is that, with inflation and deflation both plausible consequences of a debt crisis, investors are spreading their bets, buying gold as a hedge against the former and bonds as a hedge against the latter.</p>\n<p>Another factor is different time horizons. Inflation may be the eventual result of QE in a few years’ time. But as Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Aviva Investors, points out, in the short term the risk appears to be deflation. Bond-fund managers have to worry about their results over the next quarter, or the next year, if they want to retain clients. What happens in 2015 is almost irrelevant. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it is doubtful whether the simultaneous strength of gold, equities and bonds can last much longer. Mr Joshi says the four previous periods of triple strength since 1980 were all followed by falls in Treasury-bond prices.</p>\n<p>Nor are rising gold and equity prices necessarily compatible. David Ranson of Wainwright Economics has looked at the relationship between gold and stockmarkets since 1824. Some might think that shares, thanks to their links with the real economy, would do well in inflationary times. But that is not what the data show.</p>\n<p>When gold was up by more than 20% over a five-year period, the median return from large-cap American stocks in the same era was just 2.1%. And when gold fell by more than 20%, the median large-cap return was 99%.</p>\n<p>Although asset prices may be buoyant at the moment, there are other risks ahead. Competitive devaluation is an inherently unstable system. Someone must lose their share of world trade. And a policy of boosting exports can all too easily turn into a policy of blocking imports.</p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"How the bulls believe quantitative easing will boost asset prices","id":"17202341"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"First mover","title":"Regulating Swiss banks","content":"<p>SWISS banks’ reputation for safety is not just a piece of marketing. Historically their regulators have added a “Swiss finish” to international capital rules that required their big banks to carry thicker safety buffers than firms in other countries (see chart). Supervisors judged that Swiss banks needed extra safeguards to calm the nerves of clients of their huge private-banking arms. Given the banks’ size relative to Switzerland’s economy, taxpayers needed more protection, too.</p>\n<p>The crisis has only made those arguments stronger. UBS suffered one of the worst loss rates of any large bank in the world. The government was forced to inject capital into it; many of its clients fled. To augment the new Basel 3 capital rules, a government-created committee of experts this week recommended a new version of the Swiss finish for the two biggest firms, UBS and Credit Suisse. Whereas Basel 3 requires banks to carry core capital of 7% of risk-adjusted assets, the Swiss banks will need 10%. On top of this they will have to carry another nine percentage points’ worth of contingent-capital, or “CoCo”, bonds that convert into equity if core-capital ratios fall too far. The proposals are almost certain to be adopted, and the banks will have to comply by 2019.</p>\n<p>A total buffer of 19% may seem extreme. It is not. Between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2009 UBS made losses of 13% of risk-adjusted assets on an underlying basis (ie, before tax, goodwill and movements on its own debt). Taking into account both the higher headline ratios, and more conservative rules for calculating risk-adjusted assets under Basel 3, UBS will have to carry capital and CoCo bonds of SFr60 billion-75 billion ($58 billion-72 billion), about four times the de facto requirement under the old rules. Its underlying losses during the crisis peaked at about SFr45 billion.</p>\n  <p>For the banks the immediate question is how easy it will be to issue the new instruments. Although a couple of CoCo bonds have been issued by firms elsewhere, the scale of fund-raising required is on an entirely new level, especially compared with Switzerland’s small corporate-bond market. The terms of the new bonds, which will convert into equity in two tranches with different trigger points, will make them fiddly to value. </p>\n<p>Still, claims that the bonds will be impossible to sell or more expensive to issue than equity look silly. Beyond the alternative universe of banking, creditors always carry a remote risk of extreme loss. The bonds can be viewed as a kind of catastrophe insurance for which a premium is received in return for a small chance of a big loss. If a bit daunted by the practicalities of creating a new market for these instruments, both Swiss firms seem reasonably confident of meeting the new rules without crippling their businesses.</p>\n<p>Banks elsewhere may pity the Swiss. In fact there is a fair chance that all large global firms will be required to augment their core capital with a layer of debt that converts into equity. As a complement to its new core-capital rules, the Basel club has made proposals that would also allow regulators to convert the most junior layer of banks’ debt (known as Tier-2 capital) into shares if required. For most firms this layer is about 4% of risk-adjusted assets. International discussions are also ongoing about creating “bail-in” bonds that could be swapped into core capital in a crisis. Arguably both these approaches are less fiddly than CoCo bonds. And if international regulators cannot deliver, some countries may come up with their own rules, particularly if they host banks that dwarf their economies. A Finnish finish isn’t on the cards, but a British one may well be. </p>","rubric":"Switzerland gets extra tough with its banks.

It took five months for regulators to explain what happened that day. On October 1st the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a long-awaited report explaining the causes of what has become known as the “flash crash”. </p>\n\n<p>According to the report, the stockmarket’s rapid plunge was sparked by the sloppily executed sell order of one mutual-fund group (reportedly Waddell &amp; Reed), when the market was already jittery because of economic turmoil in Europe. The firm started to sell $4.1 billion of “E-Mini” futures contracts based on the S&amp;P 500 index through an algorithmic trade, taking account only of volume, not time or price. (A sale that big usually takes over five hours to complete; this one took 20 minutes.) After the firm carried out its sell order, buyers, including “high-frequency” traders who dart in and out of trades, purchased the contracts. But as volume increased, traders started to buy and resell them in what the report calls a “hot potato” effect. The algorithm responded to the increase in volume by unloading the contracts faster, pushing prices down further (see chart). </p>\n<p>The liquidity crunch then spread to the equity market, as some automated trading systems paused in response to the dramatic price movements. Many traders withdrew from the market. Some reverted to manual systems but could not keep up with the spike in volume. “Stub quotes”, placeholder prices provided by marketmakers, caused some shares in household names to be sold for as little as a cent. Within a short while many investors had a chance to analyse trading data and returned to the market. But investors remain shaken by that afternoon’s rapid swings.</p>\n  <p>Those hoping that the report would outline steps to avert a similar crash were disappointed. The report is like “the black-box recording devices you recover from aviation disasters,” says Michael Kearns of the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s entirely descriptive. It doesn’t say how to fix anything.” The SEC has already put in place some new policies, such as “circuit-breakers” which temporarily suspend trading if a price moves by more than 10% in five minutes. But critics say still more needs to be done. </p>\n<p>An advisory committee on regulatory issues has been asked by the SEC and CFTC to submit recommendations later this month on how to modernise market structure and trading rules. Robert Engle of New York University’s Stern School of Business, a member of the committee, wants to use “peak-load pricing”, which would reward trading firms for staying in the market during periods of high volatility. Others worried about the hyperactivity of high-frequency traders have suggested charging them for each trade they break, although that would not necessarily improve liquidity and is an idea that is unlikely to be pursued. </p>\n<p>Stub quotes are likely to be eliminated. This could help address “90% of the issues we saw on May 6th”, says Andrew Lo of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The SEC is also considering rules that would prevent trades from occurring unless they fell within a certain range based on the security’s current price. These “limit-up/limit-down” trading parameters would help avert dramatic swings in prices, just as circuit-breakers do, but without causing trading to seize up. And regulators would be wise to do more research into the market for exchange-traded funds, which showed itself to be particularly vulnerable to price swings on May 6th.</p>\n<p>The flash-crash report provides some vindication for high-frequency trading firms, which had been widely blamed for the mayhem that day. It is true that many of them fled the market when prices plummeted but as the report points out, so did other traders. That may not save them from stricter rules. American supervisors could still act to curb their speed; Britain’s Treasury recently commissioned a study on the effect of high-frequency traders on markets. Fast as they are, they may not be able to outpace regulators. </p>","rubric":"The post mortem into the stockmarket slide of May 6th","id":"17202255"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Crude awakening","title":"Oil prices","content":"<p>THE 50th birthday of OPEC in September was accompanied by few celebrations—although philatelists salivating at the prospect of the commemorative stamps issued by the 12 countries in the oil cartel may have held private parties. Members, always mindful that not everyone is happy with their sway over oil markets, may yet permit themselves some backslapping at a gala dinner at OPEC’s next meeting on October 14th. An organisation dedicated to “the stabilisation of oil markets” and “a steady income to producers” has done a decent job of late.</p>\n<p>Benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude has mainly traded at between $70 and $80 per barrel since mid-2009. Earlier that year OPEC had cut production by 12% to support prices, which had collapsed after the credit crisis from a peak of $147 a barrel in 2008 to just $33. This June OPEC, which supplies over two-fifths of the world’s oil, declared that it was “comfortable” with $70-80 a barrel. At this price consumers do not complain too much. And OPEC’s revenues this year should hit $625 billion, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies, a consultancy, after slumping in 2009. That will be roughly the same as in 2007, when members pumped 1m barrels per day (bpd) more crude.</p>\n\n<p>But oil could be heading beyond OPEC’s comfort zone. According to Goldman Sachs, world demand in the first eight months of the year was 2.7m bpd higher than in the same period in 2009. On October 6th WTI rose above $83 a barrel, a five-month high, and retreated only slightly after reports of a surprising increase in American stockpiles. In the short term the price could get another boost from rising stockmarkets. Before the crisis oil prices tended to move in the opposite direction to equities (higher prices mean higher costs for energy-consuming firms). But since March last year, says Adam Sieminski of Deutsche Bank, oil prices and the S&amp;P 500 share index have been positively correlated (see chart). Mr Sieminski also notes the historical effect of American mid-term elections on share prices. If the optimism that customarily grips investors is repeated around this November’s poll it could put another $8 on the oil price.</p>\n  <p>In 2011 the fundamentals of supply and demand are likely to exert more upward pressure on prices. Francisco Blanch of Bank of America Merrill Lynch reckons that global demand is set to expand by 1.4m bpd as growth in developing countries offsets a decline in demand from sluggish rich countries. As a result he expects prices to hit $100 next year and to average $85 a barrel over the course of 2011.</p>\n<p>Looking still further out, the booming economies of China, India and other developing countries are set to need much more fuel in years to come. The rich world should eventually rediscover its thirst, too. Non-OPEC supplies, which have grown in recent years, may start to decline in 2012. New wells will fail to plug the gap left as older fields dry up, despite the investment that 2008’s higher prices encouraged. OPEC is likely to respond by calling on its spare capacity—belonging mainly to its biggest member, Saudi Arabia. OPEC is tight-lipped about how much it has on tap. Some estimates put it at about 5m-6m bpd, though others think the amount that could readily hit the market is much lower.</p>\n<p>Such calculations determine estimates of when demand will begin to outpace supply, a circumstance that, just as in 2008, is likely to cause precipitous price spikes. Jeffrey Currie of Goldman Sachs reckons that demand could be “bumping up” against capacity in 18 months. Other analysts with greater doubts about global growth and more optimism about OPEC’s capacity give it four years or more. Given the havoc of 2008 neither OPEC nor oil buyers are likely to greet the moment with a party, let alone a run of special stamps. </p>","rubric":"A stable commodity may be about to get more volatile","id":"17204675"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Easy does it","title":"The Japanese economy","content":"<p>JAPAN’S economy has long been sickly. It now also has to contend with a stronger yen, thanks in part to loose monetary policy elsewhere in the rich world. That alone gave the Bank of Japan (BoJ) reason to act on October 5th. So too did criticism that it has not done enough to spur the economy, which has inspired Japanese politicians to suggest legislation to weaken the central bank’s independence.</p>\n<p>Whatever its motivation, the BoJ this week took three modest but symbolic steps. First, it lowered its policy rate from 0.1% to a range between zero and 0.1%. That signals to the market, and to disenchanted politicians, that the BoJ cares. Second, the BoJ stated that it would maintain its virtual zero-rate policy until there was “medium- to long-term price stability”. Until deflationary Japan sees consumer prices rise by between 0% and 2% a year (with an unofficial aim of 1%), the long-standing near-zero policy rate will remain.</p>\n<p>Third, the central bank said that it would consider establishing a programme to buy public- and private-sector assets from banks—including commercial paper, corporate bonds and perhaps even exchange-traded funds and Japan real-estate investment trusts. Since the financial crisis Japan has continued to accept financial instruments as collateral in order to pump money into the system, but has not bought the assets. The effect would be to restart the policy of quantitative easing that Japan used to claw out of its banking crisis between 2001 and 2006. The initial amount under consideration is about ¥5 trillion ($60 billion), ¥3.5 trillion of which is for public-sector debt. That is on top of a sum of ¥30 trillion already budgeted for BoJ loans to banks.</p>\n  <p>The market had expected some form of easing but had not imagined a whittling of interest rates, however symbolic. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average hit a two-month high on October 6th and bonds rose sharply. From a political standpoint, too, the moves were a success. The finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, said he expected the actions to weaken the yen and improve the economy. “Very timely,” gushed Banri Kaieda, the economics minister. </p>\n<p>Whether the BoJ’s actions will have any lasting impact on the economy is another matter. The change in the policy rate does not mean much in practice: it merely reinforces the message that low rates are here to stay for a while. The asset-purchase programme is as yet too small to matter. An expected round of fresh quantitative easing by America’s Federal Reserve later this year will put more upward pressure on the yen, which on October 7th reached a 15-year high against the dollar, about where it was before last month’s currency intervention. Still, the BoJ seems willing to respond to a worsening economic climate and to political heat. The psychological boost that represents should not be discounted. </p>","rubric":"Symbolic moves by the Bank of Japan","id":"17204685"},{"section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"All his fault","title":"SocGen's rogue trader","content":"<p>A COUNTRY bumpkin from Brittany, seduced by a corrupt banking system and the avarice of his bosses, or “a crook, a fraud and a terrorist”? These were the competing descriptions that a French court was asked to weigh in the case of Jérôme Kerviel, a rogue trader who almost laid low Société Générale, France’s second-biggest bank. On October 5th the court ruled unequivocally that Mr Kerviel was guilty, sentencing him to five years in jail, the maximum sentence it could hand down (although it suspended two years of the term). Mr Kerviel, who has become something of a popular hero in France for outwitting fat-cat bankers, is appealing against the decision.</p>\n<p>The court’s order that Mr Kerviel repay the bank €4.9 billion ($7 billion), the amount that it lost in January 2008 unwinding his trades, also caused public consternation. Although Mr Kerviel has no hope of repaying even a fraction of this sum, the award in effect repudiates his argument that the bank shared the blame for his trading because it had looked the other way when his positions were profitable. Happily for SocGen it also makes it more difficult for shareholders to sue the bank.</p>\n<p>Even so, SocGen has lots of egg on its face. Its weak oversight allowed a relatively junior employee to place bets worth more than the bank’s entire capital. Although SocGen has since spent €130m tightening its controls, Britain’s Financial Services Authority fined the bank in August for weaknesses in its record-keeping and reporting. </p>\n  <p>In this SocGen is not unique. Several other banks have been fined for similar misdemeanours. Traders routinely talk about mysterious trades appearing or disappearing, and of the difficulty of reconciling positions at the end of the day. In benign markets and with honest employees these mistakes usually balance one another out, but SocGen’s experience sounds a loud warning to all investment banks and their regulators that they need to pay more attention to the boring old back office.</p>\n<p>The case of Mr Kerviel—like that of Nick Leeson, whose bets almost two decades ago destroyed Barings Bank—should not obscure wider questions, either.

A flood following a drought is a reasonable description of recent flows of private capital to emerging markets. During the worst of the crisis these flows collapsed, sending at least a few emerging economies into the arms of the IMF. Now, attracted by the developing world’s better growth prospects and exceptionally low interest rates in rich countries, money is surging back.</p>\n<p>It is hard to know just how much cash is flowing in: complete data on countries’ balance-of-payments positions are available only with a long lag. Robin Brooks, an economist at Goldman Sachs, has worked out a measure of net capital inflows from figures on countries’ foreign reserves and current-account balances. He reckons that flows into 20 big emerging countries are now running at a faster pace than before the crisis. According to his estimates, net capital inflows to these countries between April 2009 and June this year ran at an annualised pace of $575 billion, well in excess of average annual inflows of $481 billion in the two years prior to September 2008.</p>\n<p>As with monsoon rain, so with foreign capital. Policymakers in emerging economies welcome this money but not unreservedly. Many fret that the upward pressure on exchange rates from the surge in foreign capital will cause their currencies to appreciate too much. Critics point out that some appreciation is due: a rise against rich-world currencies is both a natural consequence of the faster growth of emerging economies and a way to correct global imbalances. Emerging-market policymakers would argue that their only concern is to prevent their exchange rates from overshooting. They could cut interest rates to make their economies less attractive to foreign money. But at the moment most are raising rates to curb inflation. </p>\n  <p>If they do not want their currencies to rise, governments in this position can intervene to try and dampen (or even prevent) the appreciation. Some countries are trying to use capital controls to limit the inflows of foreign money, or at least to discourage the most fickle kinds of capital. China has long applied stringent controls. On October 4th Brazil doubled a tax it charges foreigners on investments in fixed-income securities to 4%. A day later South Korean regulators said that they would soon begin to audit lenders handling foreign-currency derivatives to curb volatility caused by capital inflows. More typically, countries intervene by selling their own currencies and accumulating foreign-exchange reserves. Because fast GDP growth and the capital flows it attracts will eventually spur higher inflation, the authorities’ ability to stop a real currency appreciation is limited. Still, analysis by Mr Brooks and his colleagues shows that many countries have been trying to prevent their currencies from rising in nominal terms and that some have dramatically ramped up their interventions from pre-crisis levels. Despite the headlines they find that China is not the only big intervener—and that others have been working much harder to hold their currencies down.</p>\n<p>The economists note that the currencies of emerging Asian countries face the strongest upward pressure because of changes in the destination of private capital. As flows to eastern Europe and Africa have shrivelled, Asia’s share of the total flow of capital to the emerging world has gone from 61.3% in 2007 to 78.6% in the first half of 2010. Latin America’s share has also increased, from 15.2% to 20.9% over the same period. These are rising shares of a growing total, meaning that both regions are now getting more private capital than they were before the crisis. This effect is particularly marked for emerging Asia (see left-hand chart).</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"a_sense_of_reserves\"></a><br><strong>A sense of reserves</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mr Brooks and Fiona Lake, one of his colleagues, have looked at annual foreign-exchange interventions by central banks in emerging Asian economies, tracking the pace at which they built up reserves by buying foreign currency. They argue that it is important to scale absolute amounts by the country’s base money supply, pointing out that the effect of a $1 billion intervention by Singapore has a much bigger effect on the domestic economy than similar action by China. Comparing 2010 with 2006, the year before the crisis, they find that South Korea and Taiwan have vastly increased their meddling in currency markets (see right-hand chart). Relative to the size of its economy, China’s intervention is small in both years, and smaller in 2010 than in 2006.</p>\n<p>Not every country’s currency is under the same kind of pressure. India, for example, seems not to have intervened much in the foreign-exchange market, but its currency has not moved much over the past year either. Part of the reason is that capital inflows have gone mainly to finance its persistent current-account deficit. By controlling for this kind of thing the analysts find that Malaysia and Thailand have had the most “appreciation-friendly” regimes in Asia. Malaysia has largely been content to let its currency float upwards. The ringgit has risen by over 10% against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Malaysia’s reserve accumulation has been much smaller in 2010 than in 2006. South Korea, by contrast, has been absorbing virtually all of the upward pressure on the won by accumulating additional reserves. For Latin America, Mr Brooks and his colleague, Alberto Ramos, conclude that Peru is the country that has been trying the hardest to prevent its currency from rising. Interventions by Brazil look relatively modest once its size is taken into account. Colombia has pretty much allowed its currency to rise. </p>\n<p>Currency pressures will be a big theme of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank this week and of November’s G20 summit in Seoul. The Sino-American spat over the value of the yuan tends to hog attention.

Seldom, though, do they descend into fisticuffs. But this is what seems to have happened in China on August 29th. That day Fang Shimin, a well-known scientific blogger and self-proclaimed “science cop”, was attacked in the street by a gang. Nor was this the first such incident. In June Fang Xuanchang (no relation), a science journalist on <em>Caijing</em> magazine, was on the receiving end of similar treatment.</p>\n<p>So far, it might be thought by smug Westerners, so depressing. But then there was a twist in the tale. One of the objects of the two Fangs’ criticisms, Xiao Chuanguo, a urologist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was arrested and charged with organising the assaults. Even more extraordinary (or perhaps not, considering that he had been detained for seven days without access to a lawyer), he confessed his guilt on television, on September 28th.</p>\n<p>Virtue, then, has prevailed. And Chinese science has taken a step towards the standards of civilised discourse that Westerners like to think prevail in their own countries. Maybe. For the more you dig into this strange tale, the more illuminating it is of the need for Chinese science to clean up its act.</p>\n  <p>Fang Shimin claims that Xin Yu Si (New Threads), the website he runs, posts about 100 allegations of scientific fraud a year, and he has become a folk hero as a result. China has no proper procedures for dealing with such fraud and Dr Fang believes that, in the absence of such official channels, a platform of the sort his website provides is indispensable to the fight against misconduct in science. </p>\n<p>Some of the accusations undoubtedly stand up and shine a light on the often-murky business of Chinese science. Many, however, are anonymous and lack specifics, making it difficult for those accused to mount a rebuttal even when they are innocent. Indeed, New Threads reminds some of those with longer memories of the hysteria of the Cultural Revolution, when anybody could post any accusation on <em>da zi bao</em> (big-character posters), and countless lives were ruined as a consequence. Not surprisingly, Dr Fang has many enemies.</p>\n<p><a name=\"threadbare\"></a><br><strong>Threadbare?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The bad blood between him and Dr Xiao in particular goes back to New Threads’ foundation in 2000. Almost immediately Dr Xiao, writing under the pseudonym of Hun Jiao Shou (Confused Professor), began criticising Dr Fang for the way New Threads went about its business. In 2001 Dr Xiao wrote to <em>Science</em> accusing Dr Fang of plagiarism. Dr Fang had written an article that drew on a paper in <em>Science</em> without, Dr Xiao felt, proper acknowledgment of the original researcher. <em>Science</em>’s editors, however, disagreed after they had looked into the matter.</p>\n<p>In 2005, after several bitter exchanges, Dr Fang managed to identify the Confused Professor as Dr Xiao. Around the same time, Dr Xiao applied to be elected to the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Dr Fang got hold of a copy of Dr Xiao’s application and made several allegations in New Threads, in newspapers and on television. He said that Dr Xiao held full-time positions in America as well as China, thus showing insufficient loyalty to his Chinese institution, and also that he included conference abstracts as well as proper, peer-reviewed papers in his publication list—though neither of these is a mortal sin. </p>\n<p>More seriously, Dr Fang alleged that Dr Xiao had exaggerated the efficacy of a potentially revolutionary surgical procedure he had invented. This operation is intended to restore bladder function to people with spina bifida, a congenital defect that causes nerve damage and a loss of sensation and muscle function below the waist. Dr Xiao’s response was to take Dr Fang to court for libel—frequently. He won two cases, lost two, and several others remain undecided. Then, last autumn, <em>Science News</em>, a Chinese-language magazine of which Fang Xuanchang was then executive editor, devoted two issues to articles questioning the safety and efficacy of the Xiao procedure—using as a source Fang Shimin’s lawyer Peng Jian, a man with no scientific or medical background.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, similar accusations were posted under the pseudonym xysergroup (xys are the initials of Xin Yu Si) on two patient-support websites in America, SpinaBifidaConnection and CareCure, apparently trying to warn patients away from clinical trials based on Dr Xiao’s procedure that are being undertaken in the United States. These accusations were odd because an independent pilot study of the technique, whose results were published formally in the August issue of the <em>Journal of Urology</em>, but which have been common knowledge since 2008, suggests most of the patients involved have indeed experienced improvements in bladder function. </p>\n<p>If this were a lone spat, it would hardly matter. But it seems symptomatic of something wider. In 2006, for example, 120 Chinese scientists, many working in the United States, wrote to the country’s science-policy officials warning of the risks of unfounded allegations and anonymous personal attacks. They called for the establishment of independent expert committees to investigate claims of scientific misconduct. In particular, they argued, investigations should be carried out in confidence and innocence should be presumed until guilt was proven. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, nothing has yet happened. No one, then, comes out looking good. What started as an attempt to lighten a dark corner of Chinese life has turned into something that looks suspiciously like a witch-hunt. The upshot is that Chinese science needs to get its house in order. Measured by the number of published papers, China is the second most productive scientific nation on Earth. Incidents like this, though, call into question how trustworthy that productivity is. And that is not a trivial matter. If China does not have honest science, its development will be impeded.

It is, though, surprisingly inert. A lump of graphite or a diamond will sit happily on a laboratory bench without bursting into flames, or even rusting, and is impervious to the action of water. Better ways of manipulating the element are therefore welcome, particularly as organic chemicals, as carbon compounds are known whether or not they have ever been part of a living creature, form the basis of much human industry.</p>\n<p>That this year’s Nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded for a better way of synthesising organic compounds is thus appropriate. The winners, Richard Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki, used palladium as a catalyst.</p>\n<p>The ball was set rolling in the 1960s by Dr Heck, of the University of Delaware. He employed palladium to promote reactions involving alkenes—molecules in which two carbon atoms are joined by what is known as a double bond (each carbon atom can form up to four bonds with other atoms, which is why there are so many types of organic compound). Dr Negishi, of Purdue University, then went on to improve the process, by involving zinc-based compounds in addition to the palladium. Dr Suzuki, of Hokkaido University, applied the finishing touches by adding boron compounds to the mix. The result is a set of chemical processes that are used regularly to make a host of drugs, such as Taxol, an anticancer agent, and other complex chemicals, like fungicides.</p>\n  <p>The physics prize was also awarded for what is, at bottom, a piece of carbon chemistry. This was the discovery of graphene, a form of carbon one atom thick. Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, of the University of Manchester, made graphene in 2004 using what may be the simplest experiment ever to win a Nobel prize: they peeled it off the surface of a piece of graphite using sticky tape.</p>\n<p>Graphene is now touted as a wonder material. It is electrically and thermally conductive, is strong and is transparent. It is thus proposed for applications that range from lightweight materials for aircraft to touch-screens for computers. Its thinness, too, gives it unusual electrical properties. One of these is that if it is placed in a magnetic field it exhibits a phenomenon known as the relativistic quantum Hall effect. This (put your analyst on danger money) means magnetised graphene is inhabited by quasiparticles, which have the quantum properties of real particles (electrons, protons and so on) without actually being particles. That is the sort of thing which might lead to truly unexpected applications.</p>\n<p>A word of caution may be in order. The 1996 chemistry prize was also awarded for a new form of carbon, buckminsterfullerene. Buckyballs, as they became known colloquially, are football-shaped molecules made of 60 carbon atoms linked by single and double bonds. Buckminsterfullerene, too, was promoted as a wonder-substance when it was discovered. Both it and its descendants, so-called buckytubes, which are cylindrical molecules made of pure carbon, are still much admired, but they have not yet lived up to their promise.</p>\n<p>In truth, graphene does look a more plausible candidate for commercialisation than buckminsterfullerene. Those electrical properties are truly exciting, and something that can be turned into a film which is both strong and thin has a lot of potential applications. But there’s many a slip ’twixt cup and lip, and no important graphene products are yet on the market.</p>\n<p><a name=\"chemistry_of_a_different_sort\"></a><br><strong>Chemistry of a different sort</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The other science prize—that for physiology or medicine—went to a technology that has already proved its worth 4m times over. That is the number of people alive today who were conceived by <em>in vitro </em>fertilisation (IVF). The winner, Robert Edwards, began his research on mice in the 1950s, before moving to people. He gradually discovered how human eggs mature to the point where they can be fertilised, but had little success getting such fertilised eggs to develop into embryos that could be implanted into women, in order that they could grow into children.</p>\n<p>The breakthrough came when he teamed up with Patrick Steptoe, a gynaecologist who was working on the then-novel technique of laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). Dr Edwards realised that laparoscopy could be used to extract eggs from women’s ovaries in reasonably large numbers (until then, he had been relying on more intrusive surgical methods to obtain them). This, combined with hormone injections to bring those eggs to the correct state of maturity before they were removed, meant that women who were infertile because their Fallopian tubes were blocked might have eggs extracted, fertilised outside their bodies by sperm from the man of their choice, and the embryos that resulted implanted into their wombs—thus bypassing the Fallopian blockage.</p>\n<p>The result, in 1978, was Louise Brown, the first of those 4m. Both Steptoe (who died in 1988) and Dr Edwards were accused at the time of playing God, being like Victor Frankenstein and so on. Even today, there was a similar reaction from the Vatican to Dr Edwards’s award. The objection seems to be that not all embryos created by IVF are then implanted and brought to term.

That nothing has been found has not deterred the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI to the cognoscenti. Despite those years of effort, SETI has done little more than dip a glass into the cosmic ocean, having looked closely at only 750 of the Milky Way’s billion or so star systems. </p>\n<p>That will soon change. The Allen Telescope Array, a cluster of radio telescopes being built in California with SETI in mind, will dramatically speed up the rate at which such systems can be explored. On top of that, as astronomers get better at discovering planets, and find more habitable ones, the number of plausible targets for SETI will increase. </p>\n<p>Until recently, SETI has been uncontroversial. What could be more wholesome than answering the question of whether humans are alone in the universe? A SETI subcommittee within the International Academy of Astronautics (IAA), a scientific lobby group, even fashioned a protocol on how to respond if a signal from aliens is received. This concludes by saying that no reply should be sent until appropriate international consultations have taken place. Mazlan Othman, the head of the UN’s Office for Outer Space Affairs (yes, there really is one) has suggested that her agency is “ready-made” for such co-ordination—leading one newspaper to dub her the “alien ambassador”. </p>\n  <p>Where things have become difficult is over whether or not researchers should be allowed to send signals into space pre-emptively, in order to attract the attention of any alien listeners who might be out there. This is called active SETI, or METI, where the “M” stands for messaging. Attempts to draft a second SETI protocol to deal with this foundered several years ago, and the chairman and two members of the IAA’s committee resigned.</p>\n<p>The acrimony was aired on October 4th at a meeting organised by the Royal Society at Chicheley Hall, in Britain. Those opposed to METI argue that broadcasting signals into space announcing the location of Earth is tantamount to ringing a dinner gong for any carnivorous, colonising or anti-social aliens who might be listening. Although Earth would be a rather long way to go for lunch, the argument is that the decision to take such a risk is not one for a handful of scientists.</p>\n<p>Alexander Zaitsev, chief scientist at the Kotelnikov Institute of Radio Engineering and Electronics, disagrees. Dr Zaitsev has access to one of the world’s most powerful radio transmitters, the Evpatoria, and he has already sent a number of “hello” signals to nearby star systems. He argues that radar astronomy, which is used to probe things like asteroids and the surface of Venus, already gives off signals that could be picked up by aliens. He is also on record, though, as saying that humans have a moral obligation to announce their presence. </p>\n<p>Even without the intervention of people like Dr Zaitsev, that may already have happened—if anyone is listening. Some people think signals emitted by television and radio stations would be detectable from nearby stars, thus rendering the debate irrelevant. Indeed, some at the meeting argued that if aliens were to use an astronomical phenomenon called gravitational lensing (in which the gravitational field of the sun bends and amplifies radio waves and light from Earth), human signals could be amplified to the point where even the light from cities would be visible.</p>\n<p>Michael Michaud, who resigned as chairman of the IAA’s SETI group in 2007, said that METI is not science but rather “an attempt to provoke a reaction”. He wants wider consultation. Seth Shostak, the group’s current chairman, disagrees. He says consultation does not guarantee a “correct” answer; it seeks merely to “spread the blame if Earth gets wiped out”—though who would be left to point the finger is unclear. He also says that because there is a small but real risk to sending messages, any international consultation would be likely to conclude that the broadcasters should “shut up”.</p>\n<p>David Brin, an author of science fiction who also resigned from the SETI group, accused it of attempting to stage-manage the discussion. He said that those proposing METI should involve more of humanity in the debate and must accept that a moratorium may be necessary. But he is also realistic. In the not too distant future, he thinks, so many people will have the power to send signals into space that it will not be possible to control intergalactic messaging. If that turns out to be true, then hope it is ET listening, not the Daleks. </p>","rubric":"An argument over whether to send messages to aliens","id":"17199376"},{"section":"Books and Arts","headline":"On top of the world","title":"Global power","content":"<p><strong>Why the West Rules—For Now: The Patterns of History and What They Reveal About the Future. </strong>By Ian Morris. <em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 750 pages; $35.

Like Mr Kennedy’s epic, Mr Morris’s “Why the West Rules—For Now” uses history and an overarching theory to address the anxieties of the present. Mr Kennedy warned American policymakers of the consequences of “imperial overstretch”, although it was the sudden implosion of the Soviet Union that proved the most spectacular vindication of his thesis. </p>\n<p>For his part, Mr Morris sets out to show two things that are just as important; first that civilisations throughout history have waxed and waned, usually for reasons their rulers were powerless to influence, and second, that the West’s dominance of the past 200 years was neither inevitable nor “locked in” for the future.</p>\n  <p>Mr Morris’s refrain is “maps, not chaps”—the belief that human destiny is mostly shaped by geography and the efforts of ordinary people to cope with whatever is thrown at them in the form of climate change, famine, migration, disease and state failure (what the author describes as the “five horsemen of the apocalypse”). He argues that “history teaches us that when the pressure is on, change takes off.” According to what he calls, somewhat annoyingly, the Morris Theorem, “Change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable and safer ways of doing things. And they rarely know what they are doing.”</p>\n<p>Among the many things the author sets out to explain is why, throughout human history, social development has gone in fits and starts, sometimes retreating in one place for a millennium or two before suddenly spurting forward again elsewhere. As a way of dramatising this, Mr Morris presents these ebbs and flows in the form of a contest between East and West. Why, he asks, did British boats shoot their way up the Yangzi in 1842 rather than Chinese ones up the Thames, and why do many more people from the East speak English than Europeans speak Mandarin?</p>\n<p>At first glance the answer is obvious. The industrial revolution began in the West in the late 18th century thanks primarily to the efforts of British engineers and entrepreneurs who sought to exploit the energy from the country’s abundant coal stocks and use it to harness the power of steam to drive ships, trains and machines in factories. The rapid march of technology gave Britain a temporary edge over every other country and allowed it to project both economic and maritime military power on a global scale that remained virtually unchallenged for most of the next 100 years, and to establish the ascendancy of the West that continues today. But why did China, with its sophisticated textile industry, advanced metallurgy, massive supplies of coal and lots of clever, inventive people not get there first? After all, a couple of centuries earlier it had been higher up the social-development scale than Britain, or indeed anywhere else in the West. </p>\n<p>And why, come to that, was Britain, rather than China, the foremost naval power of the age? More than 80 years before Christopher Columbus set sail for America with 90 seamen in three small ships, the Chinese admiral, Zheng He, was exploring the coasts of Africa and India with a total of nearly 300 much bigger vessels and 27,000 men. Mr Morris observes: “Zheng had magnetic compasses and knew enough about the Indian Ocean to fill a 21-foot-long sea chart; Columbus rarely knew where he was, let alone where he was going.”</p>\n<p>Mr Morris begins his story more than 50,000 years ago, but it only really gets going with the beginning of agriculture and the birth of large-scale organised societies after the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago. He shows how successive civilisations radiated outward from two geographically distinct cores—the “hilly flanks” of western Eurasia and the area between the Yangzi and Yellow rivers in modern China—because of their relative abundance of domesticable plants and animals. Development started in the West about 2,000 years before similar advances got going in the East. Its lead shrank from about 1,000BC on, after which East and West were roughly level until the slow collapse of the Roman empire, which represented a peak of Western social development not matched until the start of the early modern era in the 17th century.</p>\n<p>What Mr Morris shows is that over a period of 10,000 years one civilisation after another hit a “hard ceiling” of social development before falling apart, unable to control the forces its success had unleashed. For every two or three steps forward, there was at least one step back. During those periods of advance the West tended to pull ahead of the East, and during the steps back the gap narrowed again. On this went in a series of waves, each, Mr Morris says, cresting higher than the last, but with the West’s lead apparently locked in. That process continued until the middle of the sixth century AD when the East suddenly, and for the first time, spurted ahead as Europe entered the so-called Dark Ages and the Sui dynasty united China, laying the foundations for the East to hold the lead for the next 1,000 years.</p>\n<p>Although the West eventually caught up, thanks in part because it began making ships that could sail to America (the Atlantic is much smaller than the Pacific) and because its constant wars helped develop military technology, even by the mid-18th century there was not much difference between East and West. As Mr Morris observes: “…although the hard ceiling had been pushed up a little, it remained as hard as ever.” The West may have caught up, but according to a new breed of political economists, such as Thomas Malthus, iron laws governing humanity, in particular the one that held that people always converted the extra wealth earned from rising productivity into more babies to consume it, would prevent either the West’s or the East’s social development score rising much further. Malthus, however, had not reckoned on the transformative power of steam to smash through the West’s hard ceiling.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of his book, Mr Morris attempts to answer the question posed in the title. The West may still rule, but for how much longer? His conclusion is that although power, influence and commercial dynamism are shifting eastward at a relentless pace, the question itself may be wrong. If Eastern and Western social development scores continue rising at their current rates, Western “rule” will end early in the next century. But the rise in the index over the next 100 years, propelled by quantum leaps in computing power and bioscience, is so exponential that humankind itself will be profoundly changed, making distinctions between East and West seem weirdly anachronistic.</p>\n<p>There is, on the other hand, a real possibility that we fail to negotiate even the next 50 years without triggering environmental catastrophe, global pandemics or nuclear war. In which case, both West and East will simultaneously crash into the hard ceiling of our own era. Mr Morris ends on an optimistic note. If we can put off “Nightfall” long enough, he says, the difference between the trials we face today and those that eventually did in the Song dynasty in China when it pressed against the hard ceiling 1,000 years ago, or the Roman empire 1,000 years before that, is that we are so much more able to understand and counter the forces that threaten us—if we have the wit and purpose to do so.</p>\n<p>Mr Morris writes with clarity and vigour, if occasionally with a jaunty informality that becomes tiresome. That said, this is an important book—one that challenges, stimulates and entertains. Anyone who does not believe there are lessons to be learned from history should start here. </p>","rubric":"Why the West’s present dominance is both recent and temporary","id":"17199546"},{"section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Banker to the world","title":"James Wolfensohn","content":"<p><strong>A Global Life: My Journey Among Rich and Poor, from Sydney to Wall Street to the World Bank. </strong>By James Wolfensohn. <em>PublicAffairs; 448 pages; $29.95.

The friends of Jim are the global elite. He has relentless drive and a larger-than-average ego, so “A Global Life” should have been a rollicking read. Yet Mr Wolfensohn’s memoir is plodding and for the most part bloodless; more like the reminiscences of an old-school London merchant banker than a freewheeling charmer. </p>\n<p>The first half of the book charts Mr Wolfensohn’s rise from a financially insecure youth in Australia to the upper echelons of global finance, in London and then New York. He was one of the first to see the potential of the Eurobond markets. After a promising career at Schroders came to an end when he was passed over for the chairmanship (for being neither British nor an aristocrat, he was told), he moved to Salomon Brothers where he remained through the tumultuous early 1980s. The narrow, gentlemanly world of New York investment banking was coming to an end, and the new drivers were aggressive deal-makers like Mr Wolfensohn whose brazen confidence and ability to make snap judgments were essential to success. He left Salomon to establish his own firm.</p>\n  <p>But Mr Wolfensohn, to his credit, has always cared about the less fortunate, and in 1995 he leapt at the offer to become president of the World Bank. Sebastian Mallaby, who worked for<em> The Economist</em> until 1999, analysed this period of Mr Wolfensohn’s life in detail in his 2004 book, “The World’s Banker”. There is much to praise. Along with Eugene Black in the 1950s and Robert McNamara in the 1970s, Mr Wolfensohn was one of the bank’s most influential presidents. He put debt relief for poor countries firmly on its agenda, along with a more open discussion of corruption. He wooed the bank’s critics, especially some of the hypercritical NGOs. Above all, his indefatigable energy served as a tonic to an institution that had been in the doldrums for some time. </p>\n<p>But all this came at a cost which Mr Wolfensohn’s book ignores. As Mr Mallaby and many others have chronicled, the president’s management style was often temperamental. He threw tantrums and threatened to resign. He also had little tolerance for internal dissent, driving out senior managers who disagreed with him. In his account the bank’s much-trumpeted “Comprehensive Development Framework” was a great leap forward in development thinking. His critics saw it as unrealistic, using a mindless “win-win” argot to paper over the inevitable conflicts that arose from competing objectives. Mr Wolfensohn depicts himself as a heroic figure, battling tirelessly on behalf of the developing world against the baronies of the bank’s bureaucracy. Others complain that the result was actually an increase in bureaucracy as the bank created more and more safeguards to ring-fence itself from risk. Although some of these barriers were undoubtedly beneficial, they also hugely increased costs both for the bank and its borrowers. These were estimated at between $200m and $300m in 2001. </p>\n<p>Mr Wolfensohn’s legacy was burnished by two events. His successor at the bank, Paul Wolfowitz, proved to be a disaster, which served only to enhance Mr Wolfensohn’s reputation. Secondly, George Bush went on to appoint the Australian former banker as a special envoy of the quartet of countries that was working to facilitate a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr Wolfensohn’s analysis of how he came to realise he was being used by both the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, and the American administration, neither of which was interested in achieving a real solution, is one of the more gripping chapters in the book.</p>\n<p>Description triumphs over reflection in Mr Wolfensohn’s account of his life. For a man who spent so many years at the top of international banking he has little to say about global finance, a peculiar omission given the troubles of the past three years. His account of his tenure at the World Bank hints at how America, while pressing developing countries to follow rule-based governance, blithely bent the rules so as to force the World Bank to do things that helped secure America’s interests. This was most visible during the Russian debt crisis in 1998, yet, again, the book contains no deeper discussion of this. </p>\n<p>Mr Wolfensohn has generally been a force for good in the world. He can be enormously charming and brutally honest. His book, sadly, is neither. </p>","rubric":"It's never lonely at the top","id":"17199536"},{"section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Killer instinct","title":"A literary memoir","content":"<p><strong>The Hilliker Curse: My Pursuit of Women. </strong>By James Ellroy. <em>Knopf; 203 pages; $24.95.

In March 1958, on his tenth birthday, his mother, Jean Hilliker, asked James, an only child, which of them he wanted to live with: her or his father. When he chose his father, she walloped him hard enough to knock him off the sofa and onto a glass coffee table. The stunned youngster recalled something he had read in a book about witchcraft and issued a curse on his mother. He wished her dead. Three months later her body was found dumped by the side of a road in suburban Los Angeles. The killer was never identified, the case never solved.</p>\n<p>This grotesque coincidence, Mr Ellroy explains in his remarkable memoir, gave rise to an agonising sense of guilt and a lifelong search for women’s forgiveness. His quest took an unconventional course that may seem at once shocking and strangely familiar to readers of “The Black Dahlia”, “LA Confidential” and Mr Ellroy’s other bestselling crime novels.</p>\n  <p> It began with his peeping through windows into girls’ bedrooms and soon escalated to breaking and entering. Young Mr Ellroy would wander around the girls’ houses when they were not at home, sniffing pillows and fondling hairbrushes. He was always careful to keep his torch pointed at the floor if he was there at night and to leave no trace of his visit. Afterwards he would lie in the dark, fantasising, and masturbate. Progress from looking to touching, or even talking, was slow. Acute acne and chronic awkwardness created difficulties that were compounded, in his 20s, by alcoholism and drug addiction. He would scrimp and save in order to spend nights with Sunset Strip hookers, often just cuddling and chatting.</p>\n<p>Self-belief, at least, was never a problem, and with success as a writer came greater success with women. He describes his relationships with the four women, apart from his mother (well, sort of apart from her), who have mattered most to him. Helen, Joan, Karen and Erika were all comprehensively Jean Hillikerised, with mixed results. Joan no longer speaks to him, though he remains close to Helen and Karen. He moved in with Erika in 2009. “Erika stepped out of the shower yesterday morning,” he writes in the book’s closing pages. “She looked startlingly like Jean Hilliker.” One wishes them the best of luck.</p>\n<p>Mr Ellroy’s day-to-day life seems to involve little apart from writing and promoting his books, and lying around in the dark fretting about women. Fame and riches and the passing of years have made no difference. In all of this, friends and family are nowhere to be seen. As one of his ex-lovers perceptively tells him: “All you’ve got is your audience and your prey.”</p>\n<p>To which she might have added: and your prose style. Mr Ellroy’s distinctive on-page voice is part 1950s jive-talking jazzman, part high-minded seeker after eternal truths. “Meander and milk the moment for meaning,” he cautions himself at one point, mid-courtship, when he fears things are moving too fast. “Pile on the pianissimo and postpone the pizzazz.” Such gee-whizzery is hugely enjoyable in small doses, but it involves a trade-off. What Mr Ellroy gains in surface sizzle he loses in emotional resonance. It is cool, but it kiboshes any semblance of sincerity.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it would be difficult to doubt his 50-year obsession with his dead mother. “It’s kept me hungry and working hard,” he shrugs. No kidding. Mr Ellroy, incidentally, has kept the cover designers at Random House working hard as well. The jackets of all of his 18 books look fantastic. Few contemporary novelists are as consistently well served. Once again the Random House designers have come up with the goods for “The Hilliker Curse”—as, in his weird way, has Mr Ellroy.</p>","rubric":"The man that mother made","id":"17199518"},{"section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Carve her name with pride","title":"Edith Cavell","content":"<p><strong>Edith Cavell. </strong>By Diana Souhami. <em>Quercus; 416 pages; £25.

The German occupying authority accused her of sheltering Allied soldiers at the school and helping them to escape to Holland. As Diana Souhami relates in a new biography, when the priest arrived at the prison the evening before the execution, the German guard told him she was a fine woman–“like this”, he said, and stiffened his back.</p>\n<p>The execution was a propaganda coup for the Allies. German violation of an Englishwoman made better copy than the messy story of trench warfare. The Bishop of London deplored this “foulest crime” against “a poor defenceless English girl”. The prime minister, Herbert Asquith, reminded the House of Commons that such courage had built the British empire. Recruitment posters exhorted young men to “Remember Edith Cavell” and the numbers volunteering for the front doubled.</p>\n  <p>All this would have dismayed Cavell. Her strength had less to do with king and country than the quiet spirit of Thomas à Kempis, a medieval Catholic monk whose “The Imitation of Christ” she studied all her life. Almost her last words were: “Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone.”</p>\n<p>The eldest of four, Cavell was born in 1865 and grew up in a small Norfolk village where her father was vicar. The Reverend Frederick Cavell was a stern Victorian paterfamilias who ruled his family along strict Christian lines: prayer, self-denial and duty to others. The rural poor depended on the charity of squire and parson, and the Cavell children were expected, like their parents, to minister to them. </p>\n<p>Both Cavell’s sisters took up nursing, work which Florence Nightingale, in the previous generation, had transformed into a respectable calling. Before following them, Cavell spent many lonely years as a governess, that last resort of the unmarried. “Someday, somehow, I am going to do something useful...something for people. They are, most of them, so helpless, so hurt and so unhappy.” Cavell’s prophecy would have been fulfilled if the story had ended with the ten years that followed, during which she trained and worked as a nurse in hospitals founded specifically for the destitute sick, senile and lunatic. Ms Souhami is always ready with social and historical background material, and here in particular expands on the state of public health and health provision at the time.</p>\n<p>But it’s the Brussels years and 1914 that the reader waits for. Until then, there had been nothing remarkable about Cavell, who was charming, kind, but also, according to her matron, not particularly reliable, sometimes unpunctual and always annoyingly self-contained. (This quality was to rattle her interrogators later.) In 1906, a Belgian doctor, impressed by English nursing standards, was looking for an English nurse to establish a training school in Brussels. Cavell had once been governess to a family there and spoke French fluently. One thing led to another, and she accepted the challenge. By 1914 her nurses were in demand and her reputation stood high.</p>\n<p>Most biographies wind down. Here the tension builds, even though this part of the story is well known: the German invasion, the terrible suffering, the Allied soldiers stranded after the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force, then the resistance network, the arrests, interrogations and trials. Edith Cavell played her part, but the book is as much a celebration of the Belgians she worked with as of Cavell herself. She would have approved. This is a moving story, written from the heart.</p>","rubric":"A life well lived","id":"17199528"},{"section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Man in motion","title":"Eadweard Muybridge","content":"<p>ASKED to list the great British artists of the 19th century, few people would mention Eadweard Muybridge. Even if they named the great British photographers of the same period, after William Fox Talbot, Julia Margaret Cameron and Roger Fenton, chances are that most people might not quite remember Muybridge. Yet the legacy of the man first known as Edward Muggeridge, who was born English but who worked for most of his career in California, was central to art in the 20th century and is still vital today. </p>\n<p>Muybridge is best known for his demonstration that movement could be broken down into fluid sequences of individual moments. That insight was made use of by a succession of artists, from Auguste Rodin to Francis Bacon. Muybridge’s motion studies can be fairly credited as the forerunners of the cinema. There is also evidence that in 1888 he shared with Thomas Edison some thoughts on combining a new projection system he had invented—the zoopraxiscope—with Edison’s phonograph. And the grid pattern of his bestselling books on locomotion survives in the format of comic strips.</p>\n<p>A travelling exhibition, which began at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, and has now opened in London, reveals Muybridge as much more than simply the pioneer of motion, however. Good close attention is paid to his biography, even if there are still important gaps. The very first line of the opening wall panel admits: “Where Muybridge learned his skill as a photographer remains unknown.” Other parts of his life are more familiar, in particular the fact that he coldbloodedly killed his wife’s lover. He was acquitted in part because a jury could not believe that a man who could lug the heavy and cumbersome photographic equipment of the time up into the Yosemite Valley could be entirely sane.</p>\n  <p>Muybridge did not just invent another name for himself. He excelled in a new industry, and made up more than just its technology as he went along. He was adept, for example, at marketing himself along with his photographs, and there is plenty of evidence of that in this show, from his illustrated trade cards and well-designed logos, to the many photographs of himself, quite naked, posing as a model in some of the motion studies. </p>\n<p>For each major undertaking Muybridge invented the appropriate kind of photography to suit. His investigation of galloping horses for Leland Stanford, a California politician and racehorse owner, is well known. In each stride horses lift all four hooves off the ground at once, something that George Stubbs, the most famous horse painter of the last 300 years, had guessed at but which, until Muybridge, had never been proved. The beautiful cyanotype proofs for “Animal Locomotion” have recently been restored and are being given their first public outing in this show. There are also examples of the work Muybridge did up and down the Pacific coast for the national body in charge of lighthouses, including a sequence of unusual large-format seascapes completed in the 1870s, at precisely the time that Thomas Stevenson (father of Robert Louis) was designing his lighthouses around the coasts of Scotland. </p>\n<p>The two great moments in this installation are a room containing mammoth albumen prints of Yosemite and other landscapes, and in another room, a giant panorama of San Francisco. In each, the images themselves and the way they are presented add up to an unusually exciting visual experience. But even they are not the real core of the exhibition. </p>\n<p>Muybridge was certainly a wonderful photographer, as enthusiastic and curious about his own medium as about the world he photographed. As a technician he was a remarkable pioneer. But he represents more than technical advance alone. He developed new standards to suit the new techniques, and the new markets, that were his own creation. Something beautifully photographed, Muybridge’s entire career reminds us, will be beautiful in the photograph whatever it was like in fact. That profound change in point of view altered the visual arts for ever. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"The many influences of an inventive early photographer","id":"17199556"},{"section":"Obituary","headline":"Michael Lassen","title":"","content":"<p>ALMOST nothing is known of the men who built the great medieval cathedrals. A mason’s mark chiselled on a column; a game of nine-men’s-morris scratched on a stone; a gargoyle’s half-human face, of foreman or master of works, are all that remind observers of the crowds of labouring souls who raised Canterbury or Winchester, Beauvais or Cologne. </p>\n<p> The dangers of such projects were legion. Contemporary illustrations show cathedral spires collapsing, vaults caving in, high scaffolding keeling over in a chaos of planks and poles. Casualties were expected, and were many, though the fabric accounts often could not name them. In modern times the labour is no less perilous; but in the days of health-and-safety and hard hats, accidents are rare. Hence the horror in Durham when, on September 3rd, Michael Lassen fell from a ladder as he helped to fix a new stained-glass window in the south quire aisle of the cathedral. He died some days later in hospital. </p>\n<p> Climbing up in the south quire to look at the traceries originally, he had found them heavily fissured, like all Durham’s ancient sandstone. Blocks were missing on the exterior, and one side of the main arch was worn away almost to a skeleton, as though two or three centuries of wild north-east weather had blown through it. But all the stone had been carefully stabilised before his work began. </p>\n  <p> The window was of the Transfiguration of Christ, made by Tom Denny, and one of the largest to be installed in Durham in modern times. Mr Lassen was working from top to bottom, fixing the glass he had leaded. He started with the small quatrefoil lights of the Holy Spirit and the crucifixion, proceeding down through the main panels of Christ and his followers on the mountain, with all the way the white shaft of God’s transfiguring light growing broader through the fire-and-storm colours of the glass. The four principal lights, nicknamed after the chief figures in them, were Cuthbert, Moses, Elijah and Michael; they became familiar friends. He was fitting a small panel at the bottom left-hand side, a pane of bruised blue glass that showed the broken and suffering about to be transformed by light, almost the last piece in the window, when he fell. He was not particularly high up, working at the ledge. But stone flags are unforgiving. </p>\n<p> Mr Lassen had been called in late to lead and fix this window. The man originally contracted had fallen ill, and the deadline for the installation, the end of September, was fast approaching. Help was needed fast; Mr Lassen provided it, expertly and fully. The tight timetable troubled him; but he was not a keen marathon runner for nothing. </p>\n<p> His training had been traditional, in the Government School of Stained Glass at Hadamar in Germany; though English, he had spent many childhood years in Bavaria. After working as a glazer and glass-restorer, he had turned to glass-painting and designing, gradually obtaining commissions in churches all over Britain. His own windows, at St Cadoc’s chapel in Cowbridge in South Wales, or in the Church of Sts Peter and Paul at Great Somerford in Wiltshire, showed a love of blocks of pure colour carefully contained within thick, angular leads, especially glowing blues and rich reds: the medieval way of glass. His figures, too, had a medieval solidity, dignity and stillness about them. </p>\n<p><a name=\"lead_and_fire\"></a><br><strong>Lead and fire</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The techniques needed to lead and fix his own glass had barely changed. He would stretch the H-section lead strips, or cames, to stop “creep” in the soft, ductile metal; cut them expertly straight with his pliers, so as to leave no gaps between them when they were moulded round the glass pieces; apply the hot chisel-tip of the soldering iron just long enough to melt the solder, not the lead, when joining the strips together. The double-layered and plated technique of leading Mr Denny’s glass, with the lines almost lost in the painting, was at first new to him, and correspondingly tricky. But by the time of the Durham project he had become an enthusiast, and all was going well until he fell. </p>\n<p> A memorial service for him was held at the foot of the window while the scaffolding still covered it. Mr Lassen, who worked from Bristol, was barely known in Durham, although he had once had a studio at Worship Farm, not far away. To most of the people who attended, extending the human crowd in the bottom panels of the window, he was just “that nice chap” who had had the accident. But when September 25th came, the day of dedication, he was remembered in a different way. The clue lay in George Herbert’s poem “The Windows” which was sung as an anthem at evensong. Man was “a brittle crazy glass”:</p>\n<p><em>Yet in thy temple thou dost him afford This glorious and transcendent place To be a window, through thy grace.</em></p>\n<p>As the congregation pressed through afterwards into the south quire aisle they found the windows still wreathed in incense, like the cloud of God that had enveloped Jesus on the mountain. Through it shone the glass. Its golds and blues were smoky in the evening light, but the central column blazed white, like the transfiguration of a man; and of all men, named or un-named, whose lives and skills are embedded in the stone and glass of great cathedrals. </p>","rubric":"Michael Lassen, stained-glass artist, died on September 8th, aged 61","id":"17199498"},{"section":"Economic and Financial Indicators","headline":"Overview","title":"","content":"<p><strong>America’s</strong> GDP growth in the second quarter was revised up by a tenth of a percentage point, to 1.7% at an annual rate.</p>\n<p><strong>Japan’s</strong> central bank lowered the target for its benchmark interest rate to a range between zero and 0.1%.</p>\n<p>An early estimate put the <strong>euro area’s</strong> inflation rate at 1.8% in September, up from 1.6% in August.
