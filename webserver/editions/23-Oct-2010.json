[{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Leaders","headline":"The next emperor","title":"China's succession","content":"<p>“WITH you in charge, I am at ease,” Mao Zedong is supposed to have told his successor, Hua Guofeng. It proved a disastrous choice. Mr Hua lasted a couple of years before being toppled in 1978. A decade later succession plans once again unravelled spectacularly, against a backdrop of pro-democracy unrest. Only once, eight years ago, has China’s Communist Party managed a smooth transfer of power—to Hu Jintao. Now a new transition is under way. The world should be nervous about it for two reasons: the unknown character of China’s next leader; and the brittle nature of a regime that is far less monolithic and assured than many foreigners assume. </p>\n<p>The man ordained to take over Mr Hu’s twin roles as party chief in 2012 and president the following year is hardly a household name. On October 18th Vice-President Xi Jinping was given a new job as vice-chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, which Mr Hu heads. This is a position for leaders-in-waiting. The portly son of one of Communist China’s founders, little known to the outside world until a few years ago, Mr Xi is preparing to take the helm of a country with the world’s second-biggest economy and its biggest armed forces—and which is in the midst of wrenching social change. </p>\n<p>Quite how he has risen so high in a party that, for all its growing engagement with the world, remains deeply secretive, is unclear. Mr Xi’s appointment was eerily similar to the recent anointing of Kim Jong Un in North Korea: he too was made vice-chairman of a military commission after a closed-door party conclave, without public explanation. China’s leaders at least offered a sentence on Mr Xi’s appointment, albeit at the end of an arid 4,600-character communiqué after the fifth party congress (see <a href=\"/node/17309197\">article</a>).</p>\n      \n  <p>On the positive side, Mr Xi has held some big posts in the most economically dynamic and globally integrated parts of the country: the coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang as well as, briefly, Shanghai. He is a relatively cosmopolitan figure. His wife is a popular singer. But it is impossible to assess how well qualified he is to run the country or how assured his succession is. On the face of it, one engineer whose father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution is handing over to another. But Mr Xi is a relative newcomer to the inner circle; he has not served as long as Mr Hu had in 2002. There are plenty in the party who resent the rise to power of well-connected “princelings” like Mr Xi. A two-year transition will be a test.</p>\n<p><a name=\"all_this_one_day_will_be_yours\"></a><br><strong>All this one day will be yours</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All the same, it is the immensity of the task, not the obscurity of the man, that should make the world nervous. For all their outward expressions of unity, there are signs of disagreement among Chinese leaders over what the country’s priorities should be—both on the economy and on political reform. </p>\n<p>The economy is sprinting along by Western standards, but China faces a hard adjustment to wean itself off excessive investment and exports in favour of more reliance on consumption. The communiqué unveiled guidelines for a new five-year economic plan (see <a href=\"/node/17314578\">article</a>). This calls for a more sustainable pace of growth, with wage-earners getting a bigger share of the national income. This would be good for China and the world, helping to narrow the trade surplus that annoys America so much. But the change will not be painless. Exporters fear business will suffer if wages soar or the yuan rises fast. Powerful state-owned enterprises, used to cheap credit, land and energy, will resist threats to these privileges. </p>\n<p>As for political reform, Chinese leaders have talked about democracy for the past 30 years, but done little. Rapid growth and the spread of the internet and mobile phones have enabled Chinese citizens to communicate, vent their grievances and pursue their dreams more freely than before, so long as they do not attack the party. But some are now demanding more say in how the country is run. In the past few weeks China’s more liberal newspapers have enthused about calls by the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, for “political reform”. Conservative newspapers have censored them. </p>\n<p>There is next to no chance of the cautious Mr Hu bringing in big reforms before he steps down. This week’s communiqué hailed the “political advantages of China’s socialist system” and mentioned political reform only briefly, saying—as Chinese leaders so often do—that it will require “vigorous yet steady” effort. Even Mr Wen, who will step down at the same time as Mr Hu, has wanted to move at glacial speed.</p>\n<p><a name=\"expect_paranoia_and_you_may_be_pleasantly_surprised\"></a><br><strong>Expect paranoia and you may be pleasantly surprised</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Might Mr Xi speed things up? There is no shortage of conservatives arguing for caution, but there is also a pragmatic argument for change: China’s economic gains could be jeopardised by a failure to loosen the party’s hold. Explosions of public discontent, fuelled by resentment of government callousness towards ordinary citizens, are becoming increasingly common in villages, towns and cities across the country. The (admittedly patchy) official data show a more than tenfold increase in the annual number of large protests and disturbances since 1993, with more than 90,000 cases reported in each of the past four years. In the past China’s leaders have relied on growth to secure social stability. If and when a more serious slowdown strikes, popular grumbles could increase. </p>\n<p>The right path for Mr Xi should be clear: relax the party’s grip on dissent, lift its shroud of secrecy and make vital economic reforms. But the rest of the world would be unwise to assume that reason will prevail. In times of uncertainty, the regime is wont to appeal to nationalist sentiment. Large anti-Japanese protests erupted during the latest party meeting. America and the West have also been subjected to tongue-lashings. The party meeting called on officials to strengthen “the country’s comprehensive national power”. </p>\n<p>Too many Westerners, including those urging trade sanctions over the yuan, assume that they are dealing with a self-confident, rational power that has come of age. Think instead of a paranoid, introspective imperial court, already struggling to keep up with its subjects and now embarking on a slightly awkward succession—and you may be less disappointed. </p>","rubric":"A crown prince is anointed in a vast kingdom facing vaster stresses.

But over the past decade its significance has hugely increased. For Turkey has gone through two big, and not always widely recognised, transformations: in its economic performance and in its foreign policy.</p>\n<p>For most of the post-war years the Turkish economy was, to reuse Tsar Nicholas I’s 19th-century phrase, “the sick man of Europe”, plagued by erratic growth, soaring inflation and periodic banking busts. Today inflation is far lower, the banks are solid and Turkey boasts the fastest-growing economy in the OECD club of rich countries. Because it is resource-poor, this growth reflects fundamental strengths, especially in manufacturing and construction. Turkey makes things like furniture, cars, cement (it is the world’s biggest exporter), shoes, televisions and DVD players. In a sense, it is Europe’s BRIC: it might be called the China of Europe.</p>\n<p>On foreign policy this long-standing member of NATO, with an army second in size only to America’s, has always been a bulwark of the West. Turkey and Norway were the only NATO members to border the Soviet Union. But Turkey’s pro-Western stance led it to neglect its neighbourhood, including many countries once in the Ottoman empire. Here, too, there has been a transformation. Backed by its strong economy, Turkey has become highly active in its diplomacy across the Middle East, in the Balkans and as far afield as Africa—and not always to the satisfaction of its allies. In a sense, Turkey has become a local diplomatic giant—the Brazil of the region.</p>\n  <p>You might imagine that Western powers would welcome such an advance. Instead, a more prosperous, bumptious Turkey is jangling many nerves. Europeans are trembling over the prospect of being asked to admit such a populous state into the European Union. The United States, which used to scold the Europeans for their reluctance, is uncomfortable with Turkey’s newly adventurous foreign policy. Critics in the West are prone to hide behind the idea that Turkey is drifting towards Muslim fundamentalism and somehow “being lost” by the West. This judgment is completely wrong; yet the more that people in the West persist in making it, the greater the chance that they may genuinely lose Turkey.</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_perils_of_democracy\"></a><br><strong>The perils of democracy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In foreign policy, the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has certainly fallen prey on occasion to excessive Muslim solidarity. It has been too nice to Sudan’s ghastly president, Omar al-Bashir, ignoring his indictment for war crimes. It made a mistake by joining Brazil in an ill-fated Iranian nuclear initiative that led to the embarrassing sight of Turkey, a member of the UN Security Council in 2009-10, voting against tougher sanctions on Iran. And its increasingly strident attacks on its once-close ally, Israel, have angered not only the Israelis but also many Americans, especially after the Turkish-led flotilla that tried to “relieve” the siege of Gaza this summer.</p>\n<p>But wait a moment. Brazil was nice to Iran, without anyone doubting its Western credentials. On Israel, Mr Erdogan has certainly at times played to the Arab street. But many of Turkey’s complaints, such as over settlement-building in the West Bank, are hardly controversial. It may have been ill-judged for the government to have been involved with those who launched the Gaza flotilla, but this would not have turned into such a catastrophe had the Israelis not killed nine people on board the leading ship. More fundamentally, the Turkish government is doing what democracies tend to do: reflecting its people’s views. Many Muslims think the Palestinians have been ill-treated. From an Israeli viewpoint it is no doubt awkward to have its human-rights record questioned by an elected prime minister, rather than by the usual Arab dictators. But who would America rather hear as a Muslim voice? The autocrats in Egypt and Saudi Arabia? The clerics in Iran? </p>\n<p>The Europeans are also in a funk—over Turkey’s possible membership of the EU. Negotiations have formally been going on for over five years. No country that has begun such talks has ever failed to be offered membership. But the leaders of France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands seem dead set against Turkish entry, as is much of their public opinion. The unresolved Cyprus dispute seems a near-insuperable roadblock. Yet if the EU chooses to exclude its own China, it will be turning away the fastest-growing economy in its neighbourhood. It will also lose any hope of influencing the region to its east. At a time when many Europeans fret about being ignored in the world, this would be an historic mistake. </p>\n<p><a name=\"how_western_are_they\"></a><br><strong>How Western are they?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The common excuse for these follies is the claim that Turkey is not really Western—and is becoming ever less so. Once again, Mr Erdogan has done some unhelpful things. Critics note that, ever since his mildly Islamist Justice and Development (AK) party came to power in 2002, it has been engaged in a battle with the Kemalist secular establishment. He is intolerant of dissent, shown in his battles with critical media commentators. And he is increasingly impatient with the EU.</p>\n<p>Yet fears of Turkey turning into the next Iran are absurd. A new tolerance of the headscarf in universities does not imply a sudden lurch into stoning adulteresses. Mr Erdogan’s run-ins with his opponents have certainly created a polarised society; he should adopt a more conciliatory tone if he wins re-election next June. But his opponents in the media still write their critical columns. It is troublemakers in the army who have posed a greater threat to democracy in recent times.</p>\n<p>In short, Turkey is heading in a good direction. It remains a shining (and rare) example in the Muslim world of a vibrant democracy with the rule of law and a thriving free-market economy.

But an election that had seemed a soporific canter has suddenly turned into a horse race. Having failed to win outright on October 3rd, Ms Rousseff, the former chief of staff and chosen candidate of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the hugely popular outgoing president, faces a run-off against Mr Serra on October 31st. Several recent polls put the gap between them at only five or six points (see <a href=\"/node/17309097\">article</a>).</p>\n<p>Mr Serra is lucky to have a second chance, for his campaign has until recently been hapless. He owes his reprieve mainly to the unexpectedly strong vote for a third candidate, Marina Silva, who won 19.3% on October 3rd. Less happily, religious leaders may have swayed some voters against Ms Rousseff, who once backed abortion rights. Ms Rousseff may still be the favourite to win, but Mr Serra has a spring in his step and the election is wide open. Brazil now has a choice.</p>\n<p>That is a good thing in itself. Ms Rousseff did not deserve to win by default just because she was Lula’s hand-picked successor. Which candidate deserves the presidency more? Both might be described as social democrats; both agree on the broad outlines of economic and social policy. Neither presages disaster for Brazil. That said, on the issues on which they disagree, Mr Serra is the more persuasive of the two.</p>\n      \n  <p>Ms Rousseff and the ruling Workers’ Party (PT) want the state to play a bigger role in the economy. They are especially keen on that in the oil industry, but they also want to keep lending public money to big business to create national champions. In return, in some cases, they want more influence over boardroom decisions. It is hard to see them putting a stop to the inexorable growth of the public payroll, swollen by many PT appointees, and of the tax burden required to pay for it.</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_case_for_change_at_the_top\"></a><br><strong>The case for change at the top</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mr Serra also has faults, notably a worrying tendency to try to micromanage everything. But his record suggests that he would move faster to cut wasteful spending and eliminate the fiscal deficit, and that he would be keener to mobilise private capital for much-needed infrastructure. Monetary policy would no longer have to carry all the burden of keeping inflation under control, allowing Brazil’s egregiously high interest rates to fall (and helping to halt the excessive appreciation of the real). Ms Rousseff would tackle such distortions more gradually, if at all. In an uncertain world that is unnecessarily risky. For all his achievements in fighting poverty and making Brazil a fairer place, Lula is bequeathing a country where one in two homes lack mains sewerage and educational standards remain woeful. Those should be priorities for public spending. </p>\n<p>There are two other reasons why Brazilians would do well to favour Mr Serra. The first is that Ms Rousseff is not Lula. She lacks his extraordinary political gifts and perhaps also his innate pragmatism. By contrast, although Mr Serra may be a poor campaigner, he has been an effective minister, mayor and governor. Second, although no political party has a monopoly when it comes to corruption, there are plenty of signs that the PT has become too cosy with power. After eight years under the PT Brazil would benefit from a change at the top.</p>","rubric":"In a suddenly exciting contest, José Serra would be a better president than Dilma Rousseff","id":"17309001"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Leaders","headline":"Home truths","title":"America's property market","content":"<p>AMERICA’S mortgage lenders are again at the centre of a scandal. This time the cause is not the recklessness of their lending, but the sloppiness with which they are dealing with the resulting defaults. Recent revelations suggest that many lenders rode roughshod over legal niceties to push delinquent borrowers out of their homes. Although banks claim the irregularities are minor, “Foreclosuregate” risks becoming a quagmire. Prosecutors across the country have launched investigations. Many politicians (though to his credit not Barack Obama) have called for a moratorium on repossessions. </p>\n<p>None of this will help America’s moribund housing market. Tying the process of repossession in yet more knots will make it harder for the market to clear and for house prices to find a floor. Ideally, politicians ought to speed up foreclosure, which in some states can take up to two years. Moving somebody out of his home quickly may sound heartless; but stretching the process out is a bad idea. Would you bother to look after a property you were due to be expelled from? </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, few politicians are likely to champion faster repossessions. And even if they were to, the scale of America’s mortgage mess would still be daunting. Around 2.5m homes are in the process of repossession, and 11m (or nearly 25% of all homes with mortgages) are “underwater”: borrowers owe more on their mortgage than their houses are worth. Since it is hard for such people to move home, this not only causes misery, but also clogs up America’s labour market.</p>\n      \n  <p> Both lenders and the overall economy would be better off if more delinquent mortgages were restructured rather than foreclosed. The Obama administration, like George Bush’s team before it, has tried schemes to encourage lenders to keep people in their homes by reducing their monthly mortgage payments. But these have not worked well, mainly because reducing payments does little to prevent default when houses are worth a lot less than the outstanding debt. </p>\n<p>A better route would be to reduce the mortgage principal, giving borrowers a bigger incentive to pay their debt. Even though they know this would probably mean they would one day get more money back, banks dislike this. If you let one person off paying what he owes, then surely his neighbour will want the same? Also, many homes have several claims or “liens” on them, which complicate any debt reduction. And lenders fear lawsuits from mortgage bondholders if they start writing down loan values. These are reasonable worries. How might government encourage a better outcome?</p>\n<p>One extreme is to bribe banks into action with big subsidies: but that would require a lot more public money which voters are not inclined to provide. The other is to force the banks’ hand, for instance, by changing the bankruptcy code to allow judges to restructure mortgages in the same way as other loans. It might indeed make sense to change the law for future mortgages, but rewriting loan terms retrospectively tramples on existing contracts and property rights, and should not be done lightly (see <a href=\"/node/17305544\">article</a>). </p>\n<p><a name=\"a_matter_of_principal\"></a><br><strong>A matter of principal</strong>\n</p>\n<p> So the best bet is a series of more moderate options to nudge lenders in the right direction. Regulators should force banks to write down the value of second liens, which are often held at vastly inflated values on their balance-sheets. Existing subsidies for preventing foreclosure should be redirected towards reducing principal. Congress could shield banks from lawsuits that arise from a mortgage reduction, and offer favourable tax treatment to “shared appreciation” mortgages, where lenders share in the gains if houses subsequently rise in value.</p>\n<p>Even these changes would be politically difficult. But, paradoxically, Foreclosuregate may actually help. By shining a spotlight on the scale of the mortgage mess, it also opens an opportunity for a fresh start. </p>","rubric":"Preventing foreclosures won’t fix America’s housing mess.

Policymakers and even some businesses have started to express a view of nature as a store of wealth—or “natural capital”. Talk of “ecosystem services” now draws attention to the helpful things that nature does unbidden, such as providing fresh soil and clean water.</p>\n<p>This approach not only has the advantage of moving conservation from the domain of lofty morality down to earth, reflecting a pragmatism more likely to support and sustain action. It also serves to highlight the interests of the people who have most to gain from the recognition of natural capital’s value, and the most to lose by its squandering: poor people living close to nature in the developing world. </p>\n<p>Another welcome development is that there have been conservation successes. Political enlightenment and an economic boom have led to great progress in the Amazon rainforest, with Brazil’s deforestation plummeting. Indonesia’s rate has also dropped. The possibility of halting global deforestation has become a plausible and thus worthwhile goal. </p>\n  <p><a name=\"unconventional_wisdom\"></a><br><strong>Unconventional wisdom</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All this good stuff, however, has little to do with the CBD, the 193 parties to which began one of their two-yearly meetings this week in Nagoya (America is not one of them, having not ratified the convention). The changed language of conservation owes little to the well-intentioned work of the CBD. Progress on forestry has come about largely through national efforts, helped by lower demand for commodities and reinforced by bilateral agreements to do with climate change.</p>\n<p>And the global perspective that the CBD has some claim to representing can be overblown. The ecosystem services that matter at a global level are, for the most part, those to do with climate, and are covered in deals on deforestation. Most of the time ecosystem services and natural capital are specific to a particular area, country or region, and that is the level where they ought to be supported. Donor countries, banks and consortia promoting new financial models for conservation can provide ever more such support. The CBD is in a position to encourage experiment, but not much more. </p>\n<p>The convention’s achievements, such as they are, are much more marginal. The only protocol drawn up under its remit, in Cartagena in 2003, seeks to avert damage by genetically modified organisms; not a front-rank threat. The convention’s strategy for plant conservation has yet to deliver the first of its aims (a list of the world’s plants). It is now working on a way for developing countries to share in profits made from organisms and genes that originate in their territories, and this could conceivably tidy up a messy area in which negotiators at the World Trade Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation are also active. But any protocol that can be agreed upon is unlikely to alter current practice in the area much. </p>\n<p>Should the CBD be scrapped? It is tempting to say yes when it comes up with overblown, unobtainable targets, such as stopping all extinctions anywhere, or when it entertains foolish proposals, like the current Luddite idea to restrict all forms of research exploring the possibility of “geoengineering” the climate. But when it sticks to achievable, measurable targets, such as increasing the area of nature reserves in the ocean, it can provide a useful focus. And an occasional talking shop is useful for donors to compare projects and see which work best. As conservationists like to say, every niche is valuable.

Something electrifyingly important yet ominous was happening: George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, was setting out the results of the coalition government’s spending review, elucidating how it intends to cut Britain’s huge fiscal deficit—currently equivalent to 10% of GDP. His statement in Parliament was only, as Winston Churchill might have put it, the end of the beginning of the long process of hacking back Britain’s overgrown state. Nevertheless, it was a crucial indicator of the direction in which the government, and with it the apprehensive country, are travelling. It is basically the right one—with important provisos. </p>\n<p>The spending review raised three big and related questions. First, do Mr Osborne’s sums add up? Second, has the government cut Britain’s public spending in the right way and in the right places? Finally, do its individual decisions amount to a persuasive vision of a redesigned British state?</p>\n<p><a name=\"george_pulls_it_off\"></a><br><strong>George pulls it off</strong>\n</p>      \n  <p>The answer to the first question is broadly yes—in the sense both of elementary maths and economic wisdom (see <a href=\"/node/17316567\">article</a>). It may seem unremarkable that Mr Osborne has specified the spending-reduction programme to match the fiscal goals he set out in his budget in June. Since then, he has found additional savings in the welfare budget, so that the cuts to government departments—19% on average between now and 2015—are slightly less severe than previously advertised. But given the scale of the spending squeeze (the most sustained in Britain in living memory), and the complexion of the government (a coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who until recently had wildly different views about public spending), it is quietly impressive that Mr Osborne, and David Cameron, the prime minister, have pulled it off. </p>\n<p>On balance, Mr Osborne is still right that the economic risks of not decisively tackling the deficit outweigh the risk of doing so. All the same, the government’s bet that the private sector will generate growth as the public sector retrenches remains just that: a gamble. If there are clear signs of economic confidence declining or growth stalling, it should respond—not by easing the spending cuts Mr Osborne outlined, but by deferring some of the tax rises the government is also planning.</p>\n<p>Many of the government’s specific decisions are sensible too. It was right not to slash the defence budget to the point where the country’s ability to project power would have been permanently crippled (though it is somewhat odd that Britain will temporarily find itself in possession of a new aircraft-carrier but without the planes to put on it—see <a href=\"/node/17316591\">article</a>). Mr Osborne was also right to protect capital spending as far as possible: despite its economic value, such investment is often the first thing that myopic cost-cutting governments sacrifice. </p>\n<p>Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne have, however, persisted in at least one fallacy. Before the general election in May, the Tories pledged to protect the National Health Service from cuts. The aim was to reassure the voters that they were not heartless toffs. That decision was mistaken: the NHS budget grew extravagantly under the previous Labour government and was as ripe as any for pruning. The Tories have wriggled out of other pre-election commitments, citing the exigencies of either the country’s fiscal plight or the coalition; they should have done the same with this one, which, given that health accounts for nearly a fifth of government spending, would have eased the pressure on other parts of the budget. </p>\n<p><a name=\"every_crisis_an_opportunity\"></a><br><strong>Every crisis an opportunity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The answer to the final question is mixed. Mr Osborne stressed that, along with the government’s mantra of “fairness”, reform was a guiding principle of the review. And there were some further signs that the government is intent on designing a more effective state, as well as a leaner one. He emphasised the coalition’s enthusiasm for outsourcing publicly funded services and gave the country’s emasculated local councils more authority over their budgets (while also slashing them). A big cut to the Ministry of Justice’s funding will be accompanied by more emphasis on preventing prisoners reoffending rather than merely banging more of them up: a good example of how the state should aim to do “more with less”.</p>\n<p>The government is admirably determined to cajole some of the 5m adults who subsist on state benefit in Britain into work. On the other hand, perhaps because of the ruckus caused by his withdrawal of child benefit from high earners, Mr Osborne shied away from further attacks on the principle of universalism in the welfare system: he might, for example, have targeted the costly perks dispensed to pensioners regardless of their wealth. This may prove a political mistake, as it will bolster the arguments of those who point out that the poor are set to be squeezed most harshly. But it is wrong in principle too. </p>\n<p>Under the previous Labour government, the state became more of a comfort blanket than a safety net: it took on jobs and commitments that are not properly its business. Handing out money to rich pensioners is one of them. Even after Mr Osborne’s savagery the state will still consume in 2014-15 the same share of GDP—41%—as it did in 2007-08. And, despite occasional attempts to devolve power in line with Mr Cameron’s “Big Society”, the state will still fundamentally be the same shape, trying to do virtually all the same things.</p>\n<p>The other big proviso is that now the government actually has to make the cuts, not just talk about them. The public has been assiduously softened up for fiscal pain; the reality may not be quite as bad as some fear. Nevertheless, the measures Mr Osborne described will result in almost half a million jobs being cut from the state payroll. Millions of people will see their welfare payments shrink; the pension age will rise more quickly than the previous government intended; train fares and university tuition fees will jump. There will be opposition and outrage—not just from leftish unionists and Scottish nationalists but also from the Tories’ natural supporters such as the police (whose numbers are being cut) and middle-class parents. The real battle starts now. </p>","rubric":"George Osborne’s austerity programme is justified, but the government should be bolder in redesigning the British state","id":"17309087"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Letters","headline":"On far-right politicians, guns in America, child benefit, electric cars, swearing, cleanliness","title":"Letters","content":"<p>\n<a name=\"europe%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s_far_right\"></a><br><strong>Europe’s far right </strong>\n</p>\n<p>SIR – Charlemagne was right (“<a href=\"/node/17200240\">A false prophet</a>”, October 9th) to argue that Geert Wilders’ position of having one foot in and one foot out of government through offering external support allows him to gain policy concessions while not assuming full cabinet responsibility.

Though he was criticised in many newspapers, he appears to have the support of the people. Following the announcement, a poll by YouGov tested support for the principle of cutting child benefit for households where someone earns over £44,000, the threshold for higher rate income tax. Eighty-three percent of people said they supported the policy, with only 15% opposed. The British public intuitively understands the absurdity of raising taxes to pay welfare benefits to the well-off.</p>\n<p>Michael Davies<br>London </p>\n<p>SIR – Taxation ought to be based on an individual’s ability to pay, which is a result not only of a person’s income, but also other factors, chief among them the number of dependents they need to provide for. In many countries the tax code provides for tax allowances for dependent children and/or transferable tax allowances between married couples. If George Osborne has his way, Britain will have a tax system where an individual earning £45,000 with dependent children and a non-working partner will pay exactly the same amount of tax as a single, childless person with the same income. Furthermore, the hard threshold envisaged at the moment will mean that a person with children earning £44,000 will take home significantly less money if he gets a modest pay rise.

If Britain is to reach its 2020 carbon-reduction targets, it is vital it acts now. With this in mind, I cannot see the sense in the argument that because the national energy supply is not yet entirely renewable, action on electric vehicles should be delayed. When the process of changing the way our electricity is produced is completed, it would be rather backwards if vehicles were still entirely dependent on oil and gas.

It is true electric-vehicle subsidies are an expensive CO2-abatement measure and investing in renewable energy generation sounds more cost-efficient. However, renewable-energy output is usually intermittent and therefore relies on some sort of energy storage. This is where an indirect advantage of electric vehicles comes into play. They could provide a distributed storage resource to balance the volatility of renewable energy.</p>\n<p>Marina Gonzalez<br>Zurich</p>\n<p>SIR – Your article left out an irony. Environmentalists generally object to battery-powered devices and for good reason: batteries require mined minerals, employ manufacturing processes that leak toxins into local ecosystems and leave behind an even-worse trail of side effects upon disposal.

This rather ignores the possibility of urbanites occasionally hiring a heavy-duty petrol car to satisfy this and other 1% requirements while their own electric vehicle looks after the vast majority of other journeys. An added benefit of this combination of electric-car ownership and petrol top-up hire would be the more efficient utilisation of larger, and generally more environmentally damaging, petrol vehicles that currently litter suburban residential areas and quietly decompose between their brief school-run and supermarket duties.</p>\n<p>Paul Bullen<br>London</p>\n<p><a name=\"foul_language\"></a><br><strong>Foul language </strong>\n</p>\n<p>SIR – Am I right in thinking that you are becoming more prudish?

The Netherlands’ recently elected minority government depends for survival on support from a Muslim-baiting populist. Economies across Europe are struggling to cope with sluggish growth, lacerating budget cuts and the after-effects of borrowing binges. But there is an exception to the gloomy European rule.</p>\n<p>No big developed country has come out of the global recession looking stronger than Germany has. The economy minister, Rainer Brüderle, boasts of an “XL upswing”. Exports are booming and unemployment is expected to fall to levels last seen in the early 1990s. The government is a stable, though sometimes fractious, coalition of three mainstream parties. The shrillest protest is aimed at a huge new railway project in Stuttgart. Amid the truculence and turmoil around it, Germany appears an oasis of tranquillity.</p>\n<p>To many of its friends and neighbours, though, the paragon is a disappointment. Its sharp-elbowed behaviour during the near-collapse of the euro earlier this year heightened concerns about Germany’s role in the world that have been stirring ever since unification 20 years ago. Speeches, seminars and scholarly articles by nervous Germans and Germany-watchers are a booming cottage industry. A recent essay published by Bruegel, a Brussels think-tank, explains “why Germany fell out of love with Europe”. Another, from the European Council on Foreign Relations, alleges that Germany is “going global alone”. Jürgen Habermas, Germany’s most distinguished living philosopher, accuses his country of pursuing an “inward-looking national policy”. “How can you not ask Germany questions about its vision of the future of Europe?” wonders Jacques Delors, who was president of the European Commission when the Berlin Wall fell. Even a pacific and prosperous Germany causes international angst. </p>\n      \n  <p>The German question never dies. Instead, like a flu virus, it mutates. On the eve of unification some European leaders worried that it would resume killer form. “We’ve beaten the Germans twice and now they’re back,” said Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s prime minister. Such fears now look comical. But even today’s mild strain causes aches and pains, which afflict different regions in different ways. America’s symptoms are mild. Central Europe seems to have acquired immunity. After unification 85% of Poles looked upon Germany as a threat, recalls Eugeniusz Smolar of the Centre for International Relations in Warsaw. Now just a fifth do. It is among Germany’s long-standing west and south European partners that the German question feels debilitating, and where a dangerous flare-up still seems a possibility. Germany’s answer to the question matters not only to them. It will shape Europe, and therefore the world. </p>\n<p>Germans have not forgotten that their country was the author of the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s but, says Renate Kocher of Allensbach, a polling firm, they want to “draw a line under the past”. That does not mean ignoring its lessons or neglecting to teach them to the next generation. A new exhibition on “Hitler and the Germans” at the German Historical Museum in Berlin is drawing blockbuster crowds. But Germans are no longer so ready to be put on the moral defensive or to view the Nazi era as the defining episode of their past. Even non-Germans seem willing to move on. Recent books like “Germania” and “The German Genius” suggest that English-language publishing may be entering a post-swastika phase. Germany still atones but now also preaches, usually on the evils of debt, the importance of nurturing industry and the superiority of long-term thinking in enterprise. Others are disposed to listen. “Everyone orients himself towards Germany,” says John Kornblum, a former American ambassador.</p>\n<p><a name=\"the_worries_below\"></a><br><strong>The worries below</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yet this buoyancy is checked by equally potent anxieties. Germany’s bestselling book is “Deutschland schafft such ab” (“Germany does away with itself”), a warning by a director of the Bundesbank, since forced out of his job, that too much child-bearing by the poor and by immigrants (especially Muslims), and too little by the educated classes, dooms the country to decline. The book’s popularity has shaken Germany. Xenophobic parties play little role in politics, but the resentments that feed their popularity elsewhere are just as potent. A third of Germans think the country is overrun by foreigners, according to a newly published poll; a majority favour “sharply restricting” Muslim religious practice. Over a tenth would even welcome a <em>Führer</em> who would govern with “a strong hand”—a sign that the embers of extremism still glow. </p>\n<p>Conservative politicians, long fearful of being outflanked on the right, are pandering. Horst Seehofer, head of the Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), declared this month that Germany needs no further immigration from Turkey or the Arab world. Germany is “not an immigration country”, he insisted, contradicting a hard-won consensus among conservatives. Characteristically, Angela Merkel, the CDU chancellor, sought to placate anti-immigrant sentiment without stooping to populism. Multiculturalism has “absolutely failed”, she said on October 16th, implying that immigrants would be expected to integrate better into German society. But she balanced this by admitting that Islam “is part of Germany”. </p>\n<p>Despite their economic strength, Germans fear the worst. They believe their country “has passed its zenith”, says Mrs Kocher, the pollster. This pessimism shapes Germany’s dealings with the rest of the world. Unlike most countries, Germany is not driven by any great ambition, but rather by the fear that “things could fall apart if they don’t hold on to stability,” suggests Mr Kornblum. </p>\n\n<p>This year’s euro crisis brought out both the apprehension and the arrogance. With Greece’s near default, the promise that the euro would be as stable as the Deutschmark suddenly looked like the lie Germans had always suspected it to be. As the crisis mounted Mrs Merkel delayed giving German backing to the inevitable rescue for wobbly euro countries. A €750 billion ($920 billion) package was eventually agreed on after a hectic weekend of negotiation in May. To Germans, this looked like the start of the dreaded “transfer union”, a bottomless commitment to subsidise Greeks’ early retirement, fix an Italian budget tattered by tax evasion and clear up after Spain’s burst property bubble. “Sell your islands, you bankrupt Greeks. And the Acropolis while you’re at it,” demanded <em>Bild</em>, a popular tabloid. Mrs Merkel played to the gallery by suggesting that persistent euro sinners should be thrown out of the group.</p>\n<p>These unEuropean outbursts startled not just Greeks, who brandished swastikas in response, but Europeans generally. They had grown up believing that the Germans saw their own interests as inseparable from those of their fellow Europeans. Now they glimpsed a different, ugly German, smug about his economy and untroubled by his past. Some pundits argue that Germany’s brutality to Greece during the second world war should have tempered its irritation with the Greeks.</p>\n\n<p>The crisis has created a new pecking order, at least temporarily. Germany, with its high-competitiveness, low-debt economy, is on top. The rest are having to adjust, including France, traditionally a joint leader of the European project. This is unsettling. “You get an enormous sense of German self-righteousness, which is very difficult to take, especially when there are solid foundations for it,” says François Heisbourg of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. France, which has lagged behind Germany in making structural reforms, feels its influence waning. “France has to do its homework to be able to restore some level of influence in Europe,” says Jean-Pierre Jouyet, a former French minister for Europe, now head of France’s financial regulatory authority.</p>\n<p><a name=\"whatever_became_of_gem%C3%A3%C2%BCtlichkeit\"></a><br><strong>Whatever became of Gemütlichkeit?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Even during the golden age of European integration Germany was an awkward partner, too big to be first among equals but too small to dominate, as Helmut Kohl, the chancellor who unified Germany, put it. It never lost sight of its own interests. As early as 1960 France and Germany clashed over the founding of Europe’s common agricultural policy. France regarded the Deutschmark as an instrument of economic terror, forcing it either to shadow the Bundesbank’s monetary policy or to devalue the franc. But long before the euro arrived in 1999, the German finance minister of the day, Theo Waigel, vowed it would bear “the German hallmark”. </p>\n<p>Still, the tone changed under Mr Kohl’s successor, Gerhard Schröder, who headed a coalition of Social Democrats and Greens from 1998 to 2005. He was unembarrassed to flex Germany’s newly acquired muscles and to employ the sort of language heard from leaders of more nakedly nationalistic countries. He accused Brussels of “blowing” taxpayers’ money. He made his quarrel with the United States over the Iraq war the centrepiece of his 2002 campaign for re-election—an unprecedented affront to Germany’s most important ally. With Vladimir Putin’s Russia, Mr Schröder was poodle-like. The two men agreed to build an undersea gas pipeline from Russia to Germany bypassing central Europe and the Baltic states, which Poles denounced as a second Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. </p>\n<p>After Mr Schröder’s pugnacity, Mrs Merkel’s consensual style looked like a return to German form. She was instrumental in ensuring passage of the Lisbon treaty, which is supposed to help the EU cope with its expansion to 27 members and creates machinery for an EU foreign policy. She repaired relations with Germany’s eastern neighbours, reassured the United States and pandered less to Russia.</p>\n<p>As a Euro-builder, she soon showed, she is not in Mr Kohl’s class. During economic crises her first instinct has been to double the guard around the German treasury. She backed the appointment of relative lightweights for both the EU presidency and the foreign minister’s job created by the Lisbon treaty.</p>\n<p>“Under Merkel, Germany is no longer an actor that supports supranational development,” says Hans Stark of the French Institute for International Relations. The assumption now, he says, is that individual governments, not the European collective, will remain the principal actors “and Germany has adapted to that.” Germany’s brightest business prospects do not involve its slow-growing neighbours but the charismatic economies of Asia and Latin America. A German acceptance of Turkish membership of the EU looks less likely than ever.</p>\n<p>Relations between Germany and France, traditionally the twin motors driving European integration, are volatile. The methodical Mrs Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, the impulsive French president, are not natural partners. He recently quoted Mrs Merkel as saying that Germany was about to put in place a policy of expelling gypsies just like France’s, which drew a sharp denial from the chancellery. When previous German chancellors and French presidents clicked, their relationship “cascaded down to other levels”, says Mr Heisbourg, the strategist. “That is totally lacking today.” Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy manage to resolve crises as they threaten to spin out of control. But Franco-German ambitions for Europe have sputtered. German standoffishness toward the EU is now based in law: a 2009 ruling by Germany’s Constitutional Court allowed it to ratify the Lisbon treaty but limited further transfers of power to Brussels. Soon the court may weigh in on the euro-zone bail-out. </p>\n<p>Such omens suggest that the Berlin republic is a different sort of character from its westward-leaning, Bonn-based predecessor. Scholars had struck several awkward coinages to describe war-chastened Germany: it was a “tamed power” engaged in “attritional multilateralism”. These no longer seem apt for today’s more confident and self-willed Germany. But its identity is still unformed. Germany has “instincts sometimes rather than a clearly articulated policy”, says a senior EU official. An American diplomat believes it is still “trying to decide what its foreign policy in the 21st century should look like”. Germany is becoming more “normal”, meaning more willing to use its strength and to accept responsibilities that go along with it. That looks to America like a good thing. But can Europe afford a more normal Germany?</p>\n<p><a name=\"europe_wants_some_nice_leadership...\"></a><br><strong>Europe wants some nice leadership...</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Germany’s most pressing European business is to sort out the euro, the foundation on which the European edifice now rests. Euro members promised to observe financial disciplines, which many soon flouted (including Germany, which let its budget deficit breach 3% of GDP). That, says Germany, must never happen again. In September the European Commission proposed German-inspired rules that would limit “macroeconomic imbalances” such as excessive current-account deficits, in addition to budget deficits and public debt. Rule-breakers would face sanctions. </p>\n<p>The reform of the euro will create a more German Europe, but not quite the economic Pax Germanica some observers are expecting. “We need German discipline,” says Sylvie Goulard, a French member of the European Parliament, “but without growth it will be more difficult to make this discipline acceptable.” On October 18th Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy struck a deal that would weaken the sanctions regime proposed by the commission (by letting heads of government decide whether to impose them). In return, France agreed to support a debt-restructuring procedure demanded by Germany (see <a href=\"/node/17307985\">Charlemagne</a>). In Brussels that caused dismay. The Franco-German axis looked stronger. But German discipline, and the role of European institutions in enforcing it, were weakened.</p>\n<p>German leadership is more apparent in other areas. It has assets available to none of the other big euro members, including unparalleled trade links to rising powers (nearly half the EU’s exports to China come from Germany) and a leader who is taken seriously by her counterparts (David Cameron is respected, but Britain does not count). Germany is claiming leading positions in EU institutions: Uwe Corsepius, Mrs Merkel’s European adviser, will become secretary-general of the European Council. Axel Weber, now head of the Bundesbank, is favoured to become the next president of the European Central Bank. In European deliberations, Germany often sets the tone. Not until the Germans concluded that the Pakistani floods were really grave did the EU take action (by extending trade concessions). They may well take the lead in deciding whether to recognise China as a market economy in applying international trade standards. </p>\n<p>But, despite such examples of leadership, Germany’s overall direction is obscure. It is torn, intrigued by its new possibilities but painfully aware that alone it does not count for much in the world. Its population is already shrinking. Europe will lose economic and demographic bulk relative to China, India and Brazil. The EU was virtually ignored at last year’s Copenhagen summit on climate change, even though it had taken the lead in setting targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. This was “an enormous shock”, says Guy Verhofstadt, a former Belgian prime minister who now leads the liberals in the European Parliament. “It shows we need one voice.” Fear of war launched the European project; he hopes that fear of irrelevance will drive it forward. </p>\n<p>Some quarters of the German establishment nod in agreement. Pressed for Germany’s vision of Europe, Werner Hoyer, an aide to the foreign minister, says it is to secure Europe’s “success in a globalised world”. That means “deepening economic integration”, dismantling remaining barriers to the single market and dealing with other powers through Brussels, not national capitals. “It is in our interest to convince them that the gateway to Europe is European institutions,” says Mr Hoyer. He thinks Europe must “globalise its foreign policy if we don’t want to be bystanders”. Whether the prosaic chancellor shares these ambitions is unclear. She is a pilot who does not believe in making announcements from the flight deck. </p>\n<p>And so Germany’s partners are likely to remain on edge. The EU needs Germany’s leadership more than ever, but fears its pre-eminence. Europe also needs consensus, but will not get it unless the Germans foster it. Matters will be even worse if Germany’s economic self-confidence comes across as political arrogance.</p>\n<p><a name=\"america_would_rather_see_it_stand_tall\"></a><br><strong>America would rather see it stand tall</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Obama administration views Germany’s rise not with consternation but with impatience. “Germany is emerging as a much more active world player, which is a good thing,” says an American diplomat. The latest sign of that is the success of Germany’s campaign this month to win a temporary seat on the UN Security Council, the first time it has challenged rival contenders. It has lately been an active ally to the United States, pressing Serbia to accept Kosovo’s independence and toughening sanctions imposed on Iran. And Germany’s dealings with Russia arouse less suspicion under Mrs Merkel than they did when Mr Schröder was chancellor. At a triangular meeting in the French resort of Deauville this week, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy persuaded Russia’s president, Dmitry Medvedev, to attend NATO’s forthcoming summit and to consider joining a European missile-defence shield.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in military terms, Germany remains a midget compared not just with America but with Britain and France, which together account for 70% of the EU’s military research and development and 60% of its deployable forces. “What’s missing is Germany leading rather than seeing what Paris and London cook up,” says a NATO diplomat. Its military deployments in Afghanistan and elsewhere are recent and unpopular. Its body of strategic thinkers is small. Germany’s trading relationships bring influence, but also inhibit its willingness to join allies to fight global threats.</p>\n<p>America and Europe are seeking slightly different answers to questions posed by Germany’s growing strength. Americans, says the diplomat, hope for “an outward-looking Germany” that is less “conflicted about its weight in the world”. Europeans, for their part, look to Germany for leadership, but want it to be tempered by traditional German self-restraint. In the eyes of its allies there are still two Germanys. It may have to learn to be both. </p>","rubric":"Its economy is booming, but its strength poses new questions","id":"17305755"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"States' fights","title":"The mid-terms","content":"<p>IF THE amount spent on an election campaign is any measure of its significance, then the three most important races in the mid-term elections are for governorships—those of California, Florida and Texas. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks fund-raising for state-level races, the candidates for governor in California alone have raised almost $170m, not counting spending by third parties trying to influence the outcome. The tally for the most expensive congressional race, in contrast, is a mere $32m, for Florida's open Senate seat.</p>\n<p>The battle for Congress tends to dominate mid-term election coverage, especially in years like this one, when control of both chambers is in doubt. But on November 2nd American voters, in addition to choosing a fresh batch of representatives and senators, will award 37 governorships and 6,118 seats in state legislatures, along with many other state and local offices.</p>\n\n<p>Those races are just as finely balanced as the congressional ones: 23 legislative chambers are within five seats of changing hands, while RealClearPolitics, a website, currently projects that 19 governorships will switch from one party to the other. This upheaval, Republican and Democratic strategists agree, will continue to shape national politics long after the two-year term of the next Congress has ended.</p>\n  <p>The governors and state legislatures elected next month will determine how states overcome the gaping shortfall in revenue most face in the coming years. In the process they are likely to pioneer policies that will later be adopted at the national level. Many of the most successful reformers, in turn, will move on to federal offices, much as Barack Obama ascended from state senator to senator to president. In many states the new crop of legislators will also have a more immediate impact on national politics, first by redrawing congressional districts to account for shifts in population over the past ten years, and then by putting their successful electoral machinery at the disposal of their party's presidential candidate in 2012.</p>\n<p>In the states as at the national level, the outlook for Democrats is grim this year. The Republicans claim that they are poised to seize control of at least six legislative chambers from the Democrats, and possibly as many as 17. They are also projected to make a net gain of at least five governorships. In part, this will simply reverse the Democrats' success in recent elections, winning governorships or state legislatures in usually reliably Republican states such as Wyoming and Indiana.</p>\n\n<p>But it also reflects a swing against the Democrats in their heartland. In no fewer than 11 states that plumped for Mr Obama in 2008, Republicans hope to win over legislative chambers. They see the big industrial states bordering the Great Lakes as particularly promising territory: they are aiming for “red sweeps” in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, meaning control of both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship. All of those states were won by Mr Obama in 2008, and all of them are these days considered to be swing states in presidential elections, so the results there will doubtless be watched with particular fascination in the White House.</p>\n<p>It is not unremitting gloom for the Democrats, however. Their candidates for governor in California and Florida both hold narrow leads in the polls, despite the prodigality of their millionaire opponents. Other potential pick-ups include Hawaii, Minnesota and Connecticut. Some party activists see a chance of winning a majority in Texass House of Representatives, although Republicans insist that prospect is receding along with the hopes of the Democrats' candidate for governor, Bill White.</p>\n<p>Democrats would be particularly cheered by victories in Florida and Texas, as they would thereby earn a say in redistricting in two big and fast-growing states where congressional boundaries are currently drawn in Republicans' favour. By the same token, red sweeps in states that are likely to lose seats, such as Ohio and Michigan, would allow the Republicans to ensure that the burden falls squarely on Democratic incumbents. REDMAP, a Republican outfit that targets state-level races because of their significance for redistricting, reckons that the party could create as many as 25 additional safe Republican seats—including five in Ohio alone—if it wins control of the right legislatures and governorships. </p>\n<p>The main duty of the new legislatures and governors, however, will be to balance the states' budgets. Until now, the federal government's fiscal stimulus has helped to paper over states deficits with one-off handouts. But most of that will end next year, leaving states with an even bigger hole to fill than they have faced this year or last: $134 billion according to the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think-tank. Since almost all states are prohibited by law from running deficits, the result will be either drastic spending cuts or big tax increases. On the whole, Republicans favour spending cuts, whereas Democrats are more inclined to preserve services, even if it means higher taxes.</p>\n\n<p>Inevitably, the federal government will end up mimicking the policies of the states that cope best with such difficulties, one of the great strengths of a system in which 50 states are able to experiment and compete on policies. At any rate, that is what happened in the 1990s, when the feds adopted reforms to welfare benefits first tested in Wisconsin, and in the past decade, when it followed California's lead in overhauling car-emissions standards. Moreover, many of the most successful legislators and governors will move on to federal politics in time. Five of the past six presidents, for example, held state office earlier in their careers; four of them (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George Bush junior) had served as governor. By the same token, many candidates for the House of Representatives have previously served in state houses; many governors and senators have previously held other statewide offices such as attorney-general, secretary of state, lieutenant-governor and so forth. Local politics may be in thrall to national trends this year, but for much of the time, the reverse is true. </p>","rubric":"Elections for governorships and state legislatures could affect America as much as the more famous mid-term battle for Congress","id":"17309249"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"Strange meeting","title":"New York","content":"<p>A BROTHEL madam, an ex-Black Panther, a teamster and a self-styled “Papa Smurf” all got together for a debate on Long Island.

Oklahoma’s vote on whether courts should be banned from using <em>sharia </em>may well be the most puzzling, given that American jurisprudence is hardly at risk of Islamic infiltration and there are virtually no Muslims in Oklahoma. Others, in their sheer range, bespeak America’s diversity. Voters in South Dakota may ban all smoking of cigarettes in restaurants and bars on the very same day that Californians might completely legalise the smoking of joints.</p>\n<p> That latter measure, called Proposition 19, is certainly the most controversial of the lot. But several others could have effects just as far-reaching if they create bellwethers or test grounds for future policy in other states or Congress. This is especially true in three areas: energy and climate-change policy; taxation; and the workings of democracy itself.</p>\n<p>Since a federal cap-and-trade bill made it through the House but died in the Senate, energy and climate change have slipped down the list of national priorities. In California, however, they have not. In 2006 the state forged ahead with a pioneering law called AB32 under which Californians will have to make their cars, factories, houses and appliances gradually more efficient, so that the state reduces its greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Bipartisan majorities in the state legislature voted for it, and the outgoing governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, considers the law one of his main achievements. Proposition 23, however, now intends to kill it. Technically, it will merely “suspend” its implementation until the state unemployment level falls below 5.5% for a full year. But that is at best years away; California’s unemployment now tops 12%.</p>\n  <p> Proposition 23 has become bitterly controversial in part because of its supporters. The campaign has been funded by oil companies from other states, specifically two refiners from Texas and an energy conglomerate, Koch Industries, run by two billionaire brothers from Kansas who are also funding the tea-party movement. Their argument is that AB32 imposes unacceptable costs on firms such as theirs and might therefore force them to cut jobs, which is clearly anathema in this economy.</p>\n<p> This has led to fierce resistance, with the No campaign, co-chaired by a Republican stalwart of credibility, George Shultz. Ronald Reagan’s secretary of state has won the money war with donations from individuals and Silicon Valley. Everybody from its sponsors to its opponents regards Proposition 23 as a weather vane for subsequent energy politics elsewhere. Polls suggest that voters will reject it.</p>\n<p>As states and cities struggle with budget gaps and lower revenues, taxes are an even bigger issue than usual. Some states, such as Colorado and Indiana, have ballot measures that would cut or cap certain taxes. Others, like Oregon and Arizona, voted earlier this year to raise specific taxes.</p>\n<p> But voters in the state of Washington will make by far the most historic tax decision. Washington is one of seven states that have no personal income tax at all. Instead, it relies mostly on a sales tax. Past attempts to introduce a state income tax have failed, with one famous case in the 1930s even suggesting that such an income tax would violate the state constitution.</p>\n<p> The latest attempt is a measure called I-1098. It would introduce an income tax for the richest 1.2% of tax filers, with brackets that start at earnings of $200,000 for individuals or $400,000 for couples.</p>\n<p> The issue has split Washington’s elite. I-1098’s main sponsor is Bill Gates senior, father of America’s richest man, who also supports I-1098. But his friends at Microsoft are fighting for the other side, as are the bosses at other iconic firms in Seattle, such as Amazon and Nordstrom.</p>\n<p> The main argument for a state income tax on the rich is that it could save the state’s schools. Opponents counter that, once the tax exists, it will be easily extended to ensnare ever more taxpayers. Support for the measure has been shrinking to what is now a tight race.</p>\n<p><a name=\"votes_to_change_votes\"></a><br><strong>Votes to change votes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Three other measures in California, though cloaked in the bewildering complexity that the state seems to specialise in, go to the heart of effective democracy and may have wider implications. Two of them concern gerrymandering, the reprehensible practice by politicians of drawing nonsensical district boundaries to include supporters and exclude opponents.</p>\n<p> In 2008 Californians voted to establish an independent commission for mapping the districts of state legislators, a job those politicians had been doing themselves. This year Proposition 20 would extend that commission’s work to congressional districts. California’s Democratic Party is the main opponent, although its main argument—that legislators should continue to draw the boundaries because they are more “accountable”—is hard to deliver with a straight face.</p>\n<p> This being California, another initiative on the same ballot, Proposition 27, would in essence do the exact opposite, by abolishing the independent commission and returning all redistricting power to the state legislature. If the electorate is confused enough to pass both measures (such things have happened), the one with the greater number of Yes votes takes effect.</p>\n<p> Also on that California ballot is Proposition 25, which might have an immediate and dramatic effect in curing the state’s notorious political dysfunction. California is one of three states (with Arkansas and Rhode Island) that require supermajorities in both houses of the legislature to pass a budget, and it is the only state that simultaneously has the same requirement for raising taxes (which a dozen other states also have). The combination virtually guarantees gridlock; this year’s budget was 100 days late.</p>\n<p> Proposition 25 would reduce the requirement for budgets to a simple majority, but keep the supermajority rule for tax hikes. In effect, it would empower the ruling Democrats to set spending priorities (but with the same revenue pot), and thereby also hold them responsible for those decisions. If those politicians have to answer to un-gerrymandered districts, this is the way it should be. </p>","rubric":"Besides electing politicians, voters will decide 155 state policies directly","id":"17312240"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"Suspennsylvania","title":"Pat Toomey v Joe Sestak","content":"<p>ONLY a few days ago, Joe Sestak, a congressman and former three-star admiral who is vying to become Pennsylvania’s next senator, looked fated to be a courageous loser. He is the mutineer who brushed aside a job offer from the White House and defied the Democratic establishment to wrest the nomination from Arlen Specter, the Republican who had defected to the Democrats in 2009. But in the fight against Pat Toomey, his Republican rival, Mr Sestak has been trailing badly. As little as a week ago, the polls, on average, put the Democrat 7% behind.</p>\n<p>By October 20th, however, the morning before the first televised debate between the candidates, two new polls suddenly put Mr Sestak narrowly ahead for the first time. This has been seized on in the Democratic campaign as evidence that a shrewd decision to husband resources during the summer and make a late advertising splurge at the end is bearing fruit. The debate itself was an ill-tempered affair, with the two men branding each other as extremists and clashing on everything from guns to abortion to government bail-outs.</p>\n<p>Before this week’s poll news, the different mood inside the two campaigns was as palpable as the gap in the numbers. In a converted doctors’ office, next door to Ice Cream World, in a drab shopping strip outside Allentown, Mark Harris, Mr Toomey’s campaign manager, exuded confidence.

In Pittsburgh, too, the Republicans claim to be making inroads in districts where unions once turned out reliable Democratic voters but where many union jobs have now vanished. </p>\n<p>From the start, says Mr Harris, Mr Toomey has focused on jobs and the deficit. He claims the Republicans’ voting pool has been swollen by independent voters and ex-Democrats who are “outraged by what is going on in Washington”. The Democrats have responded by talking up their own man’s naval background—he commanded a battle group in the Middle East—and painting Mr Toomey, an unapologetic economic conservative and former president of the pro-business Club for Growth, as a creature of Wall Street. The Republican did work there, but it was in the 1980s, before he set up a restaurant business and served three terms in Congress. </p>\n<p>If Mr Sestak does hold the Keystone State for the Democrats, the former admiral could sink what little chance the Republicans had of winning the Senate as well as the House.

The meeting was supposed to be held in Arizona but governors on the Mexican side took umbrage at that state’s recent and controversial law that cracks down on illegal immigrants. So New Mexico hosted the event instead.</p>\n<p> The conference was watched closely in New Mexico’s 2nd congressional district, which stretches from the suburbs of Albuquerque to the Mexican border. In Las Cruces, the 2nd district’s biggest town, the press was still absorbing the details of the latest grisly murders in Juárez, just 45 miles away over the border. </p>\n<p>Although the drugs violence is virtually all on the Mexican side, border issues are a big concern for New Mexico’s voters at the mid-terms. A poll in the <em>Albuquerque Journal</em> in September found strong opposition in the state to a law giving drivers’ licences to illegal immigrants. Nor is the worry limited to Anglos. Around half of New Mexico’s population (and of the 2nd district’s) is Hispanic; 67% of them object to the law (though they also object to Arizona’s crackdown by 48%-39%). </p>\n  <p>Steve Pearce is the Republican candidate in the 2nd. He recognises the “emotional” resonance of the border issue, though he stresses that job security is currently of far more importance to the electorate. Mr Pearce held the seat between 2002 and 2008 (he ran for senator that year, losing to Mark Udall). He would put more resources into securing the border, which he says affects all the district’s communities, and opposes any sort of worker “amnesty”, though he does not support a policy of rounding up illegal immigrants, whom he thinks should be treated humanely. Harry Teague, who won the seat for the Democrats in 2008, backs the proposed DREAM bill in Congress that would allow illegal immigrants who come to America as youngsters and are of good “moral character” to become residents. </p>\n<p>Another issue in the district is energy and the stalled cap-and-trade bill, which Mr Teague supported but only after protections were added for small oil refineries. The oil and gas industry dominates the south-east corner of the district. The drive from Hobbs to Artesia passes along miles of nodding pumpjacks; oil trucks clog the road, and the air is heavy with the industrial odour of the refineries. Mr Pearce is a target for green groups, who accuse him of favouring “big oil”. He has studied the arguments for alternative energy and thinks environmentalists are ignoring the pragmatic aspects of the policies they push for. He does foresee some role for wind and solar power; but voters will not stand for higher utility bills and uncertain supply. Mr Pearce is not too bothered by the attacks on him by greens, pointing out that if they were that effective he wouldn’t have been elected to three terms previously. </p>\n<p>The race is tight. A recent poll for the <em>Hill</em>, a newspaper about Congress, put Mr Pearce at 46% and Mr Teague at 42%. As this is one of many contests where the Republican is ahead but polling under 50%, the paper wondered whether the electoral tsunami often mentioned as likely to sweep the Democrats from power in the House might turn out to be only a ripple. </p>","rubric":"The economy dominates the campaign, but people also worry about the border","id":"17312310"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"After tobacco","title":"Biotechnology in North Carolina","content":"<p>FOR much of the early 20th century, Winston-Salem was the biggest city in North Carolina.

But that was long before Hanes began moving much of its production offshore, and before the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (under which the tobacco companies agreed in 1998 to pay hundreds of billions of dollars in damages for harming people’s health), the leveraged buy-out of RJR by a private-equity firm, the elimination of federal farm price support for tobacco and decades of anti-smoking advertising. </p>\n<p>Today tobacco warehouses and factories still dominate Winston-Salem’s centre. The Bailey Power Plant’s twin redbrick chimneys emblazoned with “RJR TOB CO” loom over the interstate. But the plant no longer belongs to RJR, and it is no longer involved in producing tobacco: it was turned over to the Piedmont Triad Research Park last April, along with 38 acres (15 hectares) of property and a cash donation of $2m. In all, 14 buildings in the science park, representing around 1.3m square feet (121,000 square metres) of space, once belonged to RJR.</p>\n<p>Tobacco’s legacy to Winston-Salem is far from being merely architectural. Because it has been such an important cash crop for so long, it is among the most studied plants in the world—Richard Reich, the assistant commissioner for agricultural services in North Carolina’s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, calls it “the laboratory white rat” of the plant world. Much of that study, of course, was done by tobacco companies, and Targacept, one of the bioscience companies in the Piedmont Triad Research Park, is among the fruits of that labour. Spun out from RJR in 2000, and headed by J. Donald deBethizy, a former vice-president of R&amp;D at RJR, Targacept is developing a range of drugs that target the body’s nicotinic receptors to treat a range of nervous-system disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s.</p>\n  <p>East of Winston-Salem at a research park in Durham, a Canadian company that genetically manipulates tobacco plants to produce proteins used in making flu vaccines broke ground on its first American facility on October 1st. Medicago hopes to have its vaccines on the market by late 2013; the company believes this method of making vaccines will be cheaper, faster and more effective than the egg-based method currently in use. </p>\n<p>In 2009 North Carolina farmers raised 177,400 acres of tobacco with a production value of just over $745m, making it the leading tobacco producer among American states; but the crop is nowhere near as widely cultivated or as valuable as it once was, though agriculture remains important, providing 18% of the state’s income. The hope is that biotech will help fill the hole. The North Carolina Biotechnology Centre, a government-sponsored body working to grow the state’s biotech industry, has a plan to increase the state’s agriculture sector by $30 billion over the next decade. Meanwhile Kentucky Bioprocessing, a biotech company based in another tobacco-producing state, is pursuing research similar to Medicago’s. The future of tobacco may not all go up in smoke. </p>","rubric":"North Carolina builds on the legacy of the golden leaf","id":"17312274"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"False expectations","title":"Infrastructure spending","content":"<p>DEMOCRATS, Republicans chant, are irresponsible big spenders. But in the run-up to the mid-terms, the Democrats ought to have had one example of spending at its best: investment in infrastructure. When they passed the $787 billion stimulus bill in February 2009, they promised an historic investment in roads, bridges and rail. It would put Americans to work quickly and raise productivity in the long term, a Keynesian kick with benefits for years to come. But this ambitious plan has had middling results. Infrastructure is still in need of investment; unemployment in the construction sector was 17.2% in September. Barack Obama is touting a new $50 billion infrastructure proposal, but as the mid-terms loom, it is probably too late. </p>\n<p>The stimulus bill’s spending on infrastructure may have been doomed to mediocrity from the start. First, and most important, a relatively small share of the bill was actually devoted to infrastructure. Mr Obama called the bill “the largest new investment in our nation’s infrastructure since Eisenhower built an interstate highway system in the 1950s.” But even on the broadest definition of the term, infrastructure got $150 billion, under a fifth of the total. Just $64 billion, or 8% of the total, went to roads, public transport, rail, bridges, aviation and wastewater systems.</p>\n<p>Second, hopes for an immediate jolt of activity were misplaced. The bill prioritised “shovel-ready” plans. States did have a backlog of maintenance projects, such as repaving dilapidated roads. Nevertheless, work moved more slowly than some Democrats expected. By October 2009 even the fastest programmes—those under the highway and transit headings—had seen work begin on just $14.3 billion-worth of projects. Spending has since quickened. Of the money appropriated to transport, 83% has now been allocated. But it is unclear that the money spent has been money spent well. The attempt to begin work hastily meant that both good and bad projects have moved forward. </p>\n  <p>Meanwhile the bill’s most notable project, high-speed passenger rail, threatens to become a debacle. It is fun to imagine trains whizzing across the heartland. But there is no urgent need for them. Freight companies worry that new passenger services will simply increase congestion. Any new rail service, meanwhile, is unlikely to be particularly fast. The Recovery Act dedicated $8 billion for high-speed trains, a sizeable sum but not enough for any train that is actually high-speed. Instead of being a selling point for Democrats, rail has become an easy target for Republicans. In Ohio, the Republican nominee for governor declares: “when I’m governor, the 39-mile-an-hour high-speed passenger train is dead.” Wisconsin’s Republican nominee even started a website, Notrain.com. </p>\n<p>Mr Obama’s new $50 billion infrastructure plan has promising elements, such as a proposal for a national infrastructure bank. But his push may be for naught: Americans have become allergic to spending. Politicians are unlikely to rise the gas (petrol) tax to pay for it. Janet Kavinoky, transport director for the Chamber of Commerce, is one of many advocates who want a long-term transport bill. The trouble is, she reckons, that most people think the stimulus bill took care of all that. </p>","rubric":"The historic infrastructure investment that wasn’t","id":"17311851"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"The librarian's tale","title":"Free internet","content":"<p>USUALLY by ten in the morning at the Erna Fergusson public library in Albuquerque a dozen people are waiting in line to use the computers. Shortly after the doors opened on a weekday this summer there was someone typing at every screen. Two young girls dressed an online doll together; next to them a man in a Dallas Cowboys cap applied for a job at a hardware chain. He’s living with his parents for a while, he explained, and he doesn’t like to wait to use the internet.</p>\n<p> Almost all of America’s public libraries provide free internet access. Over the past two years, hard-hit Americans have been economising by cancelling their broadband contracts at home and looking to public libraries to fill the gap. At the same time, companies and government agencies are saving money by moving job applications and services online; so a rush of new visitors is arriving at libraries just as the local governments that fund them run out of money. </p>\n<p>This year three-quarters of America’s public libraries have told the American Library Association that public use of the internet increased at their branches, and roughly the same number said that they didn’t have enough computers to meet demand. A majority of American states have cut funding to their libraries during the year.</p>\n  <p>The weak economy is forcing libraries to redefine their role. Close to 70% of America’s public libraries now say their staff help patrons complete job applications online, and the same number offer help with résumés. “Workforce Solutions”—as the state of New Mexico calls the dole—requires a weekly check-in. For many people, long queues or long journeys means it is only practical to do this online. Lynne Fothergill, a head librarian at Erna Fergusson, says she noticed an increasing number of online check-ins in early 2009; they are now a primary function of the library’s two 15-minute computer terminals.</p>\n<p> Nationally, the number of libraries reporting that they help patrons with e-government services has risen by almost half. As with private employers, when state and local governments save money by moving services online, they actually shift some of those costs to the point of access: for many of those most likely to need jobs and benefits, this is the local library.</p>\n<p> Perversely, computers are often more expensive for public libraries than for individuals, and harder to buy. In Albuquerque, any city purchase over $500 requires approval by a technical review committee. A single library desktop, with all of the officially necessary licences and security and session-management programmes, costs the city a whopping $1,800.</p>\n<p>The best way for America to ease the new strain on its libraries is by closing the digital divide; companies and state agencies are unlikely ever to give up the efficiencies they won by moving online. Around $7 billion of 2009’s stimulus went to expand broadband access. But encouraging competition among America’s expensive broadband providers, and hence lower prices for consumers, might do this more cheaply than subsidies. </p>","rubric":"Too much demand for too few terminals","id":"17311861"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"United States","headline":"Trouble with the humans","title":"Lexington","content":"<p>ONE of Barack Obama’s political problems, a popular quip has it, is that the remote, dispassionate and professorial president is just “not very good with the humans”. To that it might be added that he does not go down at all well with one sort of human in particular: the white working-class American. </p>\n<p>Across the country, Democratic candidates know that victory in the imminent mid-term elections requires them not only to unhitch themselves from Mr Obama’s waning star but also to attack whole chunks of the president’s agenda. This may not be the obvious way for a political party to present itself for re-election, but at the level of individual races it makes sense. In 2008 many Democrats floated into Congress in Mr Obama’s slipstream. Today he has become an albatross around their necks. His own job-approval rating has slumped below 50%. But it is lower than that among whites and lower still among working-class whites. </p>\n<p>If the white working class has a capital, says Henry Olsen of the American Enterprise Institute, it is West Virginia, where more than nine out of ten people are white and six out of ten have never gone to college. For more than half a century, the Mountain State sent the late Robert Byrd, a Democrat, to represent it in the Senate. Now the state’s popular governor, Joe Manchin, also a Democrat, is hoping to take his place. But this year everything is different. Despite Mr Manchin’s relentless efforts to distance himself from that fellow in the White House, the race is a toss-up. </p>\n  <p>No other state is quite like this: in the electorate as a whole, the white working class adds up to perhaps 40% of the voters. But at a time when most working-class white voters are furious at the Democrats, the states where these voters are concentrated have become a happy hunting ground for Republicans. Mr Olsen thinks it no coincidence that a disproportionate number of the Democrats’ most vulnerable House seats in the South, the north-east and the Midwest are in districts dominated by blue-collar whites. Democrats are struggling in the bellwether state of Ohio, and may lose the tight Senate races not only in West Virginia but also in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The revolt of this class, he thinks, could be the defining characteristic of the election, counting more even than the rise of the (also mostly white, but mostly more affluent) tea-party movement.</p>\n<p> White working-class voters are the quicksilver of American politics: they are hard to catch and hard to hold. The shifting loyalties of these “Reagan Democrats” (so called because the Gipper detached them from the Democrats in the 1980s, until the wiles of Bill Clinton wrested some of them back a decade later) have helped to swing American elections for decades. Their votes will matter less in the future, as their educational attainment rises and their share of the electorate continues to fall. Minority voters, who cast a mere 14% of votes in 1994, cast more than a quarter of them in 2008, and this share will grow. So plenty of Democratic forecasters from the demography-is-destiny school argue that in the long run the Republicans are doomed unless they can win over more blacks and Hispanics. </p>\n<p>Between now and the long run, however, come the mid-terms. And the prospect of a Democratic rout prompts an inevitable question. Have such voters turned on the Democrats because Mr Obama is black? His election was hailed as proof that America had moved beyond race. And yet voting in the mid-terms will be polarised by race. Most whites will pull the Republican lever. Almost all blacks and most Hispanics will vote Democrat. </p>\n<p>Race was a factor in 2008, and still is. Why else would blacks alone have stuck so staunchly by their man? As for working-class whites, they did not much care for Mr Obama even in 2008, preferring John McCain by a margin of 18%. But as Mr Obama campaigned, his colour seemed to count for less. </p>\n<p>For 20 years Stan Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, studied the blue-collar white voters of Macomb County near Detroit. In 1984 they voted by two to one for Ronald Reagan because, Mr Greenberg found, when such voters heard Democrats talk about economic “fairness”, they saw this as code for transferring money to blacks. Nonetheless, in 2008 Mr Obama won Macomb County with a margin of eight points. Over the course of his campaign, the proportion of Macomb voters who said they were “comfortable” with the idea of Mr Obama as president rose from 40% to 60%. Having watched Mr Obama closely, Mr Greenberg concluded, they “became confident he would work for all Americans and be the steady leader the times required.”</p>\n<p><a name=\"colour_me_fickle\"></a><br><strong>Colour me fickle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If such voters have now changed their minds, the reason is not that Mr Obama is black—he was black in 2008. And for all its momentous symbolism, his election is not the most recent evidence that America has turned the page on race. In June, in South Carolina of all states, Tim Scott, a black Republican, defeated the son of the segregationist Strom Thurmond in a primary, and is on his way to a seat in the House. Compare that to 1983, when a disgraceful number of Democrats in Chicago voted for the Republican rather than send the black Harold Washington to city hall. </p>\n<p>All of that has gone. The electorate may be divided by race, but no longer mainly because of race. Some of Mr Obama’s enemies have tried to harness pockets of bigotry by painting him in various ways as un-American. But outright racism in politics is now beyond the pale and will probably have little to do with the coming rejection of the Democrats by the white working class. A wrecked economy and the feeling that their president is out of touch are reason enough. It has, after all, happened before. In two short years from 1992 to 1994, when Bill Clinton was president, white working-class support for the Republicans soared like a rocket from 47% to 61%. Nobody blamed that on skin colour. </p>\n\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"Working-class whites are angry with the Democrats for lots of reasons.

On October 3rd the candidate of the centrist opposition Party of Brazilian Social Democracy (PSDB) got 33% of the vote, well behind the 47% won by Dilma Rousseff of the left-wing ruling Workers’ Party (PT). The pair will face each other in a run-off on October 31st. Although recent polls differ widely, some say that Ms Rousseff’s lead has shrunk to only five or six points.</p>\n<p>That gap barely exceeds the polls’ margin of error. And since Ms Rousseff fell short of forecasts that she would win an outright majority in the first round, Serra optimists are wondering if the pollsters are overestimating her support once again. A race whose outcome had seemed certain since June, when Ms Rousseff passed Mr Serra in the polls, now looks exciting.</p>\n<p>In the two candidates’ debates since October 3rd, an energised Mr Serra has landed some telling blows. A few weeks ago Ms Rousseff stumbled when some religious leaders criticised her former support for liberalising Brazil’s strict abortion laws. Wary of alienating a conservative electorate, she backtracked, first saying that she “personally” opposed the procedure and then pledging that as president she would not move to ease access to abortion. That allowed Mr Serra to describe her as incoherent and two-faced. Her alleged lack of ballast also features in his campaign ads, which show the candidates as Russian dolls. His opens to a recital of his record as congressman, senator, health minister, and mayor and then governor of São Paulo, revealing doll after doll. Hers is empty.</p>\n  <p>Ms Rousseff’s main riposte is borrowed from Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, her mentor and the current president. In 2006 he beat the PSDB’s Geraldo Alckmin, in part by portraying him as pro-privatisation (which is almost as unpopular in Brazil as being pro-choice). Mr Alckmin had trouble responding to the charge. But Mr Serra countered by accusing Ms Rousseff of electioneering and robotically obeying her strategists. This time, it was Ms Rousseff who was left without a comeback.</p>\n<p>The scent of victory, however faint, has fired up Mr Serra’s allies. Few PSDB candidates mentioned him in their campaigns for Congress or governorships, on the basis that reminding voters of links with the weaker presidential contender would be damaging. But both São Paulo and Minas Gerais, Brazil’s two most populous states, elected PSDB governors this year. The winners, Mr Alckmin and Antônio Anastasia, are trying to deliver their voters to Mr Serra. In Minas Gerais 6.3m people voted for Mr Anastasia, 3m more than Mr Serra got there—a big pool of potential swing voters.</p>\n<p>The PSDB also hopes to woo the 20m Brazilians who voted for a third candidate, Marina Silva of the Green Party. On October 17th she and her party said they would make no endorsement in the run-off, despite offers from both sides of policies and posts in return. Recent polls suggest that, with the Greens staying neutral, Mr Serra will win a majority of Ms Silva’s votes.</p>\n<p>Attempts to predict the result are complicated by worries about the reliability of polls. It is hard to construct a representative sample in a country as large, diverse and unequal as Brazil. Pollsters may also have failed to predict a run-off because they did not ask whether respondents intended to vote. In theory, that question is irrelevant in Brazil, since voting is compulsory. In practice, however, around a fifth of the electorate stays away.</p>\n<p>And abortion, until recently an electoral problem only for Ms Rousseff, is now a wild card. On October 16th some newspapers picked up claims by former students of Mr Serra’s wife that she had mentioned having had an abortion herself. This gossip-mongering was swiftly denied by Mr Serra’s team. But it led him to steer clear of the subject in the following day’s debate. How it plays on internet forums and in evangelical sermons is anyone’s guess.</p>\n<p>All this uncertainty has engendered two competing political narratives. In one, the polls are overstating Ms Rousseff’s lead. She has gained all she can from Lula’s support, and it was not enough. Exposed as an un-Christian flip-flopper and shorn of the momentum that came from seeming inevitability, she will see her voters melt away. Meanwhile the PSDB’s grandees will swing big states to Mr Serra, where they will be joined by most of Ms Silva’s voters.</p>\n<p>The other view is that Ms Rousseff has wobbled only because Lula stepped back to let her take the limelight. Now that he has corrected his mistake and returned to her side, her support will tick up again. And the polls, far from being wrong before the vote, were a better guide to public opinion than was the result itself. Because of the plethora of candidates and posts, many confused voters may have spoilt or mis-cast their ballots. That will not happen in the run-off, with just two presidential candidates and fewer other races. </p>\n<p>Even if Mr Serra is at last making a persuasive case, overturning a 14-point lead in just four weeks would be like performing a handbrake turn in a ten-tonne truck. Which version is closer to reality will be known only once the votes are counted.</p>","rubric":"In the race to beat Dilma Rousseff, José Serra has hit his stride at last.

Yet it was engineers from Codelco who stood beside him this month as the 33 miners trapped since August 5th in the privately owned San José copper and gold mine in northern Chile were hoisted to safety.</p>\n<p>Other big mining companies helped with advice and equipment. But Mr Piñera looked to Codelco, which runs the world’s biggest underground copper mine in El Teniente, to lead the rescue operation. Perched 2,500 metres up in the Andes south of Santiago, El Teniente is a far cry from the dark, crumbling warren of the San José mine. Its 2,400km (1,500 miles) of galleries, with their computer-equipped offices and canteens wafting the smell of food into the surprisingly fresh air, are meticulously organised and home to some of the world’s most advanced underground mining technology.</p>\n<p>Codelco’s foundations were laid in 1971, when Salvador Allende, a socialist president, nationalised Chile’s American-owned mines. Although General Augusto Pinochet toppled Allende in a coup two years later and then instituted free-market reforms, the dictator did not reprivatise the mines. Instead he merged them into a single state-owned enterprise, and required it to hand over 10% of its export revenues to the armed forces. Today, Codelco still mines over a tenth of the world’s copper, but it has seen its share of Chile’s output dwindle from 75% in 1990 to 32% last year.</p>\n  <p>For the past decade, its production has been stuck at around 1.6m tonnes (although it reached 1.8m tonnes last year), while more expensive inputs and overstaffing have pushed up costs. Its stagnation is largely the fault of past governments that, eager for tax revenues, short-changed the company’s investment budget. It has not stood still—a new mine, Gabriela Mistral, opened in 2008—but nor has it spent enough to maintain production at its ageing mines beyond 2013. El Teniente urgently needs to expand to a deeper level. Chuquicamata, an open-pit mine in the north, must go underground to stay viable.</p>\n<p>“We need to create a new Codelco,” Mr Piñera told <em>The Economist</em>. “It needs funds, new organisation and new management.” He favours its partial listing on the stockmarket, but has accepted that changing the constitution to allow this is politically impossible. Instead, his government will seek to push through other changes.</p>\n<p>Reform of Codelco’s governance began last year (as a condition of Chile joining the OECD, a club of mainly rich countries). Its board now has more independence from the government; the directors recruited Diego Hernández, a former manager at BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining company, as the new chief executive. His priority is to implement a proposed five-year $15 billion investment plan, including a new mine and the expansion of El Teniente and Chuquicamata. This should raise output to 2.1m tonnes by 2018.</p>\n<p>Some of this capital can be borrowed. Most analysts think that Codelco can safely double its $4.7 billion debt burden. Mr Piñera says that Codelco can enter joint ventures with private companies to develop some of its copper reserves, which are a third of the country’s total. The firm also has non-mining assets (such as a stake in an electricity firm) that could be sold. The government plans to let Codelco retain more of its profits (including the money it hands over to the military). Earlier this year Mr Piñera rebuffed Codelco’s request to keep 30% of its 2009 profits of $4.1 billion, on the grounds that the money was needed for reconstruction after the earthquake in February. But it is likely to get its way over its 2010 profits, provided it accepts further reforms to boost efficiency.</p>\n<p>With the price of copper back near record highs after crashing in 2008, the private sector is poised to boost investment, too. According to the Capital Goods Corporation, a business group in Santiago, private mining firms could invest as much as $21 billion in Chile over the next five years, mainly in copper and gold projects.</p>\n<p>On October 13th, just as the miners were being winched up to the surface at San José, Chile’s Congress approved a government proposal to raise royalties paid by mining companies, from 4-5% today to as high as 14%, to help pay for post-earthquake reconstruction. The new rates will be phased in, and in return the government will extend the life of tax-stability agreements with the companies. The mining lobby has grumbled. But the firms are unlikely to stop investing. Although the San José mine has now closed, the future of big mining in Chile looks bright. </p>","rubric":"After rescuing the miners, the state copper giant has other work to do","id":"17311933"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"The Americas","headline":"Shooting the messenger","title":"Media freedom in Latin America","content":"<p>REPORTERS are notorious for shrugging off danger to get a good story. So when <em>El Diario</em>, a newspaper in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juárez, ran a front-page editorial last month asking for guidelines from drug gangs as to what it should censor, journalists around the world were shocked. Calling the city’s mobs “the de facto authorities in this city”, the article pleaded: “Gentlemen…please explain to us…what you would like us to publish or stop publishing…because the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots.” Three days earlier, a trainee photographer at the paper had been murdered.</p>\n<p>With democracy having replaced dictatorship everywhere bar Cuba in Latin America, the region’s media face few of the menaces of the past, such as censorship or the army kidnapping, torturing and murdering journalists. But in several countries the media are finding that freedom from state repression does not mean they can publish what they please. “Coming out of dictatorships and the cold war, we expected more respect for civil and human rights,” says Alejandro Aguirre of the Inter-American Press Association, an industry body. “But things have got worse. There’s a new wave of restrictions on the media.”</p>\n<p>The biggest threat now comes from organised crime, whose attacks against journalists often have the aim of inducing self-censorship. Mexico has become especially dangerous. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a New York-based organisation, at least 37 media workers have been killed or gone missing in Mexico since 2006. Most of the crimes have taken place along key drug-trafficking routes.</p>\n  <p>Mexico’s mafias have become surprisingly media-conscious. In February two gangs, the Gulf “cartel” and the Zetas, imposed a joint “news blackout” as they fought each other to control Reynosa, on the Texas border. Eight reporters who disobeyed were kidnapped (at least three are confirmed dead). Because the media refused to cover the battle, the mayor’s office issued updates on Twitter, a micro-blogging service. Other gangs have tried to use journalists to their advantage. In July some reporters from Televisa, Mexico’s biggest television network, were kidnapped. They were freed after another channel agreed to broadcast a video accusing the government of aiding a rival gang.</p>\n<p>In Colombia the press suffered similar perils in the past, especially in remote towns. According to the CPJ, 51 journalists were killed in Colombia from 1997 to 2003. This fell to just 11 between 2004 and 2010. </p>\n<p>Whereas Colombia has got safer, Central America has become more dangerous. In Honduras eight journalists have been killed this year. Some of the victims opposed a coup in 2009—a new government was elected in November—or backed peasant land-reform movements. Others were reporting on drug traffickers. At least one was accused by colleagues of trying to extort money by threatening negative coverage. None of the cases has been solved.</p>\n<p>The second big threat to the media comes from governments. With the notable exception of the post-coup regime in Honduras last year, the principal offenders have been populist, left-wing elected leaders. When media outlets oppose such rulers they often face harassment. </p>\n<p>Hugo Chávez has closed a Venezuelan television network, 32 radio stations and two local television channels by refusing to renew their licences. Gustavo Azócar, a journalist who criticised one of Mr Chávez’s political allies, was jailed for eight months on dubious charges. Guillermo Zuloaga, the owner of an opposition television network, fled the country after a judge ordered him to be sent to a violent prison to await trial on charges relating to his business dealings. And media workers handing out leaflets calling for freedom of the press last year were beaten by assailants who were never punished.</p>\n<p>In Ecuador, the government of Rafael Correa has increased its grip on the media. It now controls some 20 media companies, including two television stations seized from fugitive bankers. Mr Correa’s supporters included in the new constitution a measure to ban banks from owning media. A planned government bill would place further curbs on the media. During a police mutiny last month all television and radio stations were required to broadcast only government-supplied information. </p>\n<p>Argentina’s ruling couple, President Cristina Fernández and her husband and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner, are trying to dismantle the Clarín Group, the country’s biggest media conglomerate, after its coverage of them turned negative in 2008. Their tactics have included sending tax agents to raid its offices; enticing Argentina’s football league to break its contract with a Clarín-owned cable channel; cancelling the company’s licence to provide internet service; and trying to increase state control of the country’s sole newsprint producer. They also won passage of a law in 2009 that would force Clarín to divest key assets within a year, although the courts have blocked enforcement of the deadline. Separately, they have increased the government’s advertising budget from $16m in 2003 to $223m last year, enabling them to “buy” friendly coverage from media that depend on those revenues.</p>\n<p>Bolivia’s government recently passed a law allowing it to close media that publish content it deems racist. Daniel Ortega, Nicaragua’s president, had a critical journalist charged with money laundering, and freed two prisoners who had killed reporters. </p>\n<p>There is merit to these governments’ complaint that a few private hands control too much of the media. Yet all too often their remedies seem aimed at preserving that power—and shifting it to the state. </p>","rubric":"Threats from criminals and governments","id":"17311905"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"The Americas","headline":"One taco too many","title":"Obesity in Mexico","content":"<p>SEVENTY metres (230 feet) long and slathered with cream and cheese, the world’s biggest enchilada was cooked up in a suburb of Mexico City on October 17th.

In 2000 some 20% of Mexican primary-school girls were overweight; by 2006 27% were. Diabetes is the top cause of hospital admission after childbirth, and the second-biggest cause of death.</p>\n  <p>Enchiladas and other greasy national dishes are partly to blame. But foreign junk-food is piling on more pounds. McDonald’s fries over 8,000 tonnes of potato a year in Mexico. The worst offender, according to Antonio Villa Romero of the medical faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, is a plague of <em>refrescos</em>, or fizzy drinks. Sedentary lifestyles also contribute: Mexican schools lack playing-fields, and teachers say the crowded timetable (often with two shifts a day) leaves no room for sport.</p>\n<p>The government has launched a national slimming campaign, led by an army of 535 trainers who are drilling a five-point exercise and healthy-eating plan into state education officials. Within five years, says Cuauhtémoc Mancha, who runs the programme, “we hope to see a new generation that drinks water rather than <em>refrescos</em> and prefers fresh meals to industrial food.”</p>\n<p>But sticking to a diet is hard. In May the government trumpeted a ban on junk food in schools following an April visit by Michelle Obama. Yet pressure from food companies has led to a “minimal” blacklist, allowing the continued sale of cakes and <em>refrescos</em>, says Dr Villa Romero. The government must face down the junk merchants and limit food ads during children’s television programmes, he says. If not, Mexicans only need to look north to see what awaits them.</p>","rubric":"Time for a national diet","id":"17314636"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Asia","headline":"Xi who must be obeyed","title":"China's next leader","content":"<p>IN ORDER to be taken seriously, sometimes “thumping the table is better than not thumping”, Xi Jinping reportedly said when he was a relatively little known provincial chief. On October 18th Mr Xi, who is now vice-president, was anointed as China’s leader-in-waiting. Yet earning the respect of his fractious Communist Party, let alone a sceptical public, will require a lot more than table-bashing. Mr Xi’s eventual grip on power is by no means assured. </p>\n<p>For years China’s Communist Party has mulled over the idea of allowing a modicum of open competition for its top job. But on October 18th the party leadership made clear that this time its succession arrangements would leave nothing to chance. At a secretive meeting it appointed Vice-President Xi Jinping to a senior military post. In the party’s coded language this means he will begin taking over as China’s leader in two years’ time. </p>\n<p>It had long been assumed that Mr Xi, who is 57, would get the top job, and that this would be signalled by making him vice-chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission. President Hu Jintao was given the same job in 1999, three years before he took over as party chief. Last year, however, with three years to go before Mr Hu’s expected move towards retirement and no announcement on Mr Xi, some had begun to wonder whether the party might be preparing a different way of transferring power. When the party’s 370-strong Central Committee began a four-day annual meeting at a heavily guarded Beijing hotel on October 15th, it was far from certain that Mr Xi was about to be anointed. But the party has stuck to tradition. The commission, it tersely said, would be “augmented” by the inclusion of Mr Xi. </p>\n  <p>This adds little to Mr Xi’s power (the armed forces will remain under Mr Hu and his generals). But it clearly signals that the party believes that Mr Xi should replace Mr Hu as general secretary in late 2012. Mr Hu is not obliged to step aside then. But since 1993 the position of party chief has gone hand-in-hand with that of president. Mr Hu is required to step down as president in March 2013. There is no rule saying when he must step down as military chief. But precedent suggests he will also hand this role to Mr Xi by 2014. </p>\n<p>Mr Xi cannot afford to relax. His grooming may look similar to that undergone by Mr Hu before he began taking over in 2002, but there are crucial differences. For one thing, Mr Hu’s appointment was decided not by his predecessor, Jiang Zemin, but by Deng Xiaoping, the political giant of the post-Mao era, who died in 1997. Such was Mr Deng’s authority that even five years after his death Mr Hu remained firmly on track to replace Mr Jiang. Mr Xi’s career path, by contrast, was decided by the far less imposing Mr Hu, with input from the now retired and doddery Mr Jiang. The transfer of power to Mr Hu was the first smooth succession in communist China’s history. The handover to Mr Xi may not be the second. </p>\n<p>Mr Hu also had longer to brace himself, having joined the Politburo’s Standing Committee—the handful of people who run China—a decade before his elevation. Mr Xi will have had only five years there by 2012. Mr Hu impressed Deng in the 1980s with his toughness as a party chief in rebellious Tibet. Mr Xi might seem to have had a cushier career, as leader of two rich coastal regions—the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang—with seven months in 2007 as party chief of Shanghai.</p>\n<p>Mr Xi’s family background will also be a mixed blessing. He is the son of the late Xi Zhongxun, a veteran of the party’s early days and a senior official under Deng who was purged during the Cultural Revolution. This makes him a member of what the Chinese sometimes call the “princeling party”, a loose-knit group composed of the offspring of the communist era’s founding fathers and other leading officials. Princelings are liked by some party leaders because they often appear dedicated to keeping the party in power. But their huge influence offends many others. </p>\n<p>Mr Xi’s career has clearly benefited from his connections. He graduated from Beijing’s Tsinghua University in 1979 with a degree in engineering (which most Chinese leaders have). China was then emerging from the post-Mao era’s first succession crisis, with Deng busy nailing the political coffin of Mao’s heir, Hua Guofeng. Mr Xi landed a job as an assistant to the defence minister, one of his father’s friends. This soupçon of military experience has been played up in his official biography, which says he was an “officer on active service”.</p>\n<p>But Cheng Li of the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank, says Mr Xi’s family ties proved a handicap in 1997. At a party congress, delegates’ dislike of princelings contributed to his gaining the lowest number of votes in a (largely rigged) election for membership of the Central Committee. In 2007 Mr Xi is said to have gained the highest number of votes in a straw poll conducted at the Central Party School, an academy for top cadres, on possible candidates for the Politburo. But Mr Li says Mr Xi would not have done so well had the 400-odd high-ranking participants been asked who should be a member of the Politburo’s Standing Committee—much less who should be Mr Hu’s successor. </p>\n<p>And these are troubled times in which to be taking over. There are signs of serious disagreement among China’s elite over whether the party should change how it rules, at least a bit, to give people more say in who leads them. Since August the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, has made several comments on the importance of political reform. Other leaders have kept conspicuously silent on the issue, while conservative newspapers (including national dailies in Beijing) have censored his remarks. Rarely since the early 1990s has the party-controlled press appeared so divided. Liberals in Beijing have stepped up public demands for a loosening of the party’s grip, even as the authorities have detained dissidents for celebrating the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, an imprisoned activist. </p>\n<p>Mr Xi is among the silent ones. Some liberals, nonetheless, are encouraged by his father’s reformist credentials. They also point to his record in the provinces, where he gave strong encouragement to private enterprise. While in Zhejiang province, Mr Xi encouraged a team of senior researchers from Beijing to write a six-volume work called the “Zhejiang Experience and its Implication for the Development of China”. It stresses the importance of setting up party cells in private enterprises (by the end of 2004, it boasts, almost 99% of private firms with three or more party members had done so). It also highlights experiments with grassroots democracy, within the party and local governments. Mr Xi has apparently not done much to push this. <em>Oriental Outlook</em>, a Beijing magazine, reported this month that Zhejiang’s best-known such experiments, in Wenling city, had not taken off elsewhere because of meagre interest among local officials. </p>\n<p>Mr Xi is said to be an affable man. But there was a hint of irascibility in February 2009 when he told a group of Chinese in Mexico that “well-fed foreigners with nothing better to do” were “pointing their fingers” at China. In an interview with China’s state television network, CCTV, in November 2003, Mr Xi elaborated on the benefits of table-pounding when dealing with aberrant officials. “If you don’t thump the table you can’t frighten them”, he said. Most Chinese are more familiar with the beguiling smile of his wife, Peng Liyuan, whose syrupy folk songs made her famous long before Mr Xi emerged. </p>\n<p>By official reckoning, Mr Xi will head a “fifth generation” of communist leaders (after Mao, Deng, Jiang and Hu—Hua Guofeng having been too short-lived politically to count). Even if the chemical engineer Mr Xi (with a doctorate on China’s rural economy) looks little different from his predecessor (a hydraulic engineer), others of his generation are in less of a technocratic mould. Some have studied in the West. But this does not guarantee them popular support in a country with a fast-growing middle class with burgeoning aspirations.</p>\n<p>“I nearly spilt water all down my shirt. Are you trying to give me a fright?” replied Mr Xi in 2002 when asked by a reporter whether he was a leader to watch out for. He has good reason to be nervous.</p>","rubric":"China’s Communist Party anoints Xi Jinping as the country’s next leader.

How would Marx have coped with the restrictions on civil liberties evident in China today? He would have needed government permission to publish his Communist Manifesto, and this would have been refused. “You say our capitalist system will disappear!” Mr Xin imagined priggish 19th-century English censors exclaiming. “You can’t say that!”</p>\n<p>Freedom of speech and the press are enshrined in China’s constitution. But in reality there is only so much that people can say or write without getting into trouble. The occasion for the gathering at which Mr Xin spoke was the recent release from jail of Xie Chaoping, a former prosecutor and journalist who had written and published a book about the forced relocation of hundreds of thousands of people during the construction of a massive dam on the Yellow River in the 1950s. He had been detained for nearly a month by local officials in Shaanxi province who disapproved of his writings. The manager of his printing company was also detained. The case attracted great publicity, with many activists and intellectuals agitating for the two men’s release. </p>\n<p>Mr Xin was one of two dozen retired officials, academics and Communist Party elders who, citing Mr Xie’s case and others, argued recently for greater press freedom in a signed open letter to the leadership of the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s parliament. The mismatch between the right to freedom of the press, loftily asserted in the constitution, and the restrictions that are crudely enforced in practice, the group wrote, amounts to a form of “false democracy” that has “become a scandalous mark on the history of world democracy.”</p>\n  <p>This is not the first attempt to expand press freedom in China. During a period of relative political liberalisation in the late 1980s, NPC members spoke openly about the need for a liberal press law. But that movement was doomed by the government’s anxious, brutish response to the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989. The censor’s pen is still much in evidence. None of China’s thousands of newspapers and periodicals escapes it. And although officials pay occasional lip service to the fourth estate’s important “supervisory” role as a check against corruption and other abuses, they also define its primary role as a prop to social stability.</p>\n<p>It is not only dissidents who find their voices muffled. The open letter to parliament also complained that recent support for political reform expressed by Wen Jiabao, the prime minister, in speeches at the United Nations and elsewhere, had been scrubbed from the Chinese media.</p>\n<p>Yet many activists are optimistic that liberal change is coming. Dai Qing, a prominent dissident pundit, notes that activists are finding it easier to raise money for their causes at home. They “no longer have to rely on money from people like George Soros,” she says. She is also impressed by the diverse backgrounds of those pushing for a press law: they include young journalists, seasoned party members and officials, and even one or two military men.</p>","rubric":"Momentum builds for a freer press","id":"17309207"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Asia","headline":"A biggish dust-up in Karachi","title":"Pakistan's political crises","content":"<p>EVEN by Pakistani standards, this has been a bad week. Politically motivated battles erupted in Karachi, the country’s biggest city, on October 16th and raged for several days, leaving over 70 dead. The violence threatens to bring down the government of Sindh province, a coalition led by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which presides over Karachi. It could also destabilise the central government of President Asif Zardari, another PPP-led coalition.</p>\n<p>Karachi often sees bloodletting. The city of 18m is beset by land-grabbers and narco-warlords and by sectarian, ethnic and political feuding, or all three combined. This bout arose ahead of a by-election necessitated by the murder of a leading provincial lawmaker, a member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). Followers of the MQM, a party dedicated to Karachi’s Urdu-speaking muhajir community, were in the thick of the killing. So were those of its main rival, the Awami National Party (ANP), which is dedicated to Pushtuns. Both are allies of the PPP in Islamabad; its supporters were also in arms.</p>\n<p>“It seems there is no government in Karachi,” said the MQM’s leader, Altaf Hussain, who lives in exile in London. The MQM has threatened to quit the federal government, which could reduce it to a parliamentary minority. That would also suggest that the country’s powerful generals, from whom Mr Hussain has often taken orders, had run out of patience with Mr Zardari’s dysfunctional administration—at a time of multiple crises, including high inflation, a Taliban insurgency and devastating flooding that has left over 6m surviving on food aid.</p>\n  <p>And on October 15th Pakistan’s beleaguered president suffered another assault. At a dramatic midnight conclave, the country’s Supreme Court judges gave credence to rumours that Mr Zardari planned to sack them and vowed to defy him. The judges, who have claimed great powers during Mr Zardari’s two-year rule, have been trying to reopen a money-laundering case against the president. His main opponent, Nawaz Sharif, a two-time former prime minister and supporter of the judges, piled in by calling for the government to fall.</p>\n<p>Mr Zardari is plainly in trouble. A discredited figure, linked to the corruption that flourished under his murdered wife, Benazir Bhutto, he has never seemed fit to lead his crisis-ridden country. Even in the PPP, which accepted Mr Zardari as its leader in the panic-stricken wake of Ms Bhutto 2007 death, many despise him. And the generals are believed to consider him a corrupt and incompetent fool who should be banished.</p>\n<p>Yet they stay their hand, fearing Mr Sharif would be worse. A leader of Punjab, Pakistan’s richest and most populous province, he dared to sack two army chiefs while in power—which inspired the second of them, Pervez Musharraf, to launch a coup against him. Having since suffered imprisonment and a long exile, Mr Sharif wants revenge. Mr Musharraf is also now exiled to London, yet Mr Sharif continues to demand he be prosecuted for treason. The current army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, a former Musharraf loyalist, could never allow that.

Like many Anglo-Indians, members of a Eurasian community spawned during the Raj, she eats bacon and eggs for breakfast, speaks precise English and, though she has lived all her life in India, knows little Hindi or Bengali. Yet her home, hung with yellowing photographs of Queen Elizabeth and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, is thick with tales of poverty and loss.</p>\n<p>Recent decades have been tough on Anglo-Indians, who are defined by the constitution as Indian citizens of European paternal ancestry. Many can date that ancestry to the 18th- and early 19th-centuries, when British employees of the East India Company tended to come to India without wives, and found local women to fill the gap. Such intermingling became less common after the great mutiny of 1857. Yet its legacy, a class of educated, English-speaking and loyal Eurasians, was crucial to British rule. Anglo-Indians manned the customs, telephone exchanges and railways. Mimicking the grander seclusion of their British masters, they lived apart in purpose-built railway towns, disdaining their Indian colleagues. “All the Indians wanted to be Anglo-Indian,” said Malcolm Booth, an 83-year-old officer of the All India Anglo-Indian Association.</p>\n<p>But after the British quit India in 1947 the Anglos lost their privileges. They are still guaranteed two seats in India’s parliament, yet public funding for their schools was stopped in 1961. Few could compete in India’s new, non-discriminatory job market.

Relying on coal to generate about 80% of its electricity makes Australia one of the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters per head. Labor’s decision to abandon an earlier pledge for a European-style emissions-trading scheme (ETS) cost it seats at an election in August. Ironically it also left Ms Gillard relying on support from the Australian Greens to form a minority government.</p>\n<p>Ms Gillard has now ditched a much-lampooned election promise to establish a “citizens’ assembly” to discuss climate change. Instead, she has appointed a multiparty parliamentary committee to decide how Australia should make its worst carbon polluters pay. A report this week by the Climate Institute, a Sydney-based think-tank, suggests how hard that will be: comparing Australia with five of its main trading partners, only South Korea has done less to factor the cost of carbon emissions into its electricity prices.</p>\n<p>The Greens are claiming credit for Ms Gillard’s new climate concern. Some also detected their influence when she announced on October 18th a more moderate approach to another divisive election issue: the increasing numbers of asylum-seekers arriving in Australia by boat. Those with children will no longer be incarcerated, but allowed to live freely while their claims are assessed. The Greens have long called for such a change; Ms Gillard claimed it as her party’s idea.</p>\n  <p>The climate committee must decide by late 2011 the best way to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions: an ETS, a carbon tax or a hybrid of both. The Greens have two representatives on it, including Bob Brown, their leader. Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, two independents whose price for supporting Ms Gillard included a revival of climate-change action, are also on the committee. Only the opposition Liberal-National coalition is absent. Its leader, Tony Abbott, rejected Ms Gillard’s invitation to join. He has previously dismissed climate science as “crap” and the mooted mitigation measures as just a “great big tax”. Yet this populism has left him looking suddenly rather isolated. </p>\n<p>To help it think through the economic impact of a carbon tax, or similar measure, the government is consulting many of the country’s top businessmen—including former allies of Mr Abbott. This is encouraging, but the task of greening Australia is huge. According to the Climate Institute, Australia is the G20 country that is worst-prepared to compete in a low-carbon economy. Its report compares the additional costs imposed on electricity producers in six countries by anti-warming strategies, including carbon taxes, emission-trading schemes and clean-energy subsidies.</p>\n<p> In Australia, such measures represented an effective carbon tax of $1.70 per tonne—a figure 17 times lower than in Britain and eight times lower than in China, on the basis of a perhaps-generous interpretation of China’s efforts to make its coal-fired power stations more efficient. Only South Korea’s hidden carbon price of 70 cents was lower. One of the report’s authors, Cameron Hepburn, reckons that China will “almost certainly” adopt a national ETS or some alternative measure before Australia does.</p>","rubric":"The government considers a carbon tax","id":"17312248"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Asia","headline":"Nomads no more","title":"Mongolia's mining boom","content":"<p>MONGOLIANS were until recently wont to describe themselves as “beggars sitting on a huge pile of gold”. The country has vast but largely untapped mineral deposits. Until recently wages were low and jobs scarce. Shoppers in Ulan Bator, the capital, were not spoilt for choice—unless they were in the market for dried meat, vegetables or furry hats.</p>\n<p>But with the recent launch of several big mining projects, a transformation looms. It will present the government with a different set of problems: how to manage a promised economic boom without devastating the environment or destabilising either the economy or the nation’s fledgling democracy. </p>\n<p> Few doubt that the boom is coming. The IMF foresees a double-digit annual-growth rate for years to come; and a quadrupling of GDP per head—currently a measly $2,000—by 2018. Two mines in Mongolia’s southern Gobi region are expected to provide much of the new wealth. One, called Oyu Tolgoi, which was given the green light last year, will tap an estimated 40m tonnes of copper and also gold. The other is an existing coal mine, Tavan Tolgoi, to which new capacity has been added, including road and rail links to its main customer, China (surprise, surprise).</p>\n  <p>The government will be a big beneficiary of the boom: it owns a third of Oyu Tolgoi (a Canadian firm, Ivanhoe, owns the rest). Yet the country’s president, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, considers it potentially dangerous. “If we get much more income and much more profit in a bad system with bad governance, I think Mongolia is in trouble,” he says.</p>\n<p>Mongolian politics is already based on patronage, with politicians invariably offering cash and other goodies for votes. Swollen government coffers could exaggerate these bad habits. Corruption could also thrive—as it did in the 1990s, on the back of a hasty privatisation of state-owned businesses soon after the country emerged from the Soviet Union’s shadow and introduced democracy. Indeed, the involvement of many senior officials in mining makes this likely. And even virtuous public spending may push up inflation.</p>\n<p>An economy hooked on a handful of commodities is also vulnerable to price shocks. A new fiscal stability law has been adopted, setting indices for commodity prices for budgeting purposes. When prices go above the index, excess revenue will be stored in a “stability fund”. If prices fall, the government can tap the fund to cover its costs.</p>\n<p>Other precautions are being taken. New anti-corruption legislation has been passed. And Mr Elbegdorj vows to help boost investments in non-mining sectors, including tourism, finance and outsourcing. He says that mining’s contribution to output should shrink from 70%, its current level, to around 20% within two decades.</p>\n<p>That sounds unlikely. Yet there is hope that Mongolia’s current leaders, who are better educated than their predecessors, do at least understand the dilemmas involved in managing the coming riches and the rising expectations they will bring. “It’s a question of whether we become Nigeria or Chile,” says a senior government adviser, in a country accelerating away from its sleepy nomadic past.</p>","rubric":"A steppe-land struggles with new riches","id":"17312256"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Asia","headline":"SBY's feet of clay","title":"Banyan","content":"<p>BEFORE last year’s elections in Indonesia, supporters of the incumbent president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, predicted that victory would lead to a markedly different second term for their champion. A mild-mannered ditherer, he would emerge triumphant and transformed, as a bold and decisive reformer: Super-SBY! Sure enough, his Democrat Party became the largest in parliament and Mr Yudhoyono was re-elected in a landslide. But, as Indonesia marked the first anniversary of his second inauguration on October 20th, SBY2 was looking very much like SBY1. Indeed, in some ways it looks worse. Even some of Mr Yudhoyono’s fans admit to being disappointed.</p>\n<p>That might seem harsh. Under his presidency, Indonesia has become a success story. In November Barack Obama will return to Indonesia, his childhood home and the country that has more Muslims than any other, to pay his respects to a flourishing democracy and bastion of tolerance. Protests marked this week’s anniversary with calls for Mr Yudhoyono to resign. But opinion polls suggest that he remains a popular president, though his once sky-high approval ratings have fallen. Even some environmentalists, traditional thorns in the flesh of Indonesian governments, like him: Mr Yudhoyono having declared a two-year moratorium on large-scale clearance of the country’s rainforests from January 2011.</p>\n<p> More broadly, Indonesia’s global stature is rising. The public finances are sound and the economy has sailed through the financial crisis. Among G20 economies, only China and India grew faster than the 4.5% Indonesia achieved last year. In 2010 the rate is likely to be close to 6%. That would have seemed almost unimaginable 12 years ago, when the economy collapsed and Indonesia’s longstanding dictator, Suharto, fell.</p>\n  <p>Yet it is not churlish to look for more. Indonesia is underperforming. A recent “strategic assessment” by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University concluded that it is losing ground to its neighbours. Its resilience during the global downturn was in part caused by its skipping the pre-crisis trade boom. Its recovery has been pulled along by Chinese hunger for commodities—notably coal and palm oil. With its wealth of resources, and young population, Indonesia should achieve respectable rates of growth for decades. But respectability will not create enough jobs, let alone secure Indonesia’s aim of becoming “an advanced and self-reliant nation by 2025”.</p>\n<p>Many development indicators are bad. In terms of GDP per person, for example, Indonesia is much richer than Vietnam. Yet an Indonesian mother is over three times more likely to die in childbirth than a Vietnamese mother. And her child is nearly three times more likely to die before the age of five.</p>\n<p>An important step the government could take to improve things would be to spend less on wasteful subsidies—which account for at least half of its “discretionary” spending (which excludes interest payments, for example)—and more on infrastructure, education and health. Mr Yudhoyono’s previous finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, made a start on this. But she has since left to join the World Bank, apparently sacrificed in the interests of coalition politics after a tiff with Aburizal Bakrie, a leading businessman, party leader and former cabinet member.</p>\n<p>Rather than use his party’s parliamentary numbers to push through reform, Mr Yudhoyono has stuck with a timid consensus style, building a bigger, weaker six-party coalition than he needs. Four of his smaller coalition partners have Islamic roots. To foster some Islamic credentials of his own, perhaps, the president has seemed disappointingly slow to stand up for greater religious tolerance. His government seems especially reluctant to stamp out violence by the “Islamic Defenders’ Front”, or FPI, a group of thugs with religious pretensions and a record of bloody intimidation against Christians, Muslims of the Ahmadiyah sect and others. And allegations of brutality by the security forces against secessionists in Papua—backed by a gruesome video this week that appeared to show suspects being tortured—suggest that the army has not shed the bad habits it developed in East Timor and Aceh. No senior member of the armed forces, in which Mr Yudhoyono was once a general, has been convicted for abuses carried out under Suharto or since.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the president is jeopardising one of his most popular traits: hard-earned credentials as a warrior against corruption. Some of the big fish netted in his first term by a feared anti-corruption commission, the KPK, have been freed early. They include the father of Mr Yudhoyono’s daughter-in-law. Accounts of a VIP’s life in an Indonesian jail anyway make it sound more like a four-star hotel chain than a chain-gang. Worse, no action has been taken against those in the police and the attorney-general’s office found to have fabricated evidence last year in a witch-hunt against KPK officials. The president seems sincere in his abhorrence of corruption, but unwilling to take on vested interests threatened by the anti-graft drive. </p>\n<p><a name=\"saving_graces\"></a><br><strong>Saving graces</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Still, Mr Yudhoyono has two big things going for him. First, he may be a Suharto-era general, but he is no Suharto-style dictator. Rather, he practises what the Harvard report calls “collusive democracy”, preferring co-option and consensus to competition. Second, he stands far above any potential successor. As bellicose rival politicians rattled their kris in a recent fishing row with Malaysia, he was statesmanlike and calm.

He walked off in a huff.</p>\n      \n  <p>Ordinary Nigerians are angry too. The power supply, they say, is “epileptic”. Nigeria is a big oil exporter, but its people get only a few hours of electricity a day. The entire population–around 150m–is said to use as much grid power as the area around Narita airport in Tokyo. South Africans consume 55 times more energy per head, and Americans 100 times more.</p>\n<p>The problem is not new. Nigeria’s power supply has been stagnant for 30 years. During the tumultuous 1990s there was no investment despite surging demand. Since then, generation capacity has risen by half but distribution is so dysfunctional that actual supply has remained flat. One result is a laughably small manufacturing sector, about 4% of GDP.</p>\n<p>There have been reform attempts in the past. The Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), the monopoly supplier, is known to consumers as Please Have Candle Nearby. Five years ago it replaced the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA), nicknamed Never Expect Power Again. Mischarging and other sins continued. “I just got a bill for the last four months but had no lights for three,” says a doctor 20 miles (32km) outside the capital, Abuja.</p>\n<p>To survive, many Nigerians have their own power plants, creating the world’s highest concentration of small-scale generators. Two-thirds of all electricity is produced in basements and backyards, at a cost of $13 billion a year. Generator merchants say the government is their best client. Some have set up steel plants to keep up with demand. One has 3,000 workers assembling the grunting machines.</p>\n<p>All this could change if the privatisation scheme succeeds. It aims to raise $3.5 billion a year and boost the power supply 13-fold over a decade. The government is offering to guarantee some bank loans and may cap the interest at 7%. At a recent conference in Abuja Mr Jonathan wooed hundreds of investors, including executives from Goldman Sachs and General Electric.</p>\n<p>Other African leaders are watching closely, sensing that this may prove to be a test bed for the continent. Some, though not all (see <a href=\"/node/17314616\">article</a>), are asking what alternatives there are to growing dependence on Chinese investment. Like most of its neighbours, Nigeria is making big infrastructure deals with China. In May, it inked a $23 billion Chinese oil refinery project. But Mr Jonathan acknowledges that China’s interest in Africa is no panacea. The case for privatisation will get a boost if he can keep the lights on at home.</p>\n<p>There are reasons to be optimistic. The programme has a sound legal basis. It follows a conventional privatisation model. Its pricing scheme seems transparent. That has reassured investors. They also welcome the easy access to local-currency loans in Nigeria, one of Africa’s most developed capital markets. And they like the country’s strong GDP growth, expected to top 7% this year.</p>\n<p>Yet there is still plenty to worry about. Supplying new power stations with gas is a headache, as is recruiting competent staff. But it is the politics of privatisation that investors fear most. There will be plenty of losers, many with vocal lobbies. Trade unions are protesting against staff cuts, although the president has set aside money for compensation. Consumers fear steep price hikes. The fuel mafia that supplies generator owners is up in arms.</p>\n<p>Even more worrying, the corrupt state bureaucracy is drooling in anticipation. The influx of billions of dollars will create long queues at the trough. Observers warn of the “rascality” of Nigerian officials.</p>\n<p>The president says he will work hard to make his privatisation plan work. To convince investors, he has appointed himself electricity minister and scheduled weekly power summits (11am on Tuesdays). He has also surrounded himself with men familiar to potential investors. The central bank governor and the finance minister are career bankers with experience abroad. He calls them his “war cabinet”, although they have limited influence.</p>\n<p>The strongest pitch the government could make would be its own re-election. Voting is due early next year and for the first time in recent history the outcome is uncertain. The president’s party—dominant since the end of military rule 11 years ago—cannot agree on a nominee. The losers in a forthcoming primary may break away. One-party rule could end.</p>\n<p>As the election campaign picks up pace, the president’s focus is likely to drift and electricity may return to the back burner. Or perhaps it already has. At the two-day conference in Abuja, Mr Jonathan failed to show up for the second day. Apparently, he was lured away to another meeting by his wife, Dame Patience, who is one of his closest advisers.</p>\n<p>For now, privatisation is wobbling along and some deals may be done. But consumers will have to wait until next year before they can even think about turning off their generators. Good luck and patience will both be needed.</p>","rubric":"The president is launching Africa’s most ambitious privatisation scheme shortly before facing a tight election","id":"17312103"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Middle East &amp; Africa","headline":"Looking east","title":"Ethiopia and China","content":"<p>THE release of Ethiopia’s best-known political prisoner, Birtukan Mideksa, seems to have been calculated to distract attention from a reshuffle of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The prime minister, Meles Zenawi, has replaced several long-serving ministers with younger men. He now faces little opposition either inside or outside the party. Speaking in New York last month, Mr Meles said that Ms Mideksa had begged for a pardon after only a “few weeks” in prison. In fact, she has spent most of the past five years behind bars, on trumped-up charges. She was more or less abandoned by Western governments keen to curry favour with Mr Meles. As a final humiliation, the government forced Ms Mideksa, as a condition of her release, to apologise in writing for “deceiving the Ethiopian people”. </p>\n<p>The EPRDF won all but two of the 547 parliamentary seats in a general election in May. So much for its promotion of plurality. Government supporters point to wider ethnic diversity within the party, with support said to be growing among the Amharas and Oromos, two ethnic groups. But the security apparatus remains in the hands of Mr Meles’s Tigrayan minority. Mr Meles has been in power since 1991. Ethiopia has no term limits, but he says he will step down in 2015.</p>\n<p>Mr Meles’s contempt for what he calls the “neoliberalism” of the West is as plain as his admiration for “generous” and “dependable” China. Chinese Communist Party officials were feted at a recent EPRDF conference. Hailemariam Desalegn, the new foreign minister and deputy prime minister, has been conspicuous in urging Ethiopia to follow China’s model. </p>\n  <p>Mr Meles argues that the free market has cost Africa decades of development. By siding with China, this will never happen again. The Europeans and Americans find this galling, since they continue to pay for many of Ethiopia’s hospitals and schools, as well as handing out free food. But trade between Ethiopia and China is increasingly what matters. It was worth $800m in the first six months of this year, up by 27% on last year.</p>\n<p> China has invested $2.5 billion in Ethiopia, mostly in infrastructure. Mr Meles wants China to take a lead in building a new railway network. He has also promised to use Chinese loans to build a controversial dam on the Omo River in the south. And China has decided to lend Ethiopia $234m so that nine vessels are built in Chinese shipyards for the Ethiopian Shipping Line, which operates out of Djibouti. </p>\n<p>Mr Meles’s ambitious plans to pep up his country of 85m people do not include a stock exchange. Enterprise, skills, and connectivity are years behind neighbouring Kenya. But Mr Meles is shrewd. He hopes Ethiopia’s massive trade deficit will narrow as his country’s new factories export goods under preferential trade terms. Last year exports to China rose by 140%.</p>","rubric":"Meles Zenawi’s new best pal","id":"17314616"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Middle East &amp; Africa","headline":"Brothers in arms","title":"Corruption in South Africa","content":"<p>BIGWIGS from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) have got what they wanted. A ten-year investigation into a dodgy $5 billion arms deal has been closed. Only two people were brought to book in South Africa’s biggest corruption scandal. One of them was Schabir Shaik, President Jacob Zuma’s former financial adviser, sentenced in 2005 to 15 years in jail for soliciting a bribe from a French company for Mr Zuma, then deputy president. Corruption charges against Mr Zuma himself were dropped last year on a legal technicality, just weeks before elections that swept him into the presidency.</p>\n<p>The whole saga does little to inspire confidence in Mr Zuma’s vaunted campaign to stamp out corruption. In a recent study of 200 leading South African companies by Deloitte, an international consultancy, corruption was cited as their biggest concern. In another study by the World Bank, one-third of South African firms said they expected to make “gifts” to secure a government contract. A paper submitted to the ANC’s national council in September admits the party is racked by bribery.</p>\n<p>Every day some new scandal seems to emerge. It is difficult to judge whether this is a sign of the cancer spreading, or whether it is the result of serious action being taken at last. In the past, such things tended to be swept under the carpet, with the erring official getting off with a mere slap on the wrist. But since Mr Zuma came to power, an extraordinary array of senior civil servants, as well as thousands of lesser minions, have been sacked, prosecuted and even convicted for their self-enriching shenanigans. Among them is Jackie Selebi, South Africa’s former police chief and erstwhile head of Interpol, jailed in August for 15 years for taking bribes from South Africa’s criminal underworld.</p>\n  <p>Despite a clutch of anti-graft measures brought in by Mr Zuma, the suspicion remains that those at the very top will continue to escape sanction. This was reinforced by the scuttling of the arms-deal investigation by the Hawks, a special police unit that replaced the much-feted Scorpions last year. The latter had shown no hesitation in going after political leaders, including Mr Zuma himself. Hence, many suspect, its early demise. It had been hoped that the Hawks, which has taken on many of the former Scorpions investigators, might come to show the same zeal, but it has failed at its first big hurdle.</p>","rubric":"An embarrassing graft probe is scuttled","id":"17314596"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Middle East &amp; Africa","headline":"Don't be too cheeky","title":"Bloggers in the Middle East","content":"<p>A MONTH ago a court in Iran sentenced Hossein Derakhshan, an Iranian-Canadian, to almost 20 years in jail, the longest sentence ever handed down to a blogger. The charges were murky. He was convicted of co-operating with hostile states and insulting Islam. Often hailed as Iran’s “blogfather”, he published a do-it-yourself guide to blogging in Persian earlier this decade that helped to prompt an explosion of activity. Today there may be as many as 75,000 Persian blogs. </p>\n<p>A harsh critic of Iran’s rulers for many years, Mr Derakhshan boasted on his blog of making a trip to Israel, probably the source of the charge of collaborating with Iran’s enemies. But more recently he had begun to defend the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He brushed off concerns that he could be arrested because of his earlier views. But on his return to Iran in November 2008 the authorities nabbed him.</p>\n<p>Iran is far from alone in locking up bloggers. Governments across the Middle East are increasingly twitchy about their citizens’ online activities. As internet use in the region has soared—up 19-fold since 2000, compared with a fivefold rise in the rest of the world, according to Internet World Stats, which monitors global internet usage—so the number jailed for what they do on the web has shot up too.</p>\n  <p>According to Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based watchdog, at least 17 “netizens” are in jail across the Middle East: eight in Iran and the rest in Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United Arab Emirates. China may be the biggest online represser, but the Middle East is not far behind.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Syrian officials confirmed that in December 2009 Tal al-Mallohi, a 19-year-old student, was arrested, accused of spying. She has been held without charge for nine months. Many believe her blog is to blame. Earlier this year a Lebanese blogger, Khodor Salameh, was interrogated after writing a post lampooning Michel Suleiman, the country’s president.</p>\n<p>Egypt is little better. Two of its policemen are accused of beating to death a young man, Muhammad Khaled Said, outside an internet café in Alexandria in June after he posted an online video incriminating the police in a drug deal. The incident provoked angry protests online and in the streets. Another Egyptian blogger, Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman, was arrested in November 2006 for blog posts criticising senior clerics and the government. He has been in detention ever since. Bahrain is getting edgy too. Ali Abdulemam, the monarchy’s best-known blogger, was jailed last month, accused of disseminating false information on his internet forum.</p>\n<p>Governments are not only applying existing laws fiercely but also trying to come up with new ones. A new electronic media law in Saudi Arabia will require all online news sites to register. Bloggers will be encouraged to do so as well. A rare bit of good news for bloggers is that Jordan’s government has withdrawn some repressive elements of a proposed temporary law on cyber crimes that would have allowed the government to punish those whose posts upset the authorities. The change of stance came after a flurry of online protests.</p>\n<p>The authorities are getting better at exploiting the internet themselves. After the big demonstrations in Iran last year, they circulated pictures of protesters online for members of the public to identify. In May this year, Ebrahim Jabari, a Revolutionary Guard commander, confirmed that the regime had set up a “cyber-army” to crack down on “destructive” online networks. His unit has since hacked into dozens of sites and is thought to be responsible for the arrests of hundreds of Iranians.</p>\n<p>Western governments as well as human-rights campaigners are watching the fate of bloggers closely. In January Hillary Clinton, the American secretary of state, expressed support for internet freedom. More recently Bernard Kouchner, France’s foreign minister, said: “We must support cyber-dissidents in the same way that we supported political dissidents.”</p>","rubric":"Governments in the Middle East are cracking down on bloggers","id":"17312290"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Middle East &amp; Africa","headline":"We built this city on rock'n'roll","title":"Israel and Palestine","content":"<p>FOR over 20 years Ariel was Israel’s fastest-growing settlement, changing from a campsite on a rocky outcrop in 1978 into the first Jewish city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. But over the past decade, Ariel has stagnated, adding a mere 100 housing units. Three other settlements closer to Israel proper, including two that were puny ultra-orthodox villages when Ariel boomed, have swelled to twice its size.</p>\n<p>For mediators committed to reviving the wobbly peace process, this paralysis is a rare piece of good news. Ariel, says Ron Nachman, the city’s founder and mayor, was intended to undermine the viability of a Palestinian state. It sits on top of a mountain ridge whose eastern edge reaches 23km (14 miles) into the West Bank, in essence cutting it in two.</p>\n<p> Previous Israeli leaders contemplating retreat close to the original 1967 border helped to check Ariel’s growth. But Israel’s current prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, promised to improve the settlement’s fortunes when he was still in opposition. He visited it more than any other settlement, and soon after taking power, he went there to plant a tree.</p>\n  <p>Whether this attempted revival will work is unclear. Mr Nachman always wanted his city to be the West Bank’s Tel Aviv, full of secular people. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union, only moderately religious, make up half the population, but their birth rates are low. To boost numbers he has recruited thousands of students from the coastal plains, turning fanatical garrisons into bourgeois dorms. But most students move on before they have families.</p>\n<p>That leaves settlement leaders urging an ailing Mr Nachman to abandon his secular dream and welcome ideological rather than economic settlers. Not only are they more committed to populating the West Bank, but they breed faster.</p>\n<p> For now, Mr Nachman continues to spurn the ultra-orthodox Jews who have peopled much larger settlements. But seemingly holding his nose, he has welcomed religious “Anglos”, or English-speaking Jewish immigrants, including a South African rabbi. He has also made room for some of the religious settlers Israel moved from Gaza when it pulled out in 2005.

This is the routine whenever unions hold a one-day strike, as they did (again) on October 19th, against the raising of the legal minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 years. But the petrol shortages, blockaded oil depots and schools, jammed roads, burnt cars and sporadic violence this week were of a quite different order. The shift from organised protest towards disorganised rebellion has put Mr Sarkozy’s determination not to back down to its stiffest test yet. </p>\n<p>The routine protests this week were mostly peaceful, even festive. Anywhere between 1.1m and 3.5m took to the streets, including leaders of the opposition Socialists, for the sixth day of protests this autumn against pension reform. This approached the previous week’s record turnout, although the strike rate dipped: from 40% to 30% at the national railway, from 19% to 12% among civil servants, and from 18% to 15% at EDF, the energy utility. </p>\n<p>But it was not marching protesters or striking train drivers who shifted the atmosphere so abruptly this week. It was the spreading petrol shortages, combined with improvised guerrilla protests: lorry drivers blocking roads in “Operation snail”, <em>lycée </em>students shutting down schools, protesters invading railway tracks and airports and vandals looking for trouble. </p>\n  <p>This week workers at all 12 of France’s refineries were on strike and many oil depots were blocked, disrupting petrol supplies and prompting motorists into panic-buying. The government’s initial insistence that there were no petrol shortages was shown to be absurd, as drivers toured from station to station in search of fuel, or joined lengthy queues. Jean-Louis Borloo, the environment minister and aspirant prime minister if François Fillon is replaced, finally admitted that almost a third of the country’s 13,000 petrol stations had run out of fuel. Mr Sarkozy ordered the police to lift blockades of oil depots and ensure the resumption of distribution. </p>\n<p>At the same time, 379 <em>lycées </em>were disrupted or closed on October 19th by protesting school pupils, who in France have their own unions. Although not directly touched by pension reform, many pupils seem to think that, if 60-year-olds work for two years longer, they will have to wait two more years before they can inherit their jobs. More worrying than economic illiteracy, <em>lycée </em>protests are often used by <em>casseurs</em>, or vandals, as cover for troublemaking. In Lyon 1,300 <em>casseurs</em>, half of them under 18, rioted in the historic centre, torching and overturning vehicles, looting shops and smashing up bus shelters. A courthouse in Nanterre, west of Paris, was vandalised. In Le Mans, a junior high school was burned to a cinder. </p>\n<p>Mr Sarkozy declared that he would not let the country be “paralysed” by blockades or unrest. Nor, he said, would he back down on reform, because it was his “duty” to guarantee pensions for future generations. The pension bill has already been passed by the lower house, and voting in the upper house, although delayed this week, should conclude soon. The government is hoping that the French will tire of protesting, and that support for the strikes will ebb. Above all, schools break up on October 22nd for a ten-day half-term—and French unions like their holidays too much to disrupt them with strikes. </p>\n<p>Yet if they give up, the unions stand to lose credibility. National leaders, such as Bernard Thibault, of the communist-backed Confédération Générale du Travail, France’s most powerful union, are under pressure from their grass-roots not to cave in. Union bosses were due to meet on October 21st to decide what to do once the upper house votes. Some argue that protests should continue. The two chambers still need to vote on a final version of the bill, probably next week, before it becomes law. In 2006 student-led protests against labour-market reforms forced the government of the day to retreat, even after the bill had been signed into law.</p>\n<p>The difficulty for Mr Sarkozy is that pension reform has become a touchstone for general grievances. He and Mr Fillon have tried to explain the need for France to preserve benefits for tomorrow’s pensioners by lengthening working life. He has given some ground to the unions over the detail of the reform. But he is unpopular and distrusted. And he is linked in the popular mind with wealth and big business, an image reinforced by recent blunders in his ministerial team: cigars charged to expenses, a private jet hired by a minister, conflicts of interest tied to Liliane Bettencourt, the billionaire heiress to the L’Oréal empire. By contrasting the plight of “workers” facing two extra years of toil with the high life of the elite, the left has shamelessly whipped up a feeling of injustice about what is, in reality, a rather timid reform. </p>\n<p>The turmoil beamed out on French television screens this week could yet begin to turn public opinion, which has so far mostly backed the protests. Although 67% of respondents to one poll this week said they supported the routine strikes and demonstrations, 54% were against the blockade of oil refineries. The government is looking for an offer to make to the unions, unrelated to pension reform, that would allow them to save face. But if the rebellion fails to die down, Mr Sarkozy will be in a tight corner—and his plan to reshuffle the government after pension reform is done will have to be put off even longer. </p>","rubric":"The protests against the government’s proposed pension reform turn ugly","id":"17312113"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Europe","headline":"Zapatero's endgame","title":"Spanish politics","content":"<p>CAN things get any worse for José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Spain’s beleaguered prime minister? Probably not. Austerity measures, labour reform and strikes have taken their toll: opinion polls show support for his Socialist Party plummeting to 29%, while unemployment, at over 20%, remains twice the euro-zone average. Speculation is rife over who will succeed Mr Zapatero as party leader, and whether he will step down before or after the next general election, due in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hoping to secure his survival for the next 18 months, on October 20th Mr Zapatero unveiled a cabinet reshuffle. Out went Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the long-serving foreign minister, to be replaced by Trinidad Jiménez, the health minister and a favourite of Mr Zapatero’s. Two ministries were scrapped entirely. Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the veteran interior minister, adds the jobs of deputy prime minister and government spokesman to his portfolio. </p>\n<p>A few days earlier Mr Zapatero had sealed a pact with the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to ensure the passage of his minority government’s budget. Mr Zapatero’s boosters said the deal would help keep the prime minister in his job until 2012. Iñigo Urkullu, the PNV’s leader, gave no guarantee, but said that Mr Zapatero should reach the finishing line. In return, his party has won further transfers of power and money to the already highly devolved Basque regional government.</p>\n  <p>The reshuffle and the pact will free the Socialists to focus on a number of electoral contests to come—and to decide whether Mr Zapatero is the man to lead them into battle. The prospect of a series of heavy losses in regional elections over the next eight months, starting with Catalonia on November 28th, has started to concentrate minds within the party.</p>\n<p>In early October Mr Zapatero suffered his first big internal party defeat. In a primary election to choose a candidate to lead the Socialists into elections for the Madrid parliament next May, Tomás Gómez, the party’s leader in the capital, beat Ms Jiménez. This led to calls for change. “We are heading towards electoral disaster if we do not change tack,” said José María Barreda, the Socialists’ leader in the region of Castile La Mancha. Carme Chacón, the defence minister, chose this moment to state that Spain was ready for its first woman prime minister, sparking debate about whether she was pitching for the job.</p>\n<p>The question now is not whether Mr Zapatero will go, but when. Will he lead the party to electoral defeat in 2012 and fall on his sword afterwards, or will he stand down just before, recognising that only a fresh Socialist leader can stop a severe drubbing by the conservative People’s Party? The PP’s lead in some polls has risen to 14 points, enough to give it an absolute majority in parliament. Mr Zapatero has said, privately, that he will make the decision next year, according to <em>El País</em>. </p>\n<p>Who might come next? Ms Chacón would certainly present a different face. A 39-year-old, she would represent both a new generation and a gender revolution. She made headlines on her first day in office by inspecting troops when seven months’ pregnant. Other potential candidates include Mr Rubalcaba and Eduardo Madina, a 34-year-old rising star. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Spain continues its snail-paced recovery. Few people outside the government expect growth above 1% next year. The IMF predicts that unemployment will remain the highest in the euro zone for at least five years. The devastated housing market has further to fall, and 20% of mortgage-holders could find themselves in negative equity, according to Standard &amp; Poor’s, a credit-rating agency.</p>\n<p>Spain’s recovery, in other words, will at best be faintly apparent by the time voters reach the polling booths early in 2012.

When the Greek debt crisis threatened to engulf Iberia in May, Spain went in for the kill, slashing spending and freezing pensions. The more measured approach of José Sócrates, Portugal’s prime minister, involved limiting wage cuts to politicians and senior civil servants, increasing value-added tax and postponing big infrastructure projects. Spain’s quick moves helped it escape the storm. But Portugal’s borrowing costs soared to a euro-era record in September. Now Mr Sócrates has been forced to accept his mistake with a new austerity package at least as tough as Spain’s. </p>\n\n<p>Mr Sócrates’s measures, now before parliament as part of his minority government’s 2011 budget proposals, have reassured investors that Portugal can meet its target of cutting the budget deficit from 9.4% of GDP in 2009 to 4.6% next year (see chart). Described as “brutal” by the unions, which have called a one-day national strike for November, the bill will cut public-sector wages by 5%, increase VAT again, freeze state pensions and chop welfare payments. </p>\n<p>The opposition Social Democrats, who have enough seats to defeat the government, want fewer tax rises and more spending cuts. A messy compromise is likely in the next few weeks. But Mr Sócrates’s main challenge is how to return the economy to growth.

To keep government borrowing costs manageable, however, he has been forced to take an axe to the deficit. </p>\n<p>Painful austerity is an essential condition for lasting growth, but it is not enough on its own.

The sacking of Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow for 18 years, and the Kremlin’s decision to replace him with Sergei Sobyanin, is a change of political formation. Mr Luzhkhov, one of the last autonomous regional barons in Russia, was a relic of the 1990s. Although he backed Vladimir Putin for the presidency in 2000 and remained loyal, in exchange for retaining economic control over Moscow, he was his own man. He behaved like an elected mayor even after Mr Putin scrapped elections for regional mayors and governors in 2004.</p>\n<p>Mr Sobyanin, by contrast, is a figure of the 2000s. Reserved and inscrutable, he could not be more different from his extrovert predecessor. As head of the oil-rich Tyumen province, Mr Sobyanin was among the first governors to support Mr Putin’s abolition of regional elections. His appointment signifies the return of Moscow to the Kremlin’s lap, says Olga Kryshtanovskaya, a sociologist and member of Mr Putin’s United Russia party.</p>\n<p>Like many capital cities, Moscow is an anomaly. It accounts for roughly 10% of Russia’s population and a quarter of national economic output—comparable to the oil and gas industry. Until Mr Luzhkov’s sacking, the city represented the last bastion of regionalism outside the Kremlin’s control. Mr Sobyanin’s appointment irons out this kink. The change was executed by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s president, but it reflects Mr Putin’s choice.</p>\n  <p>Mr Putin has every reason to have confidence in Mr Sobyanin. After he became president, he used Mr Sobyanin, a member of the upper house of parliament, to help him get rid of Yury Skuratov, Russia’s renegade prosecutor-general. In 2005 Mr Putin made Mr Sobyanin chief of the presidential administration. When he then decided that Mr Medvedev should succeed him as president in 2008, Mr Sobyanin was entrusted with running the campaign. After Mr Putin became prime minister, Mr Sobyanin was appointed his deputy.</p>\n<p>Unlike so much of the ruling elite, Mr Sobyanin does not come from St Petersburg (he is a native of Siberia) and has no background in the security services. And although he has worked closely with the country’s big oil companies, he is not part of the oil lobby. Rather, he is a man of the system and its values, the most important of which is the supremacy of the state and its representatives. Extending and entrenching this notion will be his purpose. </p>\n<p>As a member of the politburo of United Russia, Mr Sobyanin will ensure the party’s overwhelming victory in next year’s parliamentary elections.

The Lisbon treaty, successor to the ill-fated European Union constitution, which in turn followed the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties, would create a permanent club rulebook. “We expect no change in the foreseeable future,” European leaders declared in December 2007. Freed from its internal wrangling, the EU would be able to turn outward and face the real world. Instead, the real world threw up the euro-zone debt crisis. And less than a year after the Lisbon treaty came into force, the EU is talking of a new treaty. </p>\n<p>Brussels’s favourite game has been restarted by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. At their summit in the French resort of Deauville (where they also met Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev) this week, they declared that, in order to deal with future debt crises, “it is necessary to revise the treaty”. What fun. Remember the French and Dutch rejection of the constitution? How the Irish had to vote twice to approve the slimmed-down Lisbon treaty? The thrill of the Czechs keeping Europe guessing until the 11th hour? Let’s do it all again. This time, in the face of economic crisis and budget cuts, it will be even more exciting to run the gauntlet of parliaments, constitutional courts and angry voters—and all in the name of imposing still greater fiscal rigour in future.</p>\n<p>The idea of reopening the treaties had seemed merely to be a preposterous German obsession. Berlin was demanding that spendthrift countries in breach of the euro zone’s fiscal limits (deficits at 3% of GDP and public debt at 60% of GDP) be threatened with losing their EU voting rights. Last month the European Commission focused instead on measures that could be implemented under existing treaties. It proposed intensified monitoring of countries’ budgets and economic imbalances, plus a system of escalating warnings and sanctions that would be imposed “semi-automatically”: sinning countries would be punished unless finance ministers voted by a qualified (weighted) majority to stop the proposed sanctions.</p>\n  <p>These proposals were largely inspired by the austere Germans. At the start of a meeting of European finance ministers in Luxembourg on October 18th the French predictably criticised the notion of “automaticity”, which they said removed too much political discretion. To the astonishment of those in the room, the German deputy finance minister, Jörg Asmussen, agreed. Fiscal hawks fumed about German betrayal. Led by the Dutch, they fought a rearguard action to preserve something of the semi-automatic weapon. What deal did Germany cut with France? Part of the answer came that evening from Deauville: France changed its mind and now supported a new treaty. Yet critics see this as a bad bargain. Germany has surrendered feasible sanctions for the promise of a treaty that may never pass. Few governments, or their voters, will vote to disenfranchise themselves. Yet more than just amending voting rights, Germany’s real goal is to create a permanent means of restructuring the debts of bust countries and a bail-out fund that is treaty-based. </p>\n<p>On this point Germany will make itself heard. Without its deep pockets there would have been no €110 billion ($145 billion) rescue of Greece and no €750 billion bail-out fund to help others. These measures are hailed as evidence that the EU can act decisively in a crisis. Many want them made permanent. But Germany refuses to extend them beyond 2013 without some system to deal with insolvent states.</p>\n<p>Germany’s well-being is bound up with the fate of the euro; it saved Greece partly to help itself. But without strict conditions on profligate states and the imposition of losses on reckless creditors, all are taking a free ride on Germany. Some say that a formal debt-restructuring system will raise the cost of borrowing and frighten skittish markets. But even France recognises that Germany has a case. The odds are that others will, grudgingly, agree. </p>\n<p>All will want only a limited treaty change, perhaps one that applies only in the euro zone. But past experience suggests that such keyhole surgery may prove impossible. The European Parliament will want more power. Ireland will almost certainly have to put any new treaty to a referendum. As it imposes ever harsher budget cuts, Brian Cowen’s government can only dread the prospect. Eurosceptics in Britain may seize the moment to call for a repatriation of powers from Brussels. Britain wants a stable euro zone, but is torn. It does not want to be bound by the EU’s fiscal rules, but nor does it want a more tightly integrated euro zone leading to a two-speed Europe. And any institutional wrangling over Europe can only upset the coalition’s delicate balance. Nobody knows how Vaclav Klaus, the Eurosceptic Czech president, might react.</p>\n<p><a name=\"why_the_rush\"></a><br><strong>Why the rush?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many wonder why Mrs Merkel wants to tread into such a minefield. Perhaps, after the unpopular Greek bail-out, she needs to show she can hold spendthrift states to account. A more important reason is that Germany’s constitutional court is concerned about German-financed bail-outs, so a lawyer-proof system is needed. Many thought it would be best to wait for bond markets to calm down before tinkering with the rules. But others say that if treaty amendment is needed, it is best to get on with it. A new text would best be negotiated before the 2012 French presidential election, and ratified before Germany’s 2013 election.</p>\n<p>Don’t count on this being the final word, either. The European “construction” is a half-built project. The EU’s members are part-integrated and part-sovereign, and the contradictions cause inevitable upheavals.

A drumroll of leaks and horror stories over the summer created a grim build-up to George Osborne’s second big day as chancellor of the exchequer: the moment when he would reveal where the spending cuts set out in his June budget would be made. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the actual occasion on October 20th was somewhat less dramatic than billed—the House of Commons was quite muted as MPs listened to the chancellor’s statement—yet it will still prove crucial for the futures of both the coalition government and the country.</p>\n<p>Mr Osborne stuck to his guns about the overall scale and pace of fiscal retrenchment in the four years to 2014-15, the final year of this parliament. He insisted that this harsh medicine was vital to cut Britain’s bloated budget deficit, expected to be 10% of GDP this year. True, the chancellor added some £2 billion ($3.2 billion) a year to capital budgets. But no one can seriously suggest he has gone soft by aiming for total cuts of £81 billion rather than the previously announced £83 billion by 2014-15. </p>\n<p>The government has already taken a first small step towards that saving by stripping £5 billion out of this year’s spending. These were the early cuts criticised during the general-election campaign by Labour and, then, the Liberal Democrats, now the Conservatives’ coalition partners. But those savings were tokenistic compared with the much bigger reductions that must be imposed in the next four years. Mr Osborne’s task was to show how the government will make them. </p>\n\n\n  <p>In one sense, that job looks less forbidding than the sound and fury suggests. In cash terms, total spending will be 6% higher in 2014-15 than this year. But that does not take inflation into account: in real terms it will be 3% lower. Moreover, some spending is beyond the chancellor’s control: debt interest is rising from £43 billion this year to £63 billion by 2014-15 as a result of the surge in government borrowing. </p>\n<p>Mr Osborne had two main places to look for savings. The first was the welfare budget, which makes up nearly 30% of all spending. Second, the departments responsible for the public services, which make up around 55% of the total. The more he could find in welfare, the less the squeeze would be for the public services. </p>\n<p>In June the chancellor announced £11 billion of welfare savings (by 2014-15), making it clear that he wanted to find more. In the event he came up with an extra £7 billion. These will come mainly from making working-age benefits for poorer households stingier. The Treasury has left untouched the nearly £4 billion spent annually on perks for people over 60 regardless of their income, who receive winter-fuel payments and free bus travel. But the single biggest cut will come from the controversial removal of child benefit from families with a higher-rate taxpayer from 2013. The chancellor now reckons this will save £2.5 billion a year, a lot more than the figure of £1 billion (which looked strangely low) that he gave at the Tory party conference on October 4th.</p>\n<p>He was also able to find another £3.5 billion of savings outside the departmental budgets. Half of this will come from raising the contribution rates of employees into public-sector pension schemes, as Lord Hutton, a former Labour minister, recently recommended. The Treasury reckons that this will save £1.8 billion by 2014-15. In a move that has infuriated retailers it will raise another £1 billion by keeping (rather than recycling) revenues raised by a scheme to reduce carbon emissions through greater energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>By making these additional savings, Mr Osborne was able to soften the blow on departmental budgets—but they are still taking a big hit. The cash devoted to the public services—the “departmental expenditure limits”—will have to drop by 11% in real terms by 2014-15 (see chart above). </p>\n\n<p>That pain will fall unevenly. The smallish international-development budget will carry on rising sharply, because of the pledge to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid from 2013. More important, the commitment to ring-fence the huge NHS budget (second only to the welfare bill) from real reductions has meant a much bigger squeeze for other departments (see chart right). </p>\n<p>Some of those have got off more lightly than others. After a ferocious battle, defence will be cut by 7.5%. The education department (which does not cover university funding) will be cut by 11%, mainly through a hefty reduction in its capital spending; its current expenditure will fall in real terms by only 3.4%. Mr Osborne made much of the fact that the schools budget for 5-16-year-olds, including a new “pupil premium” for disadvantaged children worth £2.5 billion by 2014-15, would rise in real terms—by 0.1% a year.</p>\n<p>On the other hand the Home Office, responsible for policing, and the Ministry of Justice, in charge of prisons, each suffer a 25% cut by the end of the parliament. The environment department gets an even bigger cut of 30%. Most notable of all, the Department for Communities and Local Government will have its budget sliced by two-thirds. Grants to local authorities themselves will fall by 27%. </p>\n<p><a name=\"tragedy_or_happy_ending\"></a><br><strong>Tragedy or happy ending?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Despite the suspense ahead of the review, and the bitter struggles involved in setting these budgets, it constituted only the first act of the cuts drama. Whether or not that turns into a tragedy depends upon much else besides dry spending totals. The coalition says the Labour government got less than it should have done for the money it poured into the public services. The hope now is that tight budgets will galvanise genuine improvements in efficiency that make the cuts less painful.</p>\n<p>One obvious way to reduce costs is to keep pay down. The government has already announced a two-year pay freeze for public-sector staff. State employers could carry on in this spirit after that, pointing out that the more pay can be kept down, the fewer the job losses. But job losses there will be, amounting to probably about half a million (out of a workforce of some 6m) by the end of the parliament. </p>\n<p>The government is right that too little was achieved in the way of real reform of the public services under Labour. Its new remedy of dispensing with top-down targets and delegating control may unleash innovation in the way that services are provided, although some in local authorities will no doubt grumble that the sudden enthusiasm for greater local autonomy coincides with slashed budgets. The worry is that the result will instead be tackier public services and a meaner welfare state. </p>","rubric":"The government has specified its spending cuts.

The opposition spokesman must deliver a spontaneous riposte based on a quick reading of a newly published (and highly technical) document produced by his opponent.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Alan Johnson did a manful job denouncing George Osborne’s spending cuts as a threat to economic recovery and low-to-middle earners. Labour’s shadow chancellor is also evolving his own plan, focusing on growth and a more even balance between spending cuts and tax rises than the government’s. </p>\n<p>But as the mutinous streets of France and Greece suggest, resistance to the cuts will not be confined to parliamentary high politics. Indeed, trade unions held a rally against the government’s plans on the eve of the spending review (Ed Miliband, the Labour Party’s leader, who once said he would be there, stayed away to avoid more Conservative cries of “Red Ed”). </p>\n      \n  <p>In the coalition of those opposed to the austerity plan, union bosses stand tall. Among the most militant are Mark Serwotka—head of the Public and Commercial Services union, which looks after civil servants—and Bob Crow, who runs the Rail, Maritime and Transport union. Even the bigger unions such as Unite are more left-wing than their equivalents were a decade ago. Still, the power wielded by unions can be exaggerated. Compared with the era of industrial chaos in the 1970s and 1980s, they have fewer members and more legal restrictions on their capacity to strike. There is also a reluctance among union officials to make life difficult for Mr Miliband: having relied on union votes to win the leadership of his party, he would be embarrassed should strikes infuriate voters.</p>\n<p>Other opponents of the cuts who are perceived to be on the left may also struggle to land hits on the government, as voters could dismiss their grievances as all too predictable. Campaigners for the poor have plenty to complain about. Cuts to housing benefit and social housing could, at a time of high private rents, lead to more homelessness. But the public cite the welfare budget as the one they would most like to see reduced, along with foreign aid. The Arts Council and other victims of cuts in cultural spending will win scant sympathy. And although opponents in the Celtic nations, such as Alex Salmond, Scotland’s nationalist first minister, will trash the Tories and the Liberal Democrats as brutal ogres, English voters will not be listening.</p>\n<p>On recent evidence, the opponents Mr Osborne should most fear are those who are hard to paint as part of a broad Labour-leaning left that had it good for a decade. Senior military figures have—with the help of Liam Fox, the defence secretary—managed to make the budgetary settlement for the armed forces more generous than once seemed likely (see <a href=\"/node/17316591\">article</a> and <a href=\"/node/17307995\">Bagehot</a>). They remain angry, though, at the cutbacks they will have to make, especially those to the navy. </p>\n<p>Police chiefs will also be hard to face down. The Home Office is among those departments bearing the brunt of the cuts, and police pay is being looked at in a separate review. The police cannot strike but they are tenacious resisters of reform. Then there are the councillors, executives and bureaucrats that make up local government. The cuts in this area are ferocious; anger will be felt by Tory and Lib Dem councils, not just Labour ones. </p>\n<p>As he surveys the forces ranged against him, the chancellor may console himself that overall popular opinion—more powerful than any particular interest group—is not overwhelmingly negative (at least, not yet). A YouGov poll on October 18th found that 60% of voters regard the cuts as unavoidable, and 48% blame Labour for them. They also seem braced for the impact; 49% expect public services to get a little worse as a result of the cuts, and 35% expect them to get much worse. Months of bleak talk from ministers has girded voters for the pain to come. The anti-cuts coalition—generals, constables and all—will be much less stoical. </p>","rubric":"The forces ranged against the government’s spending cuts","id":"17316601"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Britain","headline":"A retreat, but not a rout","title":"The strategic defence review","content":"<p>“NO STRATEGIC shrinkage,” David Cameron claimed when he revealed the conclusions of the Strategic Defence and Security Review on October 19th. Others, particularly those in the armed forces told they must make do with much less cash, might beg to differ. The cuts to the defence budget—7.5% in real terms over the next four years—were not as swingeing as was once feared. But thanks in part to the £38 billion- ($60 billion) worth of unfunded defence commitments bequeathed by the previous Labour government, the squeeze will still feel tight.</p>\n<p>Even Mr Cameron was forced to admit that the need to deal with Britain’s fiscal deficit meant that in future Britain’s expeditionary-warfare ambitions would be more modest than in the recent past. With an unspoken dig at Tony Blair, he said Britain’s armed forces would be deployed “only where key UK national interests are at stake…where we have a viable exit strategy; and where justifiable under international law.” However, even with his limited appetite for derring-do, Mr Cameron could not stomach the consequences for Britain’s influence of the much deeper cuts wanted by the Treasury—nor risk losing for ever military capabilities that may be needed 20 years from now. </p>\n<p>The result is that the pain has been evenly spread across the services. British combat troops are expected to stay in Afghanistan until 2015 (Mr Cameron insists that they will have all the support they need), but during that period army manpower will fall to 95,500 from 102,500. The army will also lose nearly half of its tanks and about a third of its biggest artillery guns (most of which are still, anachronistically, in Germany), but will in other ways be better equipped and more mobile. It will be able to keep a 7,000-strong brigade permanently in the field, compared with the 9,500 soldiers now in Afghanistan, and deliver an intervention force of 30,000, a third less than went to Iraq in 2003.</p>\n  <p>The navy and the air force will also see manpower reductions of about 5,000 each, while 25,000 will be cut from the Ministry of Defence’s bloated civilian payroll. The navy’s already stretched destroyer and frigate fleet will be cut from 23 to 19; but it will get seven new Astute-class nuclear-powered attack submarines—and its two new 65,000-tonne aircraft-carriers. </p>\n<p>The carrier decisions are odd if understandable. Cancelling the order for one or both would perversely have cost more than completing them. But the first new carrier will only deploy helicopters and will be held in reserve when the second arrives in 2020. It might even be sold, or, if it were practicable, shared with the French. The second carrier will now be given a catapult, enabling it to host French and American planes and allowing the purchase of a cheaper, better version of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) than the short take-off and vertical landing kind previously ordered. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, given the new carriers’ dominance of the future defence budget, it seems odd that the navy’s flagship <em>Ark Royal</em> and its Harrier jump jets are to be quickly taken out of service, leaving a gap of a decade before its carrier strike capacity is regenerated. Mr Cameron says the Harriers are going because the Tornado, a conventional ground-attack aircraft, has been reprieved as it is deemed to be more useful in Afghanistan. By 2020, the air force will have just two types of fast jet—fighter and strike versions of the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JSF. </p>\n<p>The announcement on Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent is more explicable. By keeping the existing fleet of four ballistic-missile submarines going for a bit longer—the oldest of them will now not come out of service until 2028—the ultimate decision to replace them will be postponed until 2016, saving a useful £1.2 billion. Some will suspect that the main reason for delay is to pander to the Liberal Democrats, who are generally much less keen on maintaining the deterrent than their Conservative coalition partners. </p>\n<p>The review’s assessment of future threats will actually mean more money for a few things. Britain’s special forces, which are much-valued by the Americans, will get better kit, while £650m has been earmarked to beef up defences against cyber-attacks. With international terrorism still identified as the most immediate threat to the country, the intelligence and security services, which have seen their budgets tripled in recent years, will only have to make small “efficiency” savings.</p>\n<p>While there is plenty for critics of this hasty, financially driven review to snipe at, the government had little room for manoeuvre and has made a reasonable fist of a rotten job. Britain will still have the fourth-biggest defence budget in the world and be one of the few NATO countries to meet the alliance’s target for defence spending of 2% of GDP. As Hillary Clinton, the American secretary of state, recognised, Britain remains “the most capable partner for our forces as we seek to mitigate the shared threats of the 21st Century”. There is also scope for making less go further by intensifying the defence relationship with allies, especially the French.</p>\n<p>Critically, Mr Cameron expects defence spending to start growing again in real terms after 2015. Britain may not be quite so gung-ho about throwing itself into every scrap going as it has been, but this review should be seen more as a tactical retreat than a surrender. </p>","rubric":"Britain’s armed forces survive (just about) to fight another day","id":"17316591"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Britain","headline":"Let 'em out and throw away the key","title":"Prison reform","content":"<p>OF THE roughly 100,000 people sentenced to immediate custody in England and Wales each year, around 60,000 are put inside for less than 12 months. Short-stay inmates cost the prison service over £285m a year, not counting education and health care, and on the face of it the taxpayer is not getting value for money. About 60% of them are convicted again within a year of their release; recidivism has remained stubbornly high (see chart below). In the year to March 2008 reoffending by recently released short-termers cost the economy up to £10 billion in lost output, court costs and other charges. </p>\n<p>Small wonder that Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, has long thought there must be a better way. But when he began talking during the summer of sending fewer short-timers to prison, toughening community sentences instead and paying private and voluntary outfits to cut reoffending—in short, of reversing the seemingly inexorable rise of the prison population—he provoked an uproar. </p>\n<p>Feelings about crime and punishment run deep. On one side stand those who are convinced—with a previous Conservative home secretary, Michael Howard, his equally tough-on-crime Labour successors and a big chunk of today’s Tory party—that “prison works”, if only because people don’t mug and steal while they are inside. On the other are those—including rafts of prison reformers and not a few prison governors—who think putting more modest offenders in clink just long enough to lose their jobs or homes but not long enough to conquer drink or drugs is daft. </p>\n  <p>Academic experts are divided. The number of prisoners in England and Wales has almost doubled since 1993, when Mr Howard started stiffening the criminal-justice system. Most sorts of crime have fallen. QED? Not necessarily. Crime rates are influenced by many things, including the long period of almost-full employment that ended recently. And crime dropped in many less punitive countries, too. </p>\n<p>In any case, the cost of locking up more and more people is growing unaffordable. England and Wales have more people in prison per head of population than almost any country in Europe (though, as crime rates are higher too, they still put away fewer people per recorded offence than the European Union average). The overall cost of criminal justice has risen from £11 billion a decade ago to £20 billion, points out Nick Herbert, the reform-minded policing and justice minister. And now the sums are set to change.</p>\n\n<p>The justice ministry, one of the big losers in the spending review this week, will see a quarter lopped off its budget by 2015. Cutting legal aid, closing courts and laying off civil servants—the sacrifices offered by the ministry last month—were not enough. The £4 billion prison-building programme begun by Labour is also to be trimmed, at least one planned new 1,500-place prison deferred, some 11,000 front-line probation and prison officers axed and perhaps 3,000 prison places lost. </p>\n<p>This should bolster Mr Clarke’s case for reform—but it could also descend into cost-cutting chaos. That is mainly because the main alternatives to conventional prison sentences haven’t fully proved their worth.</p>\n<p> The justice ministry gamely insists that community sentences produce lower reoffending rates than short prison sentences, averaging 37% to the latter’s 61%. But the comparisons are not robust: more amenable offenders are often given community sentences, and the crimes that incarceration prevents prisoners from committing are ignored. Blair Gibbs of Policy Exchange, a think-tank, points out that community sentences should clearly involve punishment, yet compliance is a woeful 60% or so (in the Netherlands it is around 80%). And they are often strung out pointlessly: 90 hours of community service, for example, to be carried out over two years. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, tightening and policing these sentences takes money; so would giving more support to prisoners leaving custody and specialised treatment outside prison for vulnerable offenders. Mr Clarke will propose overhauling sentencing and rehabilitation in a green paper due by Christmas. In time, less reoffending should cut prison numbers, release resources and create a virtuous circle of declining crime. But the government cannot just fling open the gates and count the cash. The trick is capturing future savings to invest in rehabilitation now. </p>\n<p>Enter payment by results, the most radical of the government’s proposed prison reforms. Private- and voluntary-sector outfits will be paid only if they succeed in cutting reoffending. In September a “social-impact bond” was launched at Peterborough prison. Investors put up £5m, enlisting charities to ease 3,000 prisoners back into the world. If recidivism falls by 7.5 percentage points or more below predicted rates, the investors might get an annual return of up to 7.5%. Payment by results in criminal justice (it is routine in welfare-to-work) is thought to be a “world first”. </p>\n<p>Mr Clarke hopes to do more of it. With his budget shrinking by 7% a year, and prison places with it, he is going to have to do something. The question is whether the pilot project can be scaled up fast enough to meet the challenge. It is a gamble, and meanwhile ordinary probation services look likely to be squeezed. </p>\n<p>Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, thinks Mr Clarke could learn from Canada’s budget-cutting exercise in the 1990s. While slimming public spending by a fifth, that government trimmed the prison population by 11%, based on a strategic decision to reduce what it saw as the unnecessary use of custody and to invest in community interventions. The country saved money and crime fell for a decade—not a bad outcome. </p>","rubric":"The justice secretary wants to send fewer offenders to prison.

It wants an exemption written into the Freedom Bill, a piece of civil-liberties legislation currently percolating through Parliament, which would protect the right to protest in quasi-public spaces.</p>\n<p>Isabella Sankey of Liberty, a civil-liberties lobby group, admits the issue is tricky: firms are understandably reluctant to see shops disrupted and customers inconvenienced; yet public protests are well-established in Britain’s democratic culture. Now seems like a good time to agitate for a change: the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition has pledged to enhance the rights to peaceful protest that it claims Labour eroded. </p>","rubric":"Are private developers squeezing out demos?","id":"17311869"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Britain","headline":"Romantic small print","title":"Prenuptial agreements","content":"<p>“DIVORCE capital of the world” is just one of London’s claims to fame. Foreigners have learned to their cost that English divorce courts prioritise need over prenuptial agreements. For the richer spouse, that has often meant providing housing and an income for life, and sacrificing assets gained before the marriage. </p>\n<p>Until now, that is. A Supreme Court ruling on October 20th found that a prenuptial agreement, even if it is not drawn up to English legal standards, can count. The case involved a settlement of over £5m that a lower court had ordered to be paid by Katrin Radmacher, a German heiress, to her ex-husband, Nicolas Granatino. Before marrying, the couple had agreed that, in the event of a divorce, neither would make any claim on the other’s assets. Mr Granatino argued that he had no idea then about his wife’s fortune, and had not had proper advice before signing the deal, drawn up by a German lawyer. </p>\n<p>Prenuptial agreements are a booming business, around the world and in England. A survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) found that 73% of its members had seen an increase over the past five years. Joanne Edwards, a partner at Manches, a London law firm, has seen a tenfold rise in that time. </p>\n\n  <p>English divorce law has until now set strict rules for prenuptial deals to be valid (see graphic). The parties must have had independent advice, ruling out the continental practice of using a neutral notary. A cooling-off period of 28 days between signing and nuptials, plus full financial disclosure on both sides, have been required. The divorce must provide fairly for offspring and the poorer spouse. The parties must also update the deal with “post-nups” should circumstances (such as children, retirement or inheritance) change. </p>\n<p>This week’s ruling partially relaxes those criteria, making it easier for spouses, especially rich ones, to rely on agreements that keep specific assets outside a divorce settlement. These might include inherited fortunes (as in Ms Radmacher’s case), a family firm or a prized possession. </p>\n<p>The ruling stops well short of the almost automatic implementation of such deals that is common in continental Europe. Judges will retain the ability to scrutinise the agreements on a case-by-case basis. But the presumption will now be that a prenuptial agreement is fair, unless proved otherwise. In effect, that brings divorce law in England and Wales (Scotland is different) closer to America’s, where prenuptial agreements are routine but can be challenged on grounds of unfairness, deceit, impending destitution or duress. This is long overdue, in the view of Marlene Eskind Moses, president of the AAML: “Given that we speak the same language and share the common law, people would be shocked that a contract entered into freely and knowledgeably, with advice, would not be honoured in England.”</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court’s ruling is only a stop-gap. Some worry about a change based on judges’ rulings in cases involving the mega-rich. The Law Commission, which tidies up the statute book, is planning a consultation paper in the first half of next year. That could lead to a new bill reaching Parliament in 2012, perhaps coming into law in 2014.

In vain his visitor, Britain’s foreign secretary George Brown, rehearsed the domestic pressures weighing on his Labour administration. In a reply unearthed by W. Taylor Fain, a foreign-policy historian, Rusk raged that he could not believe that “free aspirins and false teeth were more important than Britain’s role in the world”.</p>\n<p>The American’s disbelief rings slightly false. Britain had just suffered a sterling devaluation. Like others in western Europe, it had slashed post-war defence spending to pay for a burgeoning welfare state. And yet with his appeal to some primal sense of British duty, Rusk was onto something too. By 1968 pacifism and post-colonial guilt were potent forces across much of western Europe. In contrast, Britain’s Labour leaders felt miserable about their forced retreat from global influence. Fleeing to the British embassy in Washington to cable London, Brown felt “thoroughly sick with myself”. His Britain was a nation that wanted butter, but guns too.</p>\n<p>Four decades on, the cash-strapped government led by David Cameron is taking a bet that Britain still feels that way. Even as the coalition government this week outlined the most painful spending cuts Britain has faced in decades, it went to great lengths to avoid confronting the British public with a direct choice between aspirin and aircraft carriers. The National Health Service has seen its budget ring-fenced, as a (very expensive) token of the coalition’s essential kindliness. But welfare spending is being squeezed. At the same time, Mr Cameron took personal charge of efforts to convince voters that—even after 7.5% cuts to defence spending over the next four years—Britain would still be able to “project power and influence” in a rapidly changing world.</p>\n  <p>The prime minister unveiled a package of defence cuts on October 19th, a day before his chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, announced those affecting the other government departments. The three armed services would shrink, Mr Cameron conceded (so that Britain would no longer be able to deploy forces of the size seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, a largely sceptical press noted). But, he assured the House of Commons, Britain would remain one of a “very few” powers able to deploy a brigade-sized force anywhere on earth, indefinitely. </p>\n<p>Above all, the prime minister attacked the previous Labour government (with reason) for leaving behind a wildly overspent defence budget, complete with unbreakable contracts for two aircraft carriers, one of which the country cannot afford to equip with warplanes. What he did not do was suggest that money saved on defence might be used to offset cuts on civilian spending. In short, guns and butter were kept firmly separate.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons for this. Defence spending is particularly precious to Conservative voters. A Tory prime minister can ill afford public rows with men in uniform. Defence spending is qualitatively different: decisions taken today affect national security for decades to come. Whereas defence is an elite preoccupation in many European countries, in Britain it is the general public that is keen on hard power. Earlier this year, Chatham House, a think-tank, commissioned twin polls of the general public and a group of “elite opinion formers”. Asked to name assets that best served Britain globally, elite respondents named the BBC and British culture. Two-thirds said ethics should at times trump the national interest in British foreign policy. The public put the armed forces joint first with the BBC, called for Britain to remain a “great power” and—by a narrow majority—put national interests ahead of values.</p>\n<p>Actually, there are early signs that Mr Cameron’s foreign-policy doctrine combines hard and soft power. A National Security Strategy made public on October 18th hailed Britain’s military and intelligence services, but also vowed an intense focus on trade promotion. Britain should play to its strengths, it suggested: it was an open, outward-facing hub for the English-speaking world and financial markets, a second home to the restless global elite, a member of the European Union, the Commonwealth, the G8 and the G20 and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Though its spooks should never work with torturers, Britain had to work with countries that did not share its values or standards of criminal justice, the strategy declared. In the interests of national security, Britain might not always indulge in “public condemnation” of such partners.</p>\n<p><a name=\"insular,_or_just_broke\"></a><br><strong>Insular, or just broke?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>So, beneath the bombast, is this a new “east of Suez” moment? The British public does not want one, but it cannot be ruled out, says a senior official. Mr Cameron’s big vulnerability is that the full consequences of his cuts will take years to emerge. When it comes to less muscular forms of influence, the Foreign Office is taking a 26% cut over four years. The BBC World Service will see its Foreign Office funding withdrawn, falling under the general BBC budget: this might harm that global broadcaster.</p>\n<p>To some outsiders, Britain’s obsession with global influence may appear tiresome. But a surly, protectionist Britain would be worse. The fear in official Washington, four decades ago, was that Britain was becoming a “Little England”, walking away from the wider world and leaving America to grapple with its own isolationist temptations. That fear was overblown in 1968: Britain was broke, rather than determined to shun the world. Mr Cameron seems to think the same is true today. Wish him luck. </p>\n\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"David Cameron and George Osborne gamble that Britain wants both guns and butter","id":"17307995"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"International","headline":"The party's (largely) over","title":"Political parties","content":"<p>“WE WORSHIP an awesome God in the blue states,” declared Barack Obama in the speech that made him a star, “and we don’t like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states.” Six years after his address to his party’s national convention in 2004, the idea of Mr Obama as a post-partisan figure, an effortless uniter of Democrats and Republicans, looks droll. </p>\n<p> But his failure to transcend party politics does not mean it was not canny to try. In America, Europe and elsewhere, the era of tight affiliation to political parties is over. Successful politicians surmount party allegiances, rather than entrench them. In America, the “50-50” nation is more like a 30-30-30 nation; last month, a Pew survey found that “independents” at 37% outnumbered either Democrats or Republicans. Such inbetweeners tend to find partisanship on the airwaves and in Congress repellent, strengthening their convictions further.</p>\n\n<p>As old allegiances fade, third parties are doing better. In Germany, a recent poll puts the Greens, formerly a fringe party, ahead of the once impregnable Social Democrats. In Britain’s 1951 general election, 97% of all voters chose Labour or the Conservatives. In last May’s election, just 65% did. Party membership is declining too—by 40% in 13 European democracies between the late 1970s and late 1990s, according to one study. In Britain the three big parties combined have under 500,000 members; in the 1950s, with a smaller population, their total was over 4m. And the members that remain are less active.</p>\n\n  <p>Explanations abound. In many industrial democracies, working-class voters chose left-wing parties out of self-interest. Other voters, fearing the power of organised labour, voted the other way. But when most people count themselves as middle-class, such tribal ties wane. In countries where the ideological gap between parties has narrowed, their brands may no longer be useful labels for busy or ignorant voters. Accustomed to choice as consumers, voters increasingly pick policies rather than signing up to comprehensive world views. Single-issue groups have thrived. Britain’s National Trust, a heritage organisation, raised its membership from 250,000 in 1971 to 3.7m now. </p>\n<p>Political scientists disagree over the causes of the parties’ decline. But a more pressing question is its effects. The decline of partisanship could signal a less tribal, more educated electorate. But research on 36 countries by Professor Paul Whiteley of the University of Essex shows a strong correlation between political partisanship and good public administration. A rise of ten percentage points in partisanship goes along with an increase of one notch in the World Bank’s good-governance table (which assesses countries on a five-point index). A strong party base may help politicians to push through unpopular but necessary reforms. A weak one means that followers flee when the going gets tough.</p>\n<p>Consumer choice may mean dodging responsibility. California’s referendums allow voters to engage with politics issue by issue. The state’s dysfunctional finances and politics are a poor advertisement for that. Less partisanship can also mean more political volatility as big old parties find it harder to win outright. The Westminster model of parliamentary democracy and majoritarian voting should produce strong single-party rule. But the most recent elections in the five main countries that use it (Australia, Britain, Canada, India and New Zealand) have produced hung parliaments. Four have coalition governments.</p>\n<p>The parties’ efforts to reverse this have had little success. As Conservative leader a decade ago (he is now foreign secretary), William Hague proclaimed a target of a million-strong membership. It is now less than 200,000. A better solution may be to give members real power within the party. Maurice Duverger, a French academic, distinguished in 1951 between “cadre” parties, where power is held at the very top, and “mass” parties, where the grassroots decide policy and elect bigwigs. Most political parties in the West offer influence to outsiders who donate money, not to their members who donate time. </p>\n\n<p>The decline of partisanship is prompting some innovations. Some Americans favour the idea of “top two” primary elections in which any registered voter can take part, and choose two candidates, regardless of party, to contest an election. The victors could be two Democrats or two Republicans. The system is already in effect in Washington state and was recently approved in California. It could help cross-party and moderate candidates. But it faces a stiff legal challenge. </p>\n\n<p>Other efforts seek to turn independent politicians—often seen as cranks and amateurs—into effective candidates. In Britain, outfits such as Independent Network and the Jury Team offer training and support to independents. Brian Ahearne, director of the Independent Network, says that Britain’s most recent general election saw the biggest number of independents standing for election since 1885, when records began, and almost twice as many as stood in 2005. They received over 144,000 votes, against a mere 10,000 in 1987. </p>\n<p>Politicians like to have it both ways. “Vote for my Daddy,” quavers Ben Lange’s toddler daughter, in a spot for his candidacy in an Iowan congressional race. Grouped with his family on a sunny mid-western hillside, Mr Lange gives a wide berth to party politics. “This isn’t about Republican/Democrat,” is his cutesy patter. But another campaign video on his website is bombastic and combative, showing grainy footage of political foes, with a sinister musical soundtrack. The old system may be broken.

Finding the causes is harder. Medical professionals in Britain know that Hammersmith Hospital in west London, for example, is one of the best in the country—Tony Blair received treatment there for his irregular heartbeat and it is one of only a handful of places to which London ambulance crews take people with suspected heart attacks. From America to Sweden, the best hospitals in a rich country outperform the rest. But how?</p>\n<p>Stephen Dorgan of McKinsey, a consultancy, and John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics have tried to answer this. They studied almost 1,200 hospitals in America, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden, using techniques more commonly applied to identify excellence in manufacturing industry. </p>\n<p>The hospitals with the best management practices (analysed as if they made things rather than curing people) also ranked best on a standardised measure of medical success: death rates among emergency patients experiencing heart attacks. That score works across countries and cultures, and has unambiguous results.</p>\n  <p>The researchers found five characteristics associated with the management of successful hospitals. One was competition—or at least the perception of having competitors. Hospital managers who named more than ten institutions that they competed with scored more highly on their management practice than those who saw fewer alternatives for their patients to choose from.</p>\n<p>Having lots of small providers vying for patients will not on its own raise standards. The researchers also found that bigger is better when it came to good management. Hospitals employing 1,500 or more staff are better run than those employing more than 500, which, in turn, outperform those with more than 100 staff. Hospitals with less than 100 people working in them are particularly badly managed. Private ownership is another factor helping hospitals score more highly. </p>\n<p>Only in Italy must hospital managers have clinical degrees. That seems a good rule: institutions that employ clinically qualified staff in management score better than those that do not. Overall, Britain performs badly by this measure: in Sweden, 93% of hospital managers are former doctors, nurses or other clinical staff. In America, Canada and Germany, the proportion is 71-74%. In France it is 64%, and in Britain just 58%. Good staff also need the freedom to exercise their own judgment: managers with the most autonomy fare best.</p>\n<p>That may be a signpost for improvement. Hammersmith Hospital is one of five such institutions run by Imperial College, London. Stephen Smith, who is responsible for the hospitals, is also principal of the faculty of medicine. In America, Johns Hopkins is not merely a highly rated university based in Baltimore, but its medical arm also runs a hospital of high repute.

Whereas Google has hurried to scan books into its digital catalogue, a group of national libraries has begun saving what the online giant leaves behind. For although search engines such as Google index the web, they do not archive it. Many websites just disappear when their owner runs out of money or interest. Adam Farquhar, in charge of digital projects for the British Library, points out that the world has in some ways a better record of the beginning of the 20th century than of the beginning of the 21st.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Brewster Kahle, a computer scientist and internet entrepreneur, founded the Internet Archive, a non-profit organisation dedicated to preserving websites. He also began gently harassing national libraries to worry about preserving the web. They started to pay attention when several elections produced interesting material that never touched paper.</p>\n<p>In 2003 eleven national libraries and the Internet Archive launched a project to preserve “born-digital” information: the kind that has never existed as anything but digitally. Called the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), it now includes 39 large institutional libraries. But the task is impossible. One reason is the sheer amount of data on the web. The groups have already collected several petabytes of data (a petabyte can hold roughly 10 trillion copies of this article). </p>\n  <p>Another issue is ensuring that the data is stored in a format that makes it available in centuries to come. Ancient manuscripts are still readable. But much digital media from the past is readable only on a handful of fragile and antique machines, if at all. The IIPC has set a single format, making it more likely that future historians will be able to find a machine to read the data. But a single solution cannot capture all content. Web publishers increasingly serve up content-rich pages based on complex data sets. Audio and video programmes based on proprietary formats such as Windows Media Player are another challenge. What happens if Microsoft is bankrupt and forgotten in 2210?</p>\n<p>The biggest problem, for now, is money. The British Library estimates that it costs half as much to store a digital document as it does a physical one. But there are a lot more digital ones. America’s Library of Congress enjoys a specific mandate, and budget, to save the web. The British Library is still seeking one. </p>\n<p>So national libraries have decided to split the task. Each has taken responsibility for the digital works in its national top-level domain (web-address suffixes such as “.uk” or “.fr”). In countries with larger domains, such as Britain and America, curators cannot hope to save everything. They are concentrating on material of national interest, such as elections, news sites and citizen journalism or innovative uses of the web.</p>\n<p>The daily death of countless websites has brought a new sense of urgency—and forced libraries to adapt culturally as well. Past practice was to tag every new document as it arrived. Now precision must be sacrificed to scale and speed. The task started before standards, goals or budgets are set. And they may yet change. Just like many websites, libraries will be stuck in what is known as “permanent beta”.</p>","rubric":"National libraries start to preserve the web, but cannot save everything","id":"17306104"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"International","headline":"Unbendable","title":"New Roman Catholic cardinals","content":"<p>WHEN John Paul II, the first non-Italian pontiff since 1523, was elected in 1978 it was seen as a sign that the church was belatedly making good its claim to be catholic, or universal. Italians were unconvinced; some called the reign of the former Karol Wojtyla the “Polish exception”. But when a German was named to succeed him, it seemed even to many Italians that their grip on the papacy had been broken.</p>\n<p> On October 20th Pope Benedict XVI seemed to assuage Italian gloom. He announced the names of 24 new cardinals, including 20 below the age of 80 who will thus get the right to vote in a papal election. Eight of the cardinal-electors are from Italy. Once they receive their red hats on November 20th, some 25 of the 120 voting cardinals will be Italians; it looks highly possible that one of them will be chosen to succeed the 83-year-old Benedict.</p>\n<p> That may have advantages: John Paul neglected the papal administration, the Curia, which badly needs modernising. Benedict has tried twice to simplify the Curia but been thwarted each time. A local with a feeling for Italian culture might outwit the foot-draggers.</p>\n  <p> Still, Benedict’s appointments look anachronistic. Only seven of his new cardinals come from Latin America, Africa or Asia. Between them, according to the church’s own data, those regions account for some two-thirds of baptised Catholics. The new men will at least be electors, though. And one, Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, from Congo, has been called <em>papabile</em>, a potential pope.</p>\n<p>But while elevating some Italians from rather modest roles, Benedict passed over the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro who cares for more than 3.5m souls.

The two new American cardinals are at opposite ends of a spectrum: Raymond Burke called for pro-abortion politicians to be denied communion while Donald Wuerl rejected that line. </p>\n<p>In ignoring some important prelates, Benedict has kept to the unwritten rule that diocesan archbishops do not become cardinals if their predecessors are still voting red-hats.

Yet Turkey has managed the trick in less than one. Ten years ago it was a basket-case. Its economy was both sclerotic and erratic, its banks were bust, and inflation was dizzyingly high. It was forever calling in the International Monetary Fund for help (Turkey has run up some 18 IMF programmes, a near-record). Politics was also worryingly unstable. Even though the country was an established democracy, a string of weak and short-lived coalition governments alternated with the occasional coup staged by a powerful army. </p>\n<p>As a member of NATO that was for many years on the front-line of the cold war, Turkey was at least a reliable ally of the West. But its regional influence in 2000 was almost as feeble as its economy. The Turks insisted that they wanted to join the European Union, but they had made almost no progress. Just over a decade ago they were humiliatingly overtaken in the race to be EU candidates by the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>Yet ten years on Turkey stands transformed. The economy suffered badly in the global recession of 2009, but over the previous five years it had been unusually vigorous, and it has bounced back so quickly that this year it is likely to grow faster than those of almost all other European countries. Turkey has largely escaped the Mediterranean sickness that has taken hold in Greece, Spain, Portugal and even Italy. It is on the verge of acquiring an investment-grade credit rating, inflation is in single figures and the government has been able to dump the IMF. </p>\n      \n  <p>The political situation has also greatly improved. After nearly eight years of single-party rule by Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development (AK) party, the army has been largely tamed. With exquisite timing, Mr Erdogan won a referendum on constitutional changes to increase his control of the army and judiciary on September 12th, the anniversary of a 1980 military coup. The AK government has pushed through an impressive array of political and economic reforms. One reward was the formal opening in October 2005 of negotiations for EU membership.</p>\n<p><a name=\"pillar_of_the_international_community\"></a><br><strong>Pillar of the international community</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These changes have not gone unnoticed. Turkey is now a vocal member of the G20 club of important economies. It held a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2009-10. It is knocking on the door of the BRICs club of emerging giants. Some forecasts suggest that during the next decade it will grow faster than any country bar India and China. Others predict it could become the world’s tenth-biggest economy by 2050. </p>\n<p>That is partly because of Turkey’s favourable demographic outlook. The average age of its 72m people is only 29, against over 40 in the EU. By 2050 its population will have risen to almost 100m. If by then Turkey has managed to get into the EU, it will be its most populous member, far ahead of Germany, which will have a mere 70m people. </p>\n<p>But there is more to Turkey than a flourishing economy and a young population. Whereas ten years ago it seemed a peripheral country, now it has become a pivotal one. Its geographical position, wedged between the European landmass, Russia and the Middle East, has given it a new strategic importance, especially in the energy-pipeline business. And its newly assertive foreign policy is making it count not just in neighbouring countries but as far afield as China and Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Turkey has an especially significant place in the Muslim world. Thanks to the legacy of Ataturk, it is a rare example among Muslim countries of a functioning secular democracy. Compared with much of the Arab world, it has been hugely successful in economic, diplomatic and military terms. A Turk currently serves as secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. And since his country’s diplomatic spat with Israel earlier this year Mr Erdogan has become a hero to the Arab street. Many Arabs compare him favourably with their own gerontocratic (and undemocratic) rulers. </p>\n<p><a name=\"trouble_spots\"></a><br><strong>Trouble spots</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In short, Turkey matters today in a way that few would have thought possible a decade ago. Indeed, in some ways it counts for more than when the Ottoman empire was crumbling a century ago and Turkey was widely known as the “sick man of Europe”. And yet there are persistent blemishes on its seemingly bright prospects.</p>\n<p>One is the Kurdish question, of which more later. As it happens, the AK government has done more than almost any of its predecessors to give a better deal to Turkey’s Kurds, who make up 14% of the population, most of them living in the country’s poor south-east. But Kurdish PKK guerrillas stepped up their terrorist campaign earlier this year and the precarious ceasefire that is now in force may not last.</p>\n<p>A second is that the economy, for all its recent strength, is still a work in progress. Inflation is not wholly defeated, the current-account deficit is large and Turkey’s competitiveness in manufacturing is a matter for concern. Worst of all, unemployment is distressingly high, especially in the east and south-east and among women and the young. These failings will be analysed in more detail in the next section of this report.</p>\n<p>A rapidly growing country inevitably has social problems to contend with as well. On the UN Development Programme’s human-development index, a general measure of wellbeing, Turkey comes below Russia, Albania and Romania. Despite some excellent universities and hospitals, the quality of education and health care is patchy and uneven. Moreover, corruption is a huge problem. The corruption rankings of Transparency International, a Berlin-based lobby group, put Turkey behind South Africa and on a par with Cuba.</p>\n<p>And then there is Turkish politics. The AK government has done well since it took office in 2002. The party dislikes labels, yet the term “mildly Islamist” suits it, as does “conservative”. Mr Erdogan himself likens AK to a European Christian Democratic party. There is no longer a serious danger of a military coup. But despite his victory in September’s referendum, Mr Erdogan faces a tricky election next summer. His authoritarian streak has attracted much criticism, and the main opposition party has begun to revitalise itself under a new leader. The AK party may yet win another majority, but there is also a chance that it will fall short and Turkey could find itself with a coalition government for the first time since 2002.</p>\n<p>Turkey’s experience of the past few decades suggests that the country needs firm external anchors to stop it drifting into dangerous waters. It has depended on two in particular. The first is the IMF: whenever the economy has veered off course, the IMF has been called in to drag it back. The most dramatic instance came after the crisis of 2001, when Kemal Dervis took over as finance minister and, with the help of the IMF, devised the fiscal and monetary framework that was largely responsible for the country’s subsequent success. </p>\n<p>The second and even weightier anchor has been the lure of EU membership. Whereas the IMF has steered only Turkey’s macroeconomic policy, the EU has been the catalyst for an entire programme of social and economic reforms. Even before membership talks began in October 2005, the EU was able to persuade Turkey to adopt a wide-ranging liberal, free-market and democratic agenda.</p>\n<p>The problem with both anchors is that over the past five years their pull has got much weaker. A healthier economy and stronger public finances have enabled Turkey to jettison its IMF programme (though some ministers tried to keep it). In the run-up to a possibly tight election next year, this may make it easy for the government to offer irresponsible fiscal inducements that could jeopardise the long-term health of the public finances. </p>\n<p>Even more disturbing is the loss of EU influence. Few people, either in Brussels or in Ankara, any longer believe that Turkish membership will come about in the foreseeable future. The negotiations have progressed agonisingly slowly. Over half the chapters in the accession talks are now blocked, many because of an unresolved dispute over Cyprus. Political leaders as well as voters in France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands have made it clear that they do not want Turkey in the EU. </p>\n<p>So it is not surprising that many Turks consider that the EU anchor has lost its purchase. The country’s political leaders these days speak less and less about their EU aspirations. Why should Turkey implement difficult reforms to meet European standards, some ask plaintively, if EU membership will not be forthcoming in return? Indeed, why continue on the path of free-market liberal democracy at all?</p>\n<p>That is the kernel of Turkey’s difficulties today. So long as it could rely on the IMF’s tutelage and had a real hope of EU membership, its course was fixed. But with the IMF gone and the EU receding over the horizon, Turkey needs new anchors. The best place to start looking is the economy—for without continuing economic success, not much else will go right. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"Turkey has made astonishing progress in the past decade, says John Peet.

After a wretched 1990s Turkey suffered an economic meltdown in 2000-01. GDP shrank by almost 6%, the lira collapsed, most of the banks had to be rescued and the IMF was called in (again). Since the cost of rescuing the banks amounted to almost one-third of GDP, the public debt shot up from around 38% to 74% of national income. The experience was painful, but at least it left Turkey better prepared than other countries when the next crisis struck seven years later.</p>\n<p>That was largely thanks to Mr Dervis, a World Bank economist who became Turkey’s finance minister in March 2001. Besides rescuing the banks, he devised a new framework for Turkish monetary and fiscal policy. When the AK party came to power in November 2002, much of the hard work of repairing Turkey’s battered economy had already been done. Sensibly enough, the new finance minister, Ali Babacan, continued with these policies.</p>\n\n<p>The results have been spectacular. In the 1990s Turkey’s GDP grew by an annual average of just 4%. In 2002-08 that rose to an average of about 6% before the recession hit in 2009 (see chart 1). Inflation, running at an average of 75% a year in the 1990s, is down to 9% today. The public debt is back below 50% of GDP. The banks have been transformed. Suzan Sabanci Dincer, chairman of the biggest, Akbank, notes that tough regulation after the 2000-01 crisis lifted the capital ratio to a dizzying 19% and pushed down the loan-leverage ratio to below the EU’s or America’s. The number of banks has fallen from 79 to 49.</p>\n      \n  <p>When the OECD published a report on the Turkish economy in September, its secretary-general, Ángel Gurría, said that Turkey would be the organisation’s fastest-growing member this year and likened its performance to that of the emerging-market BRICs. Some economists suggest that over the next seven years Turkey’s growth will match or exceed that of any other big country except China and India.</p>\n\n<p>The markets have taken note of Turkey’s rapid growth and prudent economic and financial management. When the latest crisis hit Europe, credit-default swap spreads rose sharply for countries such as Greece, Hungary, Portugal and Spain, yet they barely budged for Turkey. Indeed, this summer Turkey was able to boast a CDS spread below that of Italy, a G7 economy (see chart 2). Turkey is now on the verge of achieving an investment-grade rating for the first time. Foreign investors have begun to see it as a good thing. In the 1990s foreign direct investment was running at less than $1 billion a year, but ten years later, before the crisis briefly sent it back down again, it was closer to $20 billion.</p>\n<p><a name=\"anatolian_tigers\"></a><br><strong>Anatolian tigers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Turkish entrepreneurs have responded splendidly to the new opportunities created by a stronger economy. Curiously for a place that has such industrious people, Turkey does not have an especially good record in business. In Ottoman times the Armenians, Greeks and Jews were responsible for most of the country’s commerce. Proud Turks either served in the army or farmed. But that has changed.</p>\n<p>These days Turkish firms are leading lights in many manufacturing industries, notably in construction, furniture, textiles, food-processing and carmaking. Unlike finance, which has largely stayed in Istanbul, such businesses have tended to develop most in fast-growing Anatolian cities such as Bursa, Kayseri and Konya. Their bosses help to form a backbone of support for the AK party.</p>\n<p>Umit Boyner, head of TUSIAD, the Turkish employers’ federation, stresses the country’s strong financial sector and its big exporters of textiles, cars and in agribusiness. John McCarthy at ING, a Dutch bank, suggests that foreign investment has made all of Turkish business more competitive. Turkey is now the world’s biggest cement exporter and second-biggest jewellery exporter. Its construction order book is surpassed only by China’s. It is Europe’s leading maker of televisions and DVD players and its third-biggest maker of motor vehicles. English-speakers may laugh at firms with names such as Koc and Arcelik, but Turkish multinationals like Enka construction, Turkcell, Calik Holding and, yes, Koc are growing fast. So is Turkish Airlines. Find a building site anywhere in the former Soviet Union or across the Middle East, and you will find Turkish suppliers and companies—and Turkish workers, too.</p>\n<p>Yet not everything is blooming in Turkey’s economic garden. The dumping of the IMF programme in 2009 left fiscal policy adrift. Mehmet Simsek, the finance minister, wanted to retain the IMF at the time, but Mr Babacan, who is now deputy prime minister, points out that none of Turkey’s previous IMF programmes was ever completed (even Mr Dervis’s was interrupted by the 2002 election). He suggests that it is better for Turkey to be directly responsible for its own fiscal strategy. Mr Simsek has drawn up medium-term fiscal rules that aim to bring the budget deficit back below 3% of GDP within the next two years, but the finance ministry has delayed their implementation until some time next year—after the election.</p>\n<p>Turkey suffers from two other bugbears: inflation and a large current-account deficit. Mr Simsek claims that today’s 9% inflation rate is in large part due to temporary factors that will fall away next year. The current-account deficit is more worrying because it suggests that competitiveness is steadily eroding. Mr Simsek acknowledges a shortfall in domestic savings that will be hard to correct. But on Turkey’s bond rating he remains bullish: “Turkey is the largest convergence story in this time-zone, and maybe in the world.”</p>\n<p>Even so the government needs to get more serious about deregulation and structural reform. As the OECD report says, “higher employment and productivity growth will not be possible without profound regulatory reform.” In 2010 Turkey came 73rd out of 183 countries in the World Bank’s annual “ease of doing business” rankings. Within the OECD, it comes last or second-last for restrictive product-market regulation, excessive state control and barriers to entrepreneurship.</p>\n\n<p>All this shows up in perhaps Turkey’s most serious economic problem: chronic unemployment (see chart 3). Mr Babacan talks up the creation of 1.5m new jobs in the shadow of the world recession during 2009-10. Unemployment has fallen sharply this year, but it still stands above 10%, and among the young, the unskilled and in the east it is much higher. Women are vastly underused: among those of working age only 26% are in employment, down from 34% in the late 1980s, leaving a large gap between male and female employment rates. This cannot be entirely explained by cultural factors in a mainly Muslim country. After all, Turkey has quite a few women in senior positions in business—such as TUSIAD’s Ms Boyner.</p>\n<p>Polls show that unemployment is a big worry for Turks. A Eurobarometer poll in October 2009 found 63% saying it was the most important issue facing the country. Mr Babacan and Mr Simsek have responded with a new employment strategy. But the labour market is too rigid: minimum wages are too high and do not allow enough regional variation, and temporary labour contracts are discouraged. One consequence is a large black economy, which also keeps the tax take low.</p>\n<p><a name=\"cheap_isn%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99t_cheerful\"></a><br><strong>Cheap isn’t cheerful</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Further ahead loom potentially troubling structural weaknesses. Much of Turkey’s recent success has rested on relatively low labour costs, compared with a higher-cost European market. Yet as the country has already found with textiles, there is almost always another source that can offer even lower labour costs. China and India have become big threats to much of Turkey’s low-skilled industry.</p>\n<p>Both government and industry recognise that the best way forward is to move upmarket. Strenuous efforts have been made to improve schools and universities and promote high technology. The results are already in evidence. In 1990 only 15% of Turkey’s exports were in medium- or high-tech sectors, according to Fatma Melek, chief economist at Akbank. Today, the figure is almost 40%. Yet Turkey spends only 0.7% of its GDP on research and development, compared with an OECD average of 2.3%. And with almost a quarter of the workforce in agriculture, overall productivity remains low.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is to find fresh markets. Traditionally Turkey has relied mainly on the West, especially Germany and the rest of Europe. But although the EU is still Turkey’s biggest market by far, its share is falling. In 2002 it took 56% of Turkish exports; this year the figure will drop below 50%. At the same time the share of exports going to the Middle East has doubled, from 9% to 18%. Exports to Iran and Syria together are now worth more than exports to the United States.</p>\n<p>The importance of this shift goes far beyond the economic gains of access to more diversified markets. As Turkish businessmen fan out across the Middle East and renew contacts in the old Turkic world (which stretches from Turkey through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and as far as Xinjiang in China), they are helping to underpin a stronger presence in a region that Turkey largely ignored for many years. That reflects a significant shift in Turkish foreign policy—one with which some in the West are far from comfortable. </p>","rubric":"The economy has had a big boost from much sounder management","id":"17276384"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"The Davutoglu effect","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>TURKISH foreign policy used to be simple. Ever since Ataturk dragged the country into the modern world by driving out the sultan, adopting the Latin alphabet and abolishing the Muslim caliphate, the country has leant westwards. Since the second world war that has meant joining NATO (in 1952), backing the West against the Soviet Union and aspiring to join the European project. Like America, Turkey was also consistently pro-Israel. </p>\n<p>It largely ignored the rest of its region, which includes most of the countries that were once part of the Ottoman empire. In his book “The New Turkish Republic”, Graham Fuller, a former CIA analyst and academic, recalls telling a Turkish friend that he was a Middle East expert, only to be asked, “so why are you in Turkey?” In similar vein, Turkish diplomats would tell their Western friends that “we live in a bad neighbourhood” and that “the Turk’s only friend is another Turk.”</p>\n<p>Over the past few years all this has changed. Rather than feeling sorry for itself over its rough surroundings and lack of friends, Turkey has a new policy of “zero problems with the neighbours”. It is no longer carping at Armenia over its allegations of genocide in 1915 or reproaching the Arab world for its British-supported “stab in the back” in 1917-18. Instead it is cultivating new friendships in the region, offering trade, aid and visa-free travel. And far from backing Israel militarily and diplomatically, Turkey has become a leading critic.</p>\n\n      \n  <p>The man largely responsible for engineering this dramatic shift is Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey’s foreign minister since 2009. Before that he was an international-relations adviser to Mr Erdogan. In 2001, before the AK government came to power, Mr Davutoglu published a book, “Strategic Depth”, that set out a new policy of engagement with the region. He rejects accusations that he is “neo-Ottoman”, yet his doctrine certainly involves rebuilding ties round the former Ottoman empire.</p>\n<p>Mr Davutoglu is an engaging, bookish character with a formidable knowledge of history. He thinks that Turkey made a mistake by ignoring its backyard for so long, and he is convinced that its new strategy of asserting its interests, both in the region and in the world, makes his country more, not less, attractive to the West. Nothing infuriates him more than articles in Western publications suggesting that Turkey has tilted east, or even claiming that “we have lost Turkey.” “Who is we?” he asks. After all, Turkey maintains NATO’s biggest army after America’s; it is committed in Afghanistan and other trouble spots; and it is negotiating to join the EU. As Mr Davutoglu puts it, “Turkey is not an issue; it is an actor.” His country now matters more than ever to Europe and the West, he claims.</p>\n<p>Certainly Mr Davutoglu’s new policy in the region is paying dividends. In Iraq, for instance, Turkey has strong commercial and diplomatic interests. At one time the Kurdish region of northern Iraq was a big headache, but now Turkey is playing a lead role in stabilising the place—and winning co-operation from both the region and Baghdad against the PKK. Its relations with Syria, for many years a problem country for the West, are flourishing as never before. It has even sought to forge closer diplomatic ties with the still more problematic Islamic republic of Iran, much to America’s annoyance.</p>\n<p>Turkey is also active again in its old stamping-ground in the Balkans, especially in Bosnia and Kosovo. Greek-Turkish relations, which improved markedly even before the AK party came to power in 2002, remain broadly harmonious, although Cyprus is still a point of friction. The country is also paying more attention to Africa; it has opened or is planning to open 12 new embassies there.</p>\n<p>The Turks have even made a partial attempt at reconciliation with Armenia, a process begun when President Abdullah Gul visited Yerevan in late 2008 to attend a football match. After the visit the two sides signed bilateral protocols to normalise relations and reopen the land border, closed during Armenia’s war with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh in the early 1990s. But thanks mainly to Mr Erdogan’s insistence on linking the protocols to progress on the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, the protocols have yet to be ratified.</p>\n<p>Turkey has also made the most of being an energy corridor between east and west. As a substantial energy importer with a fast-growing commercial relationship with Russia, it has a direct interest in the matter. But a decade of confrontation over oil and, especially, gas between Russia and the West has taught all sides to value Turkey as a buffer. Oil and gas pipelines already snake across Turkey from Azerbaijan via Georgia. And the Turks have signed up to the ambitious Nabucco gas-pipeline project, intended to bypass Russia—though plenty of Russians ask where the gas for Nabucco will come from. Energy diplomacy often comes to naught, but it will be hard to ignore Turkey in any future deals.</p>\n<p>Mr Babacan, the deputy prime minister, says it is right for Turkey to have a sense of global responsibility. He and Mr Davutoglu also like to tell their European counterparts that, by playing a more active role in its region, including in the Balkans, Turkey is demonstrating how valuable it would be as a member of the EU.</p>\n<p>Yet Mr Davutoglu and Mr Babacan are being somewhat disingenuous. Certainly Turkey’s influence in its region allows it to lay claim to being an interesting and potentially useful partner. But as it has also found, the Middle East is such a complex place that its policy of zero problems with the neighbours cannot be sustained all of the time. Nor is it easy to maintain a friendly dialogue both with the West and with the West’s enemies.</p>\n<p><a name=\"freelance_diplomacy\"></a><br><strong>Freelance diplomacy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Iran is a prime example. Since it is a neighbour, a big oil and gas producer and an increasingly significant trade partner, the Turks have strong reasons to seek better relations with it. That is one reason why, along with the Brazilians, the Turks tried their own freelance nuclear diplomacy with Iran earlier this year. It is also why they are naturally averse to tougher trade sanctions against Iran, let alone any suggestion of war.</p>\n<p>Yet Iranian nuclear diplomacy is both delicate and fiendishly complicated. The Turkish-Brazilian plan, when it emerged, seemed softer on Iran than any put forward by Western negotiators. When, soon afterwards, a resolution to tighten sanctions came before the UN Security Council in June, Turkey decided to vote against it to keep its dialogue with Iran going (though Mr Davutoglu claims to have used his diplomatic influence to persuade Lebanon to abstain and Bosnia to vote in favour). Not surprisingly, the Americans were furious.</p>\n<p>Israel is an even better illustration of the problems inherent in Turkey’s new foreign policy. In May a Turkish-led civilian flotilla led by the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> attempted to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. Gaza has been an especially sore point in Turkey ever since Israel’s invasion in January 2009—not least because the Turks were deep into shuttle diplomacy to open peace talks between Syria and Israel just when the attack on Gaza began. Shortly afterwards Mr Erdogan walked off a platform he was sharing with the Israeli president, Shimon Peres, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, shouting that Israel certainly knew how to kill people.</p>\n<p>When the Israeli army intercepted the Turkish flotilla in international waters, its soldiers were surprised to be physically attacked on the <em>Mavi Marmara</em>. They retaliated by opening fire, killing eight Turkish citizens and one man who held joint Turkish and American citizenship. The Turks were outraged. Mr Davutoglu says this is the first time in the history of Ataturk’s republic that unarmed civilians have been killed by the armed forces of another country. Mr Erdogan and Mr Davutoglu demanded a UN-led inquiry and an Israeli apology. In September the UN human-rights council duly criticised Israel, but the Israelis rejected its findings and have refused to apologise. Mr Davutoglu insists that relations with Israel can never be the same again.</p>\n<p>Yet this will come at a cost. The Israelis are not popular with many people these days, but they still have friends in Washington, DC. By making Gaza a centrepiece of its foreign policy and even more by openly sympathising with Hamas, which runs Gaza, Turkey has gained new friends in the Arab world but alienated allies in the West. Indeed, it was the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> incident and the Turkish response to it that led to an outpouring of comments that the West was losing Turkey. There could be more serious consequences. For instance, America’s Congress is now more likely to adopt a resolution condemning the Armenian genocide of 1915 which is put forward every year but which the Turks have so far managed to prevent going through.</p>\n<p>The mercurial Mr Erdogan does not make it any easier for Turkey to conduct a coherent foreign policy, as demonstrated by the Davos incident and by his torpedoing of the Armenian deal. In 2004-05 he twice came close to jeopardising Turkey’s chances of opening membership negotiations with the EU. Semih Idiz, a journalist with <em>Milliyet</em> newspaper, jokes of Turkish foreign policy: “Davutoglu makes, Erdogan breaks and Gul picks up the pieces.”</p>\n<p>Turkish public opinion adds another layer of complication. Ordinary Turks now have a strikingly low opinion of America. In 2000, according to the Pew Global Attitudes Project, some 52% of Turks thought well of America, a smaller share than in Germany and Britain but about the same as in Spain. The Iraq war changed this, especially after the Turkish parliament voted in March 2003 not to let the Americans move troops across Turkey for a possible second front. By 2007, thanks mainly to the war, less than 10% of Turks had a favourable opinion of America. That figure has ticked up since Barack Obama became president, but it is still lower than in the rest of Europe. A recent survey by the German Marshall Fund found that approval ratings for Mr Obama too have fallen sharply, from 50% in 2009 to 28% this year.</p>\n<p>In Europe, Turkey’s new foreign policy has often gone down no better than in America. Mr Davutoglu and his colleagues argue that Turkey’s diplomatic ventures in its region and elsewhere, like its crucial role in energy and its military prowess, underline how useful Turkey could be as a member of the EU. But that is not how opponents of Turkish membership see it.</p>\n<p>Those opponents were cheered both by Turkey’s bungling in Iran and by the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> incident. In their view, these events prove that Turkey is too ready to wander off the West’s reservation and pander to Islamist extremists—and not at all ready for solidarity with the EU’s common foreign policy. The EU, they argue, cannot accommodate an aspiring global player with interests so different from Europe’s, especially one so big. That argument has grown more resonant as Turkey’s membership negotiations have stalled. </p>","rubric":"All change for foreign policy","id":"17276420"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"A fading European dream","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>TURKEY’S involvement with the European project has a long and chequered history. The country expressed interest in a link with the original six-strong European Economic Community as far back as 1959, the first non-member to do so. In 1963 it signed an association agreement with the EEC. Walter Hallstein, a German Christian Democrat who was the first president of the European Commission, hailed this as explicit recognition that “Turkey is a part of Europe.” Sadly that view is not shared by many in his party today.</p>\n<p>The Turks did not formally seek membership until 1987, when the ebullient Turgut Ozal, a modernising prime minister and European enthusiast, submitted an application even though he had been warned off doing so. The European Commission advised against it in 1989. Turkey’s dreadful 1990s put paid to any idea of reviving it quickly. Instead a later prime minister, Tansu Ciller, negotiated a customs union with the EU that took effect in 1996, securing unfettered access to the European single market for the first time.</p>\n<p>By then the newly liberated countries of eastern Europe were also queuing up to join. At an EU summit in December 1997 European leaders decided to invite no fewer than ten countries from eastern Europe, plus Cyprus and Malta, to open membership negotiations. Turkey was left out. Turkish generals started to mutter that they might have done better in Brussels if they had joined the Warsaw Pact, not NATO.</p>\n      \n  <p>European leaders made amends two years later by declaring that “Turkey is a candidate state destined to join the union on the basis of the same criteria as applied to other candidate states.” When the AK government took power in 2002 it proclaimed its goal of EU accession, just as its predecessor had done. And it passed enough reforms to persuade EU leaders unanimously to agree to begin membership talks in October 2005.</p>\n<p><a name=\"keep_your_promises\"></a><br><strong>Keep your promises</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sadly, despite diplomats’ doctrine of <em>pacta sunt servanda</em> (treaties and promises should be kept), that has proved the high point of Turkey’s European dream. In Germany the Christian Democrat Angela Merkel was about to replace the Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder as chancellor. Less than two years later Nicolas Sarkozy took over from Jacques Chirac as French president. Mrs Merkel has long opposed Turkish EU membership, advocating a “privileged partnership” instead. Mr Sarkozy has consistently opposed Turkish entry on principle. Public opinion in Austria, the Netherlands and some other countries has become more hostile.</p>\n<p>Three things have made matters worse for Turkey’s EU aspirations. The first is Cyprus, which joined the EU along with the east Europeans in May 2004. As a prelude, the then UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, tried one last time to reach a deal on unifying the divided island. But although the Turkish-Cypriots overwhelmingly said yes to the deal in a referendum, the Greek-Cypriots even more overwhelmingly said no. As a consequence the (Greek-Cypriot) republic joined the EU as the legitimate government with the <em>acquis communautaire</em> of EU legislation, suspended for the (Turkish-Cypriot) north. Cyprus is now the biggest single obstacle to Turkey’s EU hopes.</p>\n<p>The second problem has been domestic political upheaval as the secular establishment and military top brass have battled against the AK government. A series of coup threats, conspiracies and constitutional court cases have created the impression of a country in political turmoil, helping to stoke European opposition to Turkish membership. </p>\n<p>Third was the economic crisis that began in 2008 and hit Europe especially hard in 2009. Recession and rising unemployment have put paid to most thoughts of further EU enlargement. As it is, the deteriorating economy, the recent troubles of the euro zone and a backlash against immigration from the east have all lent force to widespread complaints that the central and eastern European countries were let into the EU too early.</p>\n<p><a name=\"chapters_of_accidents\"></a><br><strong>Chapters of accidents</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Turkey’s membership negotiations have all but ground to a halt. Of the 35 “chapters” into which the talks are divided, as many as 18 are blocked by the EU as a whole, by Cyprus or by France. They include areas where Turkey might be expected to have a lot to offer, such as external relations and energy. Only one chapter, on science, has been closed. So far this year just one new chapter, on food-safety standards, has been opened. Next year it may prove impossible to open any at all.</p>\n\n<p>Not surprisingly, the Turks are getting fed up. According to the Pew Global Attitudes Survey, back in 2005 some 68% of Turks favoured joining the EU, with 27% against. Now the numbers are 54% in favour and 40% against. Eurobarometer polls show similar results. In September a German Marshall Fund survey found that, whereas in 2004 some 73% of Turks thought joining the EU would be a good thing, in 2010 only 38% did (see chart 4). </p>\n<p>Both Egemen Bagis, the Turks’ chief European negotiator, and Stefan Fule, the enlargement commissioner in Brussels, gamely insist that the talks are proceeding normally. Mr Bagis trots out two lines that have become familiar to observers. The first is that “the process is more important than the end-result.” The AK government says it is making reforms for their own sake, not just to satisfy Brussels. </p>\n<p>That is sensible. Most things a country has to do to qualify to open membership talks and then to join are desirable in themselves (it would be a sad comment on the EU if they were not). When the new members from central and eastern Europe joined, the biggest reforms were those introduced before accession. Afterwards the EU loses much of its leverage.</p>\n<p>Yet even if the journey is the most important thing, it is harder to persuade the Turks to undertake it if they believe they will never reach their destination. Why should businessmen welcome the opening up of Turkey’s public-procurement market to more competition from European companies, for example, if they are not sure that they will one day be rewarded with membership? </p>\n<p>Mr Bagis’s second line is that “every day that passes Europe needs Turkey more and Turkey needs Europe less.” In the same vein, Mr Davutoglu likes to argue that his visionary foreign policy is making Turkey ever more valuable to the EU. Once again, there is something in this. A rapidly growing Turkey that acquires greater economic, military and diplomatic clout ought to be a bigger prize for the Europeans to catch. But the argument can still be taken too far, in two respects. </p>\n<p>The first is that, despite the rhetoric, joining the EU does not really involve any negotiation at all. An applicant country is simply required to adopt and implement all 160,000-odd pages of the European <em>acquis</em>. To assert that the EU needs Turkey more than the other way round sets the wrong tone, making it sound as though the supplicant is Brussels, not Ankara.</p>\n<p>Second, an enterprising foreign policy of the sort that Mr Davutoglu is pursuing can jar with the EU’s own policy. This is not just a matter of saying no to sanctions against Iran or uttering tirades against Israel. The Turkish goal of visa-free access for almost all its neighbours could easily contradict the EU’s own plans for tighter border controls. No wonder some in Berlin, Paris and even Brussels maintain that Turkey is too wilful and unreliable ever to sit comfortably inside the EU.</p>\n<p>Can anything be done to get Turkey’s EU aspirations back on track? No country has ever begun entry negotiations without eventually being offered full membership, but plenty have encountered big problems on the way. Britain’s application was twice vetoed by France’s Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s. Spain took nine years to get in. Norway was twice offered membership, only for voters to turn it down in referendums. </p>\n<p>The best way to promote Turkey’s membership now would be to resolve the Cyprus problem, but the prospects of that look shaky (see <a href=\"/node/17276362\">article</a>). It is also possible that, after the Turkish election next June, a new constitution and a renewed enthusiasm for reform may inject fresh life into the negotiations. The rising possibility that Mr Sarkozy will lose the presidential election in France in 2012 is also a good omen for Turkey. </p>\n<p>But it may not be enough just to sit and wait. Hence another idea, suggested by Heather Grabbe of the Open Society Institute in Brussels, among others: to incorporate Turkey into the EU’s foreign and security policy now, without waiting for it to become a full member. This would make the country more familiar with the give-and-take of finding a common position and bolster the EU’s security. Turkey has a presence in places like Iran and Syria where the EU’s influence is weak. Mr Davutoglu might be reluctant to trammel his dream of an independent foreign policy. But the Turks might accept a strategic dialogue so long as it supplemented rather than supplanted its membership talks.</p>\n<p>Another idea, promoted by Cengiz Aktar, a seasoned Turkish foreign-policy commentator, is to set a target date by which the negotiations should be wrapped up and membership achieved. He has suggested 2023, the centenary year of the founding of Ataturk’s republic. It is sufficiently far off to be tolerable to opponents of early Turkish accession, but close enough to encourage doubters within Turkey. Yet setting a date would make a difference only if people really believed in it, and the precedents are not encouraging. The EU guaranteed entry in 2007 on a fixed timetable to Bulgaria and Romania. Both countries joined before they were really ready, and the results have been messy.</p>\n<p>Other suggestions include agreeing now that Turkey will never enjoy free movement of labour in the EU, to reassure European workers fearful of hordes of Turks stealing their jobs; or limiting Turkey’s voting weight in the EU’s institutions to stop it becoming the most powerful single country. But all of these would look like a form of second-class membership, which would be hard for the Turks to accept. In the end there may be no alternative to plodding on with the membership negotiations and just hoping for a change in the climate on both sides. Nobody has any reason to stop the talks now. </p>\n<p>Yet this poses problems of its own. One is how to keep the negotiators on both sides busy. When they run out of chapters to open and discuss, what will they do? And even if something can be found to occupy them, there is a second and bigger problem: how to sustain the Turks’ interest in joining. Much will depend on what happens next in Turkish politics, now at an unusually critical moment. </p>","rubric":"Will Turkey ever join the EU?","id":"17276372"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"Immovable object","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>CYPRUS bedevils Turkey’s hopes of joining the European Union. The problem dates almost as far back as the leasing of the island to Britain after the 1878 Congress of Berlin. In 1960 Cyprus won its independence and became a federal state that, in theory, respected the rights of both Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots (respectively 80% and 20% of Cyprus’s 1m-odd people). But as early as 1964 the Turkish-Cypriots were driven into enclaves by the majority Greek-Cypriots.</p>\n<p>In July 1974 a coup against the Greek-Cypriot leader, Archbishop Makarios, brought in a regime set on <em>enosis</em>, or union with Greece. Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in the same month. After a brief campaign the Turks captured over a third of the island, driving out or killing the Greek-Cypriots. A ceasefire line turned into a UN-patrolled green line. Nicosia is Europe’s last divided capital.</p>\n<p>There have since been six rounds of UN-sponsored talks on unifying the island. Until 2003 they foundered on the opposition of the obdurate Turkish-Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, who openly preferred the idea of an independent north and in 1983 proclaimed the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus, which was recognised only by Turkey. The most serious effort at a settlement came in 2003-04. Partly because the obstacle to unity had always been Mr Denktash, but mainly because Greece threatened to block EU enlargement to eastern Europe, the EU decided in 2000 that it would admit Cyprus as a member even if the island remained divided. With Mr Denktash sidelined and a new government in Ankara, the time seemed ripe for a new effort by the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan. </p>\n      \n  <p>But the effort was doomed by the unconditional promise to the Greek-Cypriots of EU membership. When the Annan plan for unification was set out in early 2004, that promise allowed the Greek-Cypriot leader, Tassos Papadopoulos, to urge voters to reject it. In April 2004 some 65% of Turkish-Cypriots, lobbied from Ankara, voted in favour, but 76% of Greek-Cypriots said no. A week later Cyprus joined the EU, with the <em>acquis communautaire</em> suspended in the north.</p>\n<p>When Turkey opened its membership talks with the EU in 2005, Cyprus promptly became a big issue. As members, both Greece and Cyprus have a veto. Also, Turkey’s customs union with the EU was due to be extended to all new EU members, including Cyprus. But the Turks have refused to allow Cypriot vessels access to their ports and airports because the Greek-Cypriots are blocking an EU promise, made after the referendums in 2004, to allow direct trade with the north.</p>\n<p>In 2008 Mr Papadopoulos was ousted by a more moderate president, Demetris Christofias. By chance Mr Christofias was an old trade-union comrade of the Turkish-Cypriot leader, Mehmet Ali Talat. Their friendship encouraged another round of talks. But Turkish-Cypriot voters failed to re-elect Mr Talat in April 2010. Instead they chose Dervish Eroglu, an opponent of the Annan plan for unification who barely knows Mr Christofias.</p>\n<p>The settlement talks might yet get a push from the European Parliament, which hopes to revive a regulation that would allow direct trade with the north. Under the Lisbon treaty, this can be adopted by majorities that circumvent a Cypriot veto. Yet it has only a small chance of passing. The odds on a settlement seem equally slim, even though Mr Eroglu and Mr Christofias are still meeting. There is now talk of permanent partition. But if the Cyprus problem remains unsolved Turkey has little hope of joining the EU. </p>","rubric":"Cyprus remains a stumbling-block","id":"17276362"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"Balance of power","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>TURKEY’S politics used to be as quirky and colourful as the country itself. Parties would be formed and as quickly disappear, politicians would suddenly be banned, coalitions of all shapes and sizes would be tried—and every so often the army would kick out an errant government. But all this changed after Turkey’s economic crisis of 2001.</p>\n<p>In the election of November 2002 just two parties were returned to Turkey’s grand assembly, or parliament; all others failed to reach the 10% threshold below which they win no seats. Mr Erdogan’s mildly Islamist Justice and Development (AK) party got 34% of the vote and Ataturk’s old Republican People’s Party (CHP), led by Deniz Baykal, took 19%. It was enough for AK to form a single-party government that has been in power ever since.</p>\n<p>Mr Erdogan has been the dominant actor on the Turkish political stage for almost a decade. Once an aspiring professional footballer, he became a highly successful mayor of Istanbul in 1994. He was then a member of Necmettin Erbakan’s Welfare Party, an avowedly Islamist outfit. Mr Erbakan’s government was pushed out by the army after the so-called “soft coup” of 1997. Mr Erdogan himself was briefly jailed in 1999 for the offence of reading an Islamist part of a poem in public. This conviction at first stopped him taking up his parliamentary seat in 2002, so Abdullah Gul served as prime minister until March 2003. </p>\n      \n  <p>There is thus little doubt about Mr Erdogan’s Islamist credentials. His democratic ones are less clear. He once called democracy a train from which to disembark on reaching one’s destination. In office as prime minister he has displayed an authoritarian streak. He dislikes opposition and is intolerant of criticism. He has a reputation for keeping lists and remembering the names of his enemies, especially in the media—and of harassing them. </p>\n<p>Yet he and his colleagues learnt from their experience with Mr Erbakan and the army in the 1990s. They broke with Welfare and set up the AK party in 2001, in many ways more of a moderate conservative party than a religious one. True, it has roots in earlier Islamist parties and also links with the powerful Fethullah Gulen movement, led by a Muslim cleric now based in America. But AK still came to power on a moderate platform, promising to press for EU accession and to push through liberalising constitutional and economic reforms. </p>\n<p>This was not enough to reconcile the secularist opposition or the army to Mr Erdogan’s government. Both have treated AK with deep suspicion from the outset. They were not impressed when the government completed the economic turnaround begun by its predecessor. Nor did they soften when it enacted enough reforms to win the much-coveted opening of EU membership talks in October 2005. Nor yet were they interested in the first serious effort by any government to talk to the Kurds. To the AK’s opponents, what really mattered was to safeguard the secularist tradition of Ataturk from Islamic fundamentalism.</p>\n<p>One early flashpoint was the treatment of graduates of <em>imam hatip</em> religious schools. Another was a proposal by the government to make adultery a crime, which was dropped soon after being put forward in order to appease the EU. But the most explosive—and symbolic—issue of all has been the Muslim veil or headscarf, worn by the wives of both Mr Erdogan and Mr Gul, who became foreign minister in March 2003. The row over the veil came to a head, as it were, in 2007.</p>\n<p><a name=\"veils_of_ignorance\"></a><br><strong>Veils of ignorance</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As in fiercely secular France, the headscarf is banned in state institutions, which in Turkey’s case may include universities. The AK party’s supporters were (and remain) keen to lift this ban as the numbers of women sporting the veil in public goes up (although there is some evidence that the total number wearing it is declining). Yet the government has been hesitant, mindful of opposition from both the army and the constitutional court.</p>\n<p>What brought the issue to a crunch was the end of the term of office of the Turkish president, Ahmet Sezer, who was a strongly secular former judge. In the spring of 2007 Mr Erdogan announced that his candidate to succeed Mr Sezer was none other than Mr Gul. The army, under a newish chief of staff, reacted forcefully. In April 2007, in what became known as the e-coup, it posted a message on its website threatening to step in to prevent the appointment of a president whose wife wore the headscarf. Soon afterwards, at the urging of Mr Baykal’s CHP, the constitutional court issued a thoroughly dubious ruling invalidating a parliamentary vote in favour of Mr Gul’s candidacy.</p>\n<p>Mr Erdogan responded by calling an early election in July 2007. AK won a convincing victory, with almost 47% of the vote against the CHP’s 21% (although its parliamentary majority shrank because Devlet Bahceli’s far-right Nationalist Action Party, or MHP, also jumped the 10% hurdle). Armed with his new majority, Mr Erdogan got his way. Mr Gul became president in late August. The government also promised to change the rules so that in future the president would be elected by the voters, not by parliament. That has led many to predict that Mr Erdogan himself might run for the job in 2012.</p>\n<p>But though the army was chastened, the government’s troubles were not over once Mr Gul was installed in the Cankaya palace. An act to permit the headscarf in universities was overturned by the constitutional court. Next, prosecutors called on the same court to ban the AK party and several named political leaders, including Mr Erdogan and Mr Gul, for pursuing overtly “anti-secular activities”. In late July 2008 the court ruled against a ban, but by only a single vote. (In December 2009 it banned the main Kurdish political party.)</p>\n<p>And still the argument went on. Earlier this year the AK government drew up more constitutional reforms, including provisions to subject the army to greater civilian control and give parliament more say in judicial appointments. After failing to win enough support in parliament, the government dropped some plans, notably those to make it harder to ban political parties. But it put those curbing the army, including provisions allowing leaders of military coups to be put on trial and allowing the government to appoint constitutional court judges, to a referendum on September 12th this year, which it won by a majority of 58% to 42%. </p>\n<p>The AK government has thus won most of its battles with the secularist establishment and the army. But its long-drawn-out war has still had two highly damaging consequences. One was to distract the government. The pace of reform was much quicker between 2002 and 2005, when Turkey’s EU membership negotiations began, than since, which is one reason why the talks have dragged. Worse, the lack of progress in the talks has led many Turks to give up on the EU dream altogether.</p>\n<p>The second effect was to increase Mr Erdogan’s autocratic instincts. One might have hoped he would soften after almost a decade in office, but he has not. Many journalists complain that the political atmosphere makes it unwise to criticise the AK party in general and Mr Erdogan in particular. Some practise self-censorship. Before the September referendum Mr Erdogan threatened to destroy TUSIAD, the employers’ federation, for not advocating a yes vote. It has become especially hard to try to expose or even discuss the corruption to be found within the AK party.</p>\n<p>A prime example concerns the country’s biggest media conglomerate, the Dogan group. Until 2006 Dogan, which controls two big newspapers, <em>Milliyet</em> and <em>Hurriyet</em>, as well as several television stations, had few difficulties with the AK government. But in 2007 it fell out with Mr Erdogan over stories linking party bigwigs to the diversion of money from a German-based charity. After more unfavourable articles appeared, the group suddenly found itself the object of an unusually vigorous tax inspection, involving as many as 16-18 tax audits in one year, says an insider.</p>\n<p>The Dogan affair is too complex for outsiders to grasp in detail. Tax demands have been made and negotiated down, but the amounts have risen. At one point in 2009 the group faced a bill as big as $4 billion, reminiscent of Russia’s treatment of the Yukos oil company. Dogan has since mended some fences with the government, shut down a TV programme and sacked a few columnists, so a truce may prevail. The finance minister, Mehmet Simsek, insists that the tax authorities have acted independently. Aydin Dogan, the main owner, notes that his media interests, a small part of the group, have proved the most troublesome. In its 2009 progress report, the European Commission heavily criticised the government over Dogan.</p>\n<p>Turkey’s second big political-conspiracy theory is juicier still. It comes under the label Ergenekon, the name for a series of charges levelled by prosecutors against various generals and other high-ranking officers. These brass hats are alleged to have plotted several coups, including one codenamed “Sledgehammer”, complete with detailed plans for the deployment of jet fighters and tanks. Many alleged leaders languish in prison awaiting trial. </p>\n<p>Nobody familiar with Turkey’s post-war history would lightly dismiss allegations that a coup was in the making. In 1960 the army overthrew the government of Adnan Menderes, whom the generals proceeded to hang. There was another coup in 1971, and yet another in 1980. After that the army rewrote the constitution, which with a few amendments remains in force. The most recent “soft coup” was in 1997.</p>\n<p>There is some evidence of a conspiracy in the Ergenekon case. Yet there is also reason to believe that over-zealous prosecutors have pushed things too far. Some of the charges have been dropped and some suspects released. Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist whose father-in-law is one of the generals involved, is not alone in believing that many of the charges are fabricated and that the Gulenists and the AK party have exploited the case to settle old scores. The truth about Ergenekon may (or may not) emerge in court but it leaves a bad smell all round.</p>\n<p><a name=\"enter_gandhi\"></a><br><strong>Enter Gandhi</strong>\n</p>\n<p> What of the opposition? The news is mixed. In May the charismatic but ineffectual Mr Baykal was dumped as the CHP leader after a sex scandal, to be replaced by Kemal Kilicdaroglu, known as Gandhi for his ascetic lifestyle. Mr Kilicdaroglu has promised to revitalise Ataturk’s party. Several defectors from the CHP who were fed up with Mr Baykal and in some cases had even started new parties have since returned to the fold. But the new leader still needs more political experience, and because he fought hard for a no vote in the referendum he has lost some face.</p>\n\n<p>It is a plus that Mr Kilicdaroglu is an Alevi, a member of a liberal Shia Muslim sect. He also has both Kurdish and Armenian forebears. Much to his credit, and unlike rather too many AK members, he stands above the usual corruption of Turkish politics. His political instincts seem sound. He is strongly pro-EU, calling it a “civilisational project”. He also insists that “we are completely opposed to military intervention in politics: the soldiers should remain in their barracks.”</p>\n<p>Mr Kilicdaroglu expresses proper concerns about the autocratic rule of Mr Erdogan’s AK party. He accuses the government of “limiting freedom” and criticises the treatment of Dogan and the Ergenekon case. He claims that the AK party disguises its religious agenda by switching the focus to secularism as a problem in itself. In foreign policy he frets about the risk of Turkey moving away from the West.</p>\n<p>The trouble is that his party (over which he may not have total control) remains too hostile to reform. Its decision to fight for a no vote in September’s referendum proved to be a mistake, not so much because the proposals being put to the vote have increased democratic control over the army and the higher judiciary but more because the AK won by such a convincing margin. The CHP fiercely resists political concessions to the Kurds. Mr Kilicdaroglu insists, not entirely persuasively, that the roots of the Kurdish problem are economic, not cultural or political (though he is open to the idea of negotiations with the PKK). His party’s vote is very low in the south-east.</p>\n<p><a name=\"next_year%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%99s_permutations\"></a><br><strong>Next year’s permutations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>What will next summer’s election bring? The polls suggest that AK will once again be the biggest party, with at least 38-40%. But that is down from 2007, and despite the referendum debacle the CHP could go up to 30%. The main Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) seems certain to win seats. Much will then depend on whether the nationalist MHP can again get above the 10% threshold (which Mr Kilicdaroglu, among others, would like to see lowered). After the referendum, when many of its supporters backed the AK, this looked less likely. But it could still happen, especially if PKK violence is resumed—and that might deny the AK a majority.</p>\n<p>That would make the task of amending the 1982 constitution trickier, although it might at least force the AK party to do it on a bipartisan basis. Mr Kilicdaroglu insists that he would never go into coalition with AK. It would be hard, though perhaps not impossible, for any party to work with the MHP, which espouses disturbingly nationalist views. A more intriguing possibility is a pact between AK and the BDP, which has taken over from its banned predecessor and which successfully led a campaign in the south-east to boycott the September referendum. Whether such a link could ever work depends mainly on how much progress can be made towards solving the Kurdish problem. Sadly at the moment there is not enough. </p>","rubric":"A mildly Islamist government fights it out with the generals","id":"17276408"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"All Turks together?","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>MOST Turkish schoolchildren take part in a weekly flag ceremony during which they recite a patriotic chant ending, “Happy is he who calls himself a Turk.” The old Ottoman empire was a patchwork quilt of different nationalities and religions, but Ataturk’s Turkey was intolerant of non-Turks, even though the Lausanne treaty of 1923 recognised the existence of Armenians, Greeks and Jews. In his book on eastern Turkey, “Rebel Land”, Christopher de Bellaigue recalls going with a Kurdish friend to meet a local governor. When he tentatively tries to ask about the treatment of minorities, the governor brusquely interrupts to say that “we have no minorities in Turkey.”</p>\n<p>In reality Turkey today is a multi-ethnic, multifaith society. Some 99% of the population are Muslim, most of them Sunni. But a minority, perhaps 10-15%, are Alevi, a humanist branch of Shia Islam. Turkey also has deep regional divides and exceptional inequality among regions (income per head around Istanbul is almost ten times as high as in the poorest eastern provinces). It also has some 14m Kurds, who are Sunni Muslims but ethnically and linguistically distinct from Turks. Perhaps 3m of them live in Istanbul, which in that sense is the world’s biggest Kurdish city. But most are in the poor south-east, where they make up 85-90% of the population.</p>\n<p><a name=\"i_see_no_kurds\"></a><br><strong>I see no Kurds</strong>\n</p>      \n  <p>The Kurdish question is a festering sore in Turkey. That is in part because successive Turkish governments, egged on by the army, have refused to recognise the Kurds’ existence. Article 166 of the constitution, which remains in force, declares baldly that the inhabitants of Turkey are Turks. For many years Kurds went under the derogatory label “mountain Turks”. Not only was Kurdish culture suppressed, but so was the language. It was banned in education, in broadcasting and even in parliament. In the 1990s, Leyla Zana, a newly elected Kurdish member, was tried and jailed after uttering a few words of Kurdish in parliament.</p>\n<p>As in so many countries that have suppressed their minorities, a backlash was inevitable. It came in the form of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), founded by the charismatic Abdullah Ocalan in 1978. Helped for many years by Syria, the PKK has since 1984 waged a long and violent campaign against the Turkish army and state. It has also committed terrorist atrocities, especially but not only in the south-east. The PKK is classified as a terrorist organisation in both Europe and America.</p>\n<p>The army’s crackdown in response has been even more violent. Troops and tanks have spread out across the region. Fighter aircraft have bombed suspected guerrilla bases, including some in northern Iraq and Syria. Thousands of suspects have been killed or jailed. A system of village guards was set up, supposedly to fight the PKK but as often to intimidate the locals. At the height of the campaign entire villages were depopulated and 1m people herded into cities.</p>\n<p> The grisly details of human-rights abuses, torture and extra-judicial killings in Diyarbakir, Batman, Van and elsewhere have been extensively documented by brave human-rights lawyers and campaigners. The death toll over the PKK’s 26-year-old insurgency has reached 40,000, most of them Kurds. That is more than ten times the number killed during the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland.</p>\n<p>Even government officials concede that the Kurdish problem cannot be solved by force alone. The PKK was weakened by the capture and imprisonment of Mr Ocalan in 1999 (he is now held on an island near Istanbul). The level of violence has declined somewhat, and the PKK has periodically declared ceasefires (one is in force now). Yet the organisation is not defeated, and the autonomy won by the Kurdish region of northern Iraq will inevitably give it sustenance. The Kurds’ grievances which the PKK has exploited remain unsettled. </p>\n<p>That is not entirely for want of trying. Successive governments have poured resources into the region, believing that the problem is caused partly by the south-east’s backwardness and poverty. The south-eastern Anatolia project (GAP) is the most ambitious and expensive infrastructure project Turkey has ever undertaken; in the 1990s it represented some 5-8% of all investment in the country. It aimed to improve agriculture and provide water and electricity to poor south-eastern villages around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Its network of dams has boosted farm productivity and raised living standards across the region.</p>\n<p>Some parts of the east and south-east have also joined in the wider Anatolian economic boom of the past two decades. The city of Gaziantep, in particular, has followed the better-known example of Kayseri into manufacturing. In recent years Gaziantep and much of the surrounding region have also benefited greatly from growing trade with Syria and Iraq (see <a href=\"/node/17276352\">article</a>). Yet poor education and infrastructure, a deeply conservative Muslim culture and the violence of the PKK continue to discourage investment.</p>\n<p>The AK government has tried harder than any predecessor to make amends. Soon after it came to power, it allowed the first ever Kurdish-language television broadcasts. Mr Erdogan has paid several visits to Diyarbakir, the Kurds’ unofficial capital. In 2005 he went so far as to admit to past mistakes, apologise for Turkey’s mistreatment of the Kurds and recognise their legitimate aspirations. He was rewarded with a strong showing for the AK party in the 2007 election, when it won more votes in the region than the main Kurdish party. More recently the government has worked hard to reach an accommodation with the Kurds of northern Iraq.</p>\n<p>Yet any Turkish government, no matter how strong, is constrained by two powerful forces: the army and the nationalists. The army resists concessions to the Kurds because it does not want to seem soft on terrorism. Conspiracy theorists also point to evidence of a “deep state” that prolongs the fight against the PKK by staging terrorist acts itself. Nationalists, meanwhile, fret that gestures to meet demands for greater autonomy will inevitably lead to the break-up of Turkey. Both opposition parties, especially the far-right MHP, have fiercely resisted openings towards the Kurds, which is one reason why they win so few votes in the south-east.</p>\n<p>Yet in fits and starts, and under pressure from the EU, Mr Erdogan has persisted with his overtures. In mid-2009 his government launched an initiative it called the Kurdish opening, later renamed the democratic opening (and labelled by a local AK official as the “national unity and brotherhood project”). The same year saw the start of the first state-owned 24-hour Kurdish-language TV station. And in a blaze of publicity, the government gave an amnesty to a clutch of disarmed PKK fighters based in northern Iraq, allowing them to return home unmolested.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this particular move backfired. Instead of returning quietly home, the PKK men triumphantly paraded in uniform through the streets of Diyarbakir. Turkish nationalists and the army were indignant. The government withdrew a promise to let more fighters return—and the PKK resumed battle. It was widely noted that, on the same day that the nine Turkish civilians killed aboard the <em>Mavi Marmara</em> were given huge media coverage, six soldiers lost their lives to the PKK in the south. </p>\n<p><a name=\"devolution,_devolution\"></a><br><strong>Devolution, devolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hard as it may be, more will have to be done to assuage Kurdish feelings. Turkey needs to stop the common practice in the south-east of arresting and jailing elected mayors for allegedly expressing PKK sympathies. As part of a new constitution promised by Mr Erdogan after the next election, article 166 about the inhabitants of Turkey being Turks could be dropped. Allowing Kurdish-language teaching in schools would also be a good idea, but it is controversial. The governor of Batman, for example, expresses cautious support for it, but the governor of Diyarbakir is against. Yet steps like these will be needed if Turkey is ever to get into the EU. And the 1923 Lausanne treaty states clearly that “no restrictions shall be imposed on the free use…of any language.”</p>\n<p>Turkey’s regional problems go beyond the Kurdish question. Thanks to Ataturk, the country is excessively centralised. The governors of all 81 Turkish provinces are appointed by the government in Ankara. Over time most have become AK men. Education is still largely run from the centre, on the traditional French model. Given the country’s size and diversity, that may not be the most sensible approach. Turkey now badly needs a debate on more devolution of power to democratically elected local bodies.</p>\n<p> What about the army and the nationalists? Mr Erdogan and the AK may now be well placed to call their bluff. By winning the referendum on constitutional changes in mid-September by such a wide margin, the AK government has shown the weakness of the nationalist opposition, especially the MHP. This, and the promise of a new constitution next year, may create an opportunity for imaginative gestures. That the main Kurdish party, the BDP, persuaded so many Kurds to boycott the referendum serves to show again that neither it, nor the PKK, can be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>BDP officials in Diyarbakir dismiss the so-called Kurdish opening as rubbish. The party is wary in part because its predecessor, the DTP, was banned by the constitutional court in 2009. But its success over the referendum boycott reflects its continuing appeal to Kurdish voters. It will win its usual clutch of seats in next year’s election. If AK fails to get a majority, it could do worse than seek a deal (if not a formal coalition) in exchange for BDP support.</p>\n<p>That would, however, require concessions such as Kurdish-language education, more power for local mayors and reining in the army. British experience in Northern Ireland also suggests that the AK government may yet have to talk to Mr Ocalan direct. Sezgin Tanrikulu, a lawyer with the Human Rights Foundation in Diyarbakir, declares portentously that Turkey is near the “last exit” with the Kurds. But if Mr Erdogan is bold enough to seize the moment, he could yet crown his premiership with a peace settlement in the south-east. </p>","rubric":"Turkey is overcentralised and treats minorities badly","id":"17276398"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"Silk road to riches","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>ANATOLIA’S success stories are usually about such places as Kayseri and Konya. Ankara too has mushroomed out of nothing, to a point where its population is bigger than that of any other European capital except London, Moscow and Paris. But there are also unsung heroes in the south and east. One such is Gaziantep, which with a population of some 1.35m is the country’s sixth-largest city. Its proud (AK) mayor, Asim Guzelbey, likes to call it “the rising star of Turkey”.</p>\n<p>Until recently, Gaziantep (Antep for short) was a sleepy, poor provincial town. A smattering of tourists were drawn by its fortress, its ancient history, the Roman mosaics of Zeugma, the Euphrates river, a few old Armenian churches and houses—and its traditional produce of pistachios, hazelnuts and what it claims to be the world’s best baklava (a sticky pastry). Appropriately enough, Antep was the home town one of Turkey’s earliest tourism ministers, the CHP’s Ali Ilsan Gogus, who began the development of Turkey’s Mediterranean coastline in the 1960s.</p>\n\n<p>But in the past few years Antep has blossomed. Dotted around the city are factories making carpets, shoes, plastic packaging, white goods and much else. Mr Guzelbey says the region now produces $4 billion-worth of annual exports which he claims support 100,000 new jobs in four big industrial estates. Unemployment is down to 9-10%, less than the national average and far below the level in the more predominantly Kurdish south-eastern region of Turkey.</p>\n      \n  <p>Mr Guzelbey naturally attributes much of Antep’s success to his own party’s efforts. When he took office in 2004 the city was heavily indebted, transport links were poor and there was almost no foreign investment. All that has changed. The airport is heaving with visitors from abroad and the roads are vastly improved. Managers at Royal Carpets, a big local producer, concede that the AK government has been helpful, offering tax cuts, trade promotion—and, perhaps most importantly, visa liberalisation.</p>\n<p>The secret of the region’s new strength lies in its ancient links with Syria and Iraq. Antep is on the old silk road that leads to Aleppo. Partly thanks to the abolition of visa requirements for Syrians, cross-border trade is booming. According to Mr Guzelbey, over half the region’s exports now go to Iraq, Syria or elsewhere in the Middle East and only a quarter to Europe. That helped exports from Antep rise by 6% in value in 2009, whereas those from Turkey as a whole fell by 20%.</p>\n<p>Antep’s new links with the Arab world recall its own history. Besides being on the silk road, it is famous mainly for its heroic ten-month resistance against a siege by French forces in 1921. Although the city eventually capitulated, the nascent Turkish parliament awarded it the honorific prefix Gazi, “warrior of the faith”. In its mix of Muslim piety and hard-headed business nous, Gaziantep speaks volumes about modern Anatolia—and Turkey. </p>","rubric":"Gaziantep’s rise and rise","id":"17276352"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"In it for the long haul","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>IT HAS become a joke for <em>The Economist</em> to say that a country is at a crossroads, yet for Turkey it happens to be spot on. The next year or two will be critical to where the country is going.</p>\n<p>The economy is in better shape than at any time since the second world war. At its current breathtaking growth rate Turkey is catching up fast with the poorer countries of continental Europe. The political judgment is less straightforward. The AK government under Mr Erdogan has done more than any since Ataturk to reform Turkey. It has pushed through many political and legal reforms. It has taken big steps towards resolving the Kurdish question. If it is re-elected next year, AK will make an overdue start on rewriting the constitution drawn up after the 1980 military coup.</p>\n\n<p>Yet this is also where the doubts start to creep in. The secular establishment’s concern about Mr Erdogan and the AK party has always been that behind the reassuring “mildly Islamist” label lie deeper fundamentalist ambitions. People in the cafés of Istanbul fret that, if the veil were allowed in state institutions, the next stop would be Iran. Yet although many in AK, including Mr Erdogan, are doubtless pious, Turkey is surely too democratic, pluralist and, well, modern for this to be a serious danger. The lesson of the past decade is that the secularists have cried wolf too often—and as a result have lost most of their battles with AK.</p>\n      \n  <p>It is the condition of Turkey’s democracy that is more worrying. The AK leadership, especially Mr Erdogan, has proved highly partisan and intolerant of criticism. That has turned Turkey into a deeply divided country. The results of the September referendum were revealing: a big yes in most of Anatolia (save in the Kurdish region) but a firm no in large parts of Istanbul, Izmir and the west. To overcome such divisions when it comes to drawing up a new constitution, Mr Erdogan needs to find a way of working with the opposition, but he shows no signs of doing this. Turkey has long lacked a credible opposition, but the new CHP leader, Mr Kilicdaroglu, could yet come to fill that gap. </p>\n<p>A longish period of one-party rule has also fostered a culture that tolerates corruption at the heart of the government. The party’s leaders may be clean, but many of those around them are not. Another problem is Mr Erdogan’s autocratic manner, which risks trammelling free debate in the media. Critics who sometimes liken him to Russia’s Vladimir Putin have got it wrong, but many journalists in Istanbul and Ankara now feel that they cannot say or write what they think.</p>\n<p>Turkey is not the only European country to suffer from corruption, autocratic leadership or fears about a free press. But because there are already so many vocal opponents of its aspirations to join the EU, its membership hopes are damaged every time that there is a fresh outburst of criticism from Brussels of another bout of political turmoil at home.</p>\n<p><a name=\"keep_persevering\"></a><br><strong>Keep persevering</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Plenty of Turks, including some in AK, are starting to say that it does not matter. The EU is not going to admit Turkey anyway, they argue, so why should they care what the Europeans think? Yet in truth, although Turkey has developed new relationships in the Middle East and even with Russia, as a liberal market democracy it has no real alternative to Europe. Its hopes of joining the EU may not be realised for many years, but Turkey will not be the first country that has had trouble getting in: Britain took 12 years and Spain nine. </p>\n<p>Besides, Turkey needs to keep on modernising for its own sake, not just to please the Brussels bureaucracy. So long as it keeps on track, it will continue both to thrive and to matter—and an EU that wants to remain relevant will find it increasingly hard to keep Turkey out. </p>","rubric":"But a liberal democracy ready to join the EU is still the best bet","id":"17276430"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Special reports","headline":"Sources and acknowledgments","title":"A special report on Turkey","content":"<p>This special report draws on the insights and opinions of people more knowledgeable than its author, many of whom are not quoted by name in the text.

The current smart-phone patent war does not quite have the same romance, but it could be as important. </p>\n<p>Hardly a week passes without a new case. Motorola sued Apple this month, having itself been sued by Microsoft a few days earlier. Since 2006 the number of mobile-phone-related patent complaints has increased by 20% annually, according to Lex Machina, a firm that keeps a database of intellectual-property spats in America. </p>\n  <p>Most suits were filed by patent owners who hail from another industry, such as Kodak (a firm from a bygone era that now makes printers), or by patent trolls (firms that buy patents not in order to make products, but to sue others for allegedly infringing them). But in recent months the makers of handsets and related software themselves have become much more litigious, reports Joshua Walker, the boss of Lex Machina.</p>\n<p>This orgy for lawyers is partly a result of the explosion of the market for smart-phones. IDC, a market-research firm, expects that 270m smart-phones will be sold this year: 55% more than in 2009. “It has become worthwhile to defend one’s intellectual property,” says Richard Windsor of Nomura, an investment bank.</p>\n<p>Yet there is more than this going on. Smart-phones are not just another type of handset, but fully-fledged computers, which come loaded with software and double as digital cameras and portable entertainment centres. They combine technologies from different industries, most of them patented. Given such complexity, sorting out who owns what requires time and a phalanx of lawyers. </p>\n<p>The convergence of different industries has also led to a culture clash. When it comes to intellectual property, mobile-phone firms have mostly operated like a club. They jointly develop new technical standards: for example, for a new generation of wireless networks. They then license or swap the patents “essential” to this standard under “fair and reasonable” conditions.</p>\n<p><a name=\"of_apps_and_scraps\"></a><br><strong>Of apps and scraps</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Not being used to such a collectivist set-up, Apple refused to pay up, which triggered the first big legal skirmish over smart-phones. A year ago Nokia lobbed a lawsuit at Apple, alleging that its American rival’s iPhone infringes on a number of its “essential patents”. A couple of months later, Apple returned the favour, alleging that Nokia had copied some iPhone features. Since then both sides have upped the ante by filing additional complaints.</p>\n\n<p>Lending ferocity to this legal firefight is the fact that competition in the smart-phone market is not merely about individual products, but entire platforms and operating systems (see chart). These are the infrastructures that allow other firms to develop applications, or “apps”, for these devices. Should any one firm gain an important lead, it might dominate the industry for decades—just as Microsoft has dominated the market for personal-computer (PC) software.</p>\n<p>Yet there is a difference between the smart-phone war and the earlier one over PCs. There is a new type of player: firms with open-source platforms. Google, for instance, which makes its money from advertisements, does not charge for Android (its operating system for smart-phones) and lets others modify the software. This makes life hard for vendors of proprietary platforms, such as Apple and Microsoft.</p>\n<p>This explains another set of closely watched lawsuits. In March Apple sued HTC, a Taiwanese maker of smart-phones, which responded in kind a couple of months later. Earlier this month it was Microsoft’s turn to file a lawsuit against Motorola, which is likely to retaliate soon. And Oracle, a maker of business software, has sued Google directly, albeit over a different issue, concerning how Android uses Java, a programming language.</p>\n<p>Some expect Apple and Microsoft to sue Google. Yet this is unlikely, because the online giant will be hard to pin down. Google does not earn any money with Android, which makes it difficult to calculate any potential damage awards and patent royalties.</p>\n<p> The frenzy of smart-phone litigation could last for years. The combatants have deep pockets and much to lose. Google is bounding ahead: Android now runs 32% of smart-phones sold in America, whereas Apple’s iPhone has only 25% of the market and the BlackBerry has 26%, according to Nielsen, another market research firm.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Nokia, which has already lost ground to Apple, cannot afford to see its intellectual property devalued. Should Nokia prevail, Apple may be slapped with $1 billion or so in licensing fees, estimates Christopher White of Bristol York, an investment bank.</p>\n<p>If the market for computing tablets (which are essentially oversized smart-phones) takes off as expected, there will be even more lawsuits. Apple is set to sell some 15m iPads by the end of the year. Gartner, a market-research firm, predicts that the overall tablet market will reach nearly 55m units in 2011.</p>\n<p>Eventually, even lawsuits must come to an end. How much harm they will cause remains to be seen. If Apple wins against HTC, that would be bad news for upstart handset firms. Until a few years ago, HTC only made devices for others, but now it has become a brand of its own. </p>\n<p>Litigation may also make smart-phones dearer. Mr White of Bristol York estimates that device makers already have to pay royalties for 200-300 patents for a typical smart-phone. Patent costs are 15-20% of its selling price, or about half of what the hardware components cost. “If 50 people [each] want 2% of a device’s value, we have a problem,” says Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a danger that the current intensity of litigation will become normal. Pessimists predict an everlasting patent war, much as the wider information-technology industry seems permanently embroiled in antitrust action. The Wright brothers’ legal skirmishes were put to rest only by the outbreak of the first world war. With luck, the smart-phone patent battles will end more quietly. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"Nasty legal spats between tech giants may be here to stay","id":"17309237"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Powering the tiger","title":"Privatising Coal India","content":"<p>GRABBING hot coals is usually a stupid thing to do. But investors who scrambled to buy shares in Coal India, a big state-run firm, thought their fingers safe enough. India’s biggest-ever initial public offering (IPO) was oversubscribed on its second day, October 19th. By selling 10% of its shares, the government raised about 150 billion rupees ($3.5 billion). The world’s largest coal producer, which extracted more than 430m tonnes last year, is one of India’s ten biggest firms by market value. Local newspapers crowed that India was now in the “IPO big league”.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly everyone seems happy. The government has a trainload of cash. Neither unions nor demagogues made much fuss. Reform-minded officials may take this as a green light to carry on quietly privatising other state-run enterprises, albeit slowly. And a few more Indians are now retail investors, encouraged by a small discount on the share price.</p>\n<p>Coal India’s prospects should also be bright. India’s accelerating economy is ravenously short of energy. With renewable fuels barely a flicker, the country will rely for decades on burning mountains of carbon. Coal India accounts for more than 80% of domestic production and controls 18 billion tonnes of reserves, most of India’s proven total. To expand, it plans to buy foreign mines and import more coal: it has set aside $1.2 billion for an overseas shopping trip, which may include pits in America, Australia and Indonesia.</p>\n  <p>However, the partially privatised Coal India could be much more productive. The firm used to be a sponge to soak up surplus east Indian labour. Its workforce has been cut by roughly a quarter in the past decade, but still numbers 400,000. </p>\n<p>The firm relies heavily on vast open-cast mines but is running short of appropriate places to dig (at least without antagonising gun-toting Naxalite rebels, who plague swathes of eastern India). It is also failing to extract coal from deeper seams. The coal it produces is mostly poor in quality and rich in ash; it should be washed before shipping to make it more efficient, but is not. India’s overloaded railways struggle to deliver enough coal to power stations. Government planners, rather than a market, allocate supplies and set prices and wages. As a result, coal that is nearly the world’s cheapest when dug up is nearly the priciest when it reaches a furnace.</p>\n<p>This creaky system struggles to deliver the half-a-billion tonnes of coal that Indians demand each year. If that demand eventually triples, as some predict, Coal India may not cope. Reformers hope that private investment will bring sharper scrutiny and better management. A better idea would have been to break Coal India’s quasi-monopoly and let rival firms vie to deliver coal cheaply. That was politically impossible, however. Greens may cheer, but many of the 400m Indians who lack electricity today will be left in the dark for longer than necessary.</p>","rubric":"India’s creaking coal industry celebrates the country’s biggest IPO","id":"17311913"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Thinking outside the car","title":"Daimler's innovation unit","content":"<p>IT WAS July 4th 2007 and Jérôme Guillen had spent America’s independence day climbing Mount Hood in Oregon. Back at his car, he found a voice-mail message: Dieter Zetsche, the head of Daimler, wanted to meet him urgently. When the Frenchman, then in charge of the design of a new American truck for the German carmaker, saw his boss, he was asked his thoughts on setting up an innovation unit to generate additional growth. A few days later he was given the job.</p>\n<p>The meeting came at an important time for Daimler, which had just extracted itself from a disastrous merger with Chrysler that had sapped its creativity and damaged its Mercedes-Benz brand. Before long, recession would add to its troubles. But adversity made the company more willing to embrace some of the odder ideas that Mr Guillen and his team came up with—especially those that ran against the longstanding conventional wisdom that the way for carmakers to grow is to encourage people to buy more cars. </p>\n<p>Two of the ideas are designed to make it easier for people to live without owning cars. Although the concept of hiring a car by the quarter-hour is not new, in most car-sharing schemes the vehicle must be reserved for a set amount of time and returned to its starting point. Daimler’s Car2Go scheme, however, allows people to pick up cars on a whim, use them for as long as they need to and drop them off wherever it is convenient. It relies on sophisticated software to match cars and drivers, even when hiring details are not known in advance. Car2Go is being tested in Ulm, a southern German town, and in Austin, Texas. Daimler is also using the idea as the basis for a bid to supply 3,000 electric cars for a sharing scheme in Paris.</p>\n  <p>The second idea looks something like a cross between Facebook, an internet dating site and a discount-flight broker. Car2gether matches people wanting to hitch a ride with drivers going the same way. In time it will allow cashless payments for the journeys, from which Daimler will take a small cut. Mr Guillen describes this as “broking empty seats”.</p>\n<p>These ideas seem more San Francisco than Stuttgart. But others seem to come straight from a business consultant’s playbook, a nod perhaps to the years Mr Guillen spent working as a turnaround specialist at McKinsey. One such idea is to allow existing Mercedes-Benz customers to hire demonstration models from showrooms. This may appeal to those who need a roomier car for a weekend trip or a sporty one to impress the opposite sex.</p>\n\n<p>To get approval, each project has to demonstrate that it will tap at least €100m ($140m) a year in revenue from a market worth at least €1 billion, and promise higher profit margins than usual. Some 25 projects are in the works, says Mr Guillen.</p>\n<p>Such promises may seem extravagant, yet five years ago Daimler set the wildly optimistic target of earning a 10% gross margin for Mercedes-Benz cars. That target was suspended during the financial crisis, but in the second quarter of this year the company came within a whisker of achieving it. Next year, it may beat it comfortably. More important, perhaps, than the success of any individual project is that Mr Guillen and his team are prepared to “think outside the car” no matter how threatening their ideas may seem.</p>","rubric":"After its disastrous American foray, Daimler is thinking more radically","id":"17311897"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Profiting from sexism","title":"Gender arbitrage in South Korea","content":"<p>“DO YOU know you have to give <em>everything</em> to become a TV announcer?” These words cost Kang Yong-seok, a member of South Korea’s parliament, his membership of the ruling Grand National Party in July. His insinuation that a woman must sleep her way to the top to work in television embarrassed his colleagues and set off a national debate about sexism.</p>\n<p>Working women in South Korea earn 63% of what men do. Not all of this is the result of discrimination, but some must be. South Korean women face social pressure to quit when they have children, making it hard to stay on the career fast track. Many large companies have no women at all in senior jobs. </p>\n<p>This creates an obvious opportunity. If female talent is undervalued, it should be plentiful and relatively cheap. Firms that hire more women should reap a competitive advantage. And indeed, there is evidence that one type of employer is doing just that. </p>\n  <p>Jordan Siegel of Harvard Business School reports that foreign multinationals are recruiting large numbers of educated Korean women. In South Korea, lifting the proportion of a firm’s managers who are female by ten percentage points raises its return on assets by one percentage point, Mr Siegel estimates.</p>\n<p>South Korea is the ideal environment for gender arbitrage. The workplace may be sexist, but the education system is extremely meritocratic. Lots of brainy female graduates enter the job market each year. In time their careers are eclipsed by those of men of no greater ability. This makes them poachable. Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, has more women than men in its office in Seoul.</p>\n<p>Only 60% of female South Korean graduates aged between 25 and 64 are in work—making educated South Korean women the most underemployed in OECD countries. That may change, however. Marriage and fertility rates have plunged. There were 10.6 marriages per 1,000 people in 1980, but only 6.2 last year. South Korean women have an average of only 1.15 children, one of the lowest rates anywhere. That has troubling implications for the country, but should help women in the workplace. Firms will have to use all the talent they can find. If they don’t, their rivals will.</p>","rubric":"If South Korean firms won’t make use of female talent, foreigners will","id":"17311877"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Ils ne passeront pas","title":"A Franco-German train tiff","content":"<p>ON DECEMBER 7th 1835 the <em>Adler</em>, a steam engine built by a British father and son, George and Robert Stephenson, puffed its way between Nuremberg and Fürth in Bavaria, marking the birth of the German railway system. On October 19th, a century and three-quarters later, the Germans repaid the compliment. Deutsche Bahn’s sleek high-speed train, the ICE 3, slid into London’s St Pancras station, the first German train to pass through the Channel tunnel, which links Britain to continental Europe.</p>\n<p>By happenstance the event coincided with a royal row brewing between the French and, it seems, almost everyone else keen on liberalising rail travel through the tunnel. Barely a mile away, as the Germans celebrated, Alstom, a French company, sought an injunction from Britain’s High Court against the award of a contract to its German rival Siemens, one of the makers of the ICE 3.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month Eurostar, the operator of passenger trains through the tunnel, named Siemens as its preferred bidder to build ten new high-speed trains. Alstom, which has supplied all Eurostar trains to date, cried foul. It claims the tender was invalid because it made assumptions about changes to safety regulations while they are still under discussion. Dominique Bussereau, the French secretary of state for transport, backed up the Alstom claim, saying the tender process was “null and void”. Alstom needed to file for an injunction before the contract with Siemens is signed on October 25th, say company sources. </p>\n  <p>The safety issue centres on whether trains of recent design, which have power sources distributed along their length, are as safe as those with power sources concentrated at their ends. The Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), which governs safety in the tunnel, considered the question last year and concluded that trains with distributed power would be acceptable so long as they were equipped to isolate a fire anywhere along their length. The IGC asked Eurotunnel, which operates the tunnel, to work out detailed rules to take this into account. Eurotunnel expects to draw up the rules by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Alstom says that it raised concerns months ago that inviting bids for trains with distributed power before these rules were clarified was jumping the gun. The company nevertheless submitted a bid in a tendering process which it now argues is illegal. Eurostar is not prepared to change its decision, which company sources say is “the right one for our customers”. The state-owned French railway, SNCF, which owns 55% of Eurostar, has not commented.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bahn is not involved in the row, but its ICE trains work on distributed power. Amusingly, because of the still unchanged regulations, the visiting ICE 3 was propelled through the tunnel by two other locomotives, one at each end. </p>\n<p>The train was also subjected to a rigorous safety exercise in the tunnel. Hundreds of people were evacuated from its two 200-metre sections in the space of 20 minutes, to take refuge in a central service tunnel. The maximum time allowed for such an evacuation is 90 minutes. Last December, when an Alstom Eurostar train had to be evacuated because of engine failure, it took 35 minutes.</p>\n<p>Since January, the operation of international passenger rail services has been liberalised throughout the European Union. By 2013 Deutsche Bahn plans to run one that whizzes from London to Cologne in four hours, and to Frankfurt in five. Competitors sense that Alstom’s concerns are more about commerce than safety.</p>","rubric":"Trains under the Channel cause a storm","id":"17311923"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Attack of the biosimilars","title":"Pharmaceuticals","content":"<p>GENERIC drugs are the scourge of the pharmaceutical industry. So it is ironic that the next great opportunity for traditional drugs firms is to do to the biotechnology interlopers exactly what the generics firms have done to them: shred their profit margins with cheaper copies. </p>\n<p>This battle is foreshadowed in a deal announced on October 18th by Pfizer, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical firm. It will work with Biocon, India’s largest biotech company, to bring “biosimilar” insulin treatments to market. Biosimilars are generic impersonations (although not identical copies) of biotech drugs. And as if to remind the world that new ideas don’t all come from America, it is the Indian firm that will design and manufacture the original drugs; Pfizer will only market them.</p>\n<p>This is part of a new strategy to become a “one-stop shop” for biosimilars, explains David Simmons of Pfizer. Biosimilars are a hot new area. Although biotech-based drugs account for only a fifth or so of global drugs sales they are projected to grow at double-digit rates as sales of many conventional drugs decline, especially with a large number of patent expirations coming. Add the fact that many biotech drugs produce enormous profits—some treatments cost $100,000 or more per year—and it is easy to see why the sector looks like a juicy target for generic assault. </p>\n  <p>Yet some traditional generics firms are piling in too. Sales of biosimilars at Sandoz, a generics arm of Novartis, a Swiss drugs giant, reached $118m in 2009. Jeff George, Sandoz’s boss, says they leapt 72% during the first half of 2010. William Marth of Israel’s Teva, the world’s biggest generics firm, insists that biosimilars are a “natural segue” for his company and predicts that sales will reach $800m by 2015. Cipla, an Indian generics maker, and China’s Desano Pharma are also getting into the biosimilars business. </p>\n<p>Generics firms will do better with biosimilars than they have with conventional generic drugs, insists Viren Mehta, an industry expert. Sandoz’s Mr George says the leading generics firms have access to better technologies now and have made doctors and patients comfortable with using copies of drugs. However, he acknowledges one potential snag: complexity. </p>\n<p>The science involved in making biosimilars is much more complicated than that in making ordinary generics, says Andrew Pasternak of Bain &amp; Company, a consultancy. A typical generic drug may cost a few million dollars to develop, he estimates, but a biosimilar version could cost perhaps $100m-150m. And because biosimilars are not exact copies, many countries may not allow them to be automatically substituted for the pricier originals, as generic drugs often are in some countries.</p>\n<p>This complexity hands the advantage to the old pharmaceutical giants. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, head of Biocon, says the “easy substitution” that generics firms enjoy at the pharmacy does not work with complex biosimilars—which require a doctor’s approval to dispense. </p>\n<p>The big drugs companies will benefit from that because they have marketing machines and large technical sales forces to persuade doctors to prescribe a drug. Michael Kamarck of Merck, an American drugs firm which moved into biosimilars in 2008, thinks the barriers to entry are so great that “only a handful” of firms will be able to pull it off.</p>\n<p>Yet the outcome may not be so simple. As the Pfizer deal with Biocon suggests, both sides may need partners. That is because there is an obstacle to biosimilars even more formidable than cost: lawsuits. Biosimilars threaten incumbent biotech firms such as Amgen and Genentech (now part of Roche, a Swiss drugs giant), which have billions of dollars of sales at risk, argues Mr Pasternak. Big biotech will fight hard to defend its patch, he predicts.</p>","rubric":"Biotechnology drugs are the next target for cheaper versions","id":"17316667"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Bling is back","title":"Luxury goods","content":"<p>“IN THE dark days of the recession people didn’t want to show the bling,” says Alisa Moussaieff, owner and managing director of Moussaieff, a London jewellery shop. Some of her wealthy customers bought diamonds or other gems as an investment during the financial crisis, since paper assets seemed so dodgy at the time. Rather than flaunting their purchases before recession-pinched passers-by, however, they asked for plain white shopping bags. As the global economy mends, such restraint is wearing off. Yet even the luxury industry’s boosters did not expect such a cork-popping recovery. </p>\n<p>On October 14th Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), the world’s biggest luxury-goods company by sales, reported a 14% increase in sales in the first nine months of the year, after correcting for such factors as currency fluctuation. Burberry, a British clothing firm, also reported double-digit sales growth in the six months to the end of the September. On October 28th, PPR, a French retail and luxury group, is expected to report strong results. </p>\n<p>“The strength of the recovery was a surprise,” says Claudia D’Arpizio, a luxury-goods expert in the Milan office of Bain &amp; Company, a consultancy. Big brands such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès are the main winners. With their deep pockets, they were able to continue to open new shops and invest in the business during the crisis.</p>\n  <p>Luxury has always been a cyclical industry, but in the past decade it has soared and plunged like a well-dressed bungee-jumper. The early 2000s were grim: terrorist attacks in America, a global outbreak of SARS and the war in Iraq all tempered people’s appetites for international travel and frivolous purchases. From 2004 to 2007, however, luxury shoppers worked themselves into a frenzy of indulgence. Then, as the financial crisis bit, they stopped. Last year the global luxury market shrank by 8%. But the luxury recovery that began towards the end of 2009 has now gathered momentum. Bain predicts 10% growth for this year. </p>\n<p>Pockets of confidence in America help. Luxury sales there slumped by 18% last year. This year shoppers are feeling less shy about showing off, and department stores are gleefully stocking up with pretty stuff for the holiday season. </p>\n<p>The mood in China is even blingier. Luxury sales grew 20% even during the industry’s <em>annus horribilis</em> last year and are forecast to boom by an astounding 30% this year. In five years China, which already accounts for a tenth of global demand for luxury goods, is predicted to be the third-largest market for them.</p>\n<p>The boom has caught some firms with their elegant trousers down. Despite nationwide strikes in France, Louis Vuitton, a peddler of posh handbags, does not have sufficient stock to cater to the sudden increase in demand. Anxious to save enough goodies for Christmas, the company is closing its flagship shop on the Champs-Elysées in Paris earlier each day and raising its prices in the euro zone.</p>\n<p>Yet the good times for luxury firms will probably not last. Next year Bain predicts that growth will slow to 3-5%. The strength of the euro will hurt the top firms, which are disproportionately Italian or French and often lovingly hand-craft their products within the euro area. Tax increases in Europe will make the rich feel poorer and less inclined to splash out. Consumer confidence is crucial.

Annoyingly for retailers, so do Indians without money. A new survey of retailers in 42 countries by Britain’s Centre for Retail Research found the highest level of “shrinkage” (losses from shoplifting, theft by workers and accounting errors) in India. Goods worth 2.72% of sales went walkabout. In Taiwan, the best performer, only 0.87% did.</p>\n<p>This is not because India is a nation of tea leaves. It is because Indian shops have not yet learned how to protect their stock. Fifteen years ago Taiwanese shops had one of the worst rates of shrinkage in the world, but they took measures to improve it. Joshua Bamfield, the author of the survey, says he is confident that India can do the same. </p>\n<p>Globally, shrinkage cost retailers $107 billion in the year to June. This was 5.6% less than the previous year, but still the equivalent of 1.36% of sales. In America, light-fingered employees are a bigger problem than thieving shoppers. In Europe, it is the other way around. Worldwide, crooked staff have better opportunities to steal than ordinary shoppers. Per incident, they pinch ten times more.</p>\n\n  <p>When it comes to thwarting thieves, shop-owners are on their own. In most countries the criminal justice system has all but given up trying to punish shoplifters. Even in Britain, which is not shy of locking people up, only 5,000-10,000 of the roughly 450,000 who are arrested every year go to jail, and then for an average of 2.2 months. So retailers install CCTV cameras, attach so-called electronic article surveillance tags to their wares, train their staff to spot thieves and screen workers for criminal records before hiring them. This year retailers spent $26.8 billion, or 0.34% of sales, on preventing theft.</p>\n<p>Some dismiss shoplifting simply as a cost of doing business. Yet it can be serious. Some shoplifters work in organised gangs. Some turn violent when interrupted. Some, especially those who are hooked on drugs, are persistent and prolific. And all impose a cost on honest shoppers. Theft inflates the average family’s annual shopping bill by $186. </p>","rubric":"Shops can thwart thieves, but it costs money","id":"17309217"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Business","headline":"Companies aren’t charities","title":"Schumpeter","content":"<p>STEVE COOGAN, a British comedian, once told a joke about David Beckham, a footballer who is unlikely to win a Nobel prize for physics: “They say, ‘Oh, David Beckham—he’s not very clever.’ Yeah. They don’t say, ‘Stephen Hawking—shit at football.’” Successful corporations are like Mr Beckham. Both excel at one thing: in Mr Beckham’s case, kicking a ball; in the corporations’ case, making profits. They may also be reasonably adept at other things, such as modelling sunglasses or forming task forces to solve environmental problems. But their chief contribution to society comes from their area of specialisation. </p>\n<p>Ann Bernstein, the head of a South African think-tank called the Centre for Development and Enterprise, thinks that advocates of corporate social responsibility (CSR) tend to miss this point. In her new book, “The Case for Business in Developing Economies”, she stresses the ways companies benefit society simply by going about their normal business. In a free and competitive market, firms profit by selling goods or services to willing customers. To stay in business, they must offer lower prices or higher quality than their competitors. Those that fail disappear. Those that succeed spread prosperity. Shareholders receive dividends. Employees earn wages. Suppliers win contracts. Ordinary people gain access to luxuries that would have made Cecil Rhodes gasp, such as television, air-conditioning and antibiotics. </p>\n<p>These are not new arguments, but Ms Bernstein makes them fresh by writing from an African perspective. Citizens of rich countries often fret about the occasional harm that corporations do, yet take for granted the prosperity they create. People in developing countries do not have that luxury. </p>\n  <p>In South Africa, where more than a third of the workforce is jobless, the problem is not that corporations are unethical but that there are not enough of them. One reason is that South Africa’s leaders blithely heap social responsibilities on corporate shoulders. Strict environmental laws cause long delays in building homes. This is nice for endangered butterflies, but tough for South Africans who live in shacks. Such laws also slow the construction of power plants, contributing to the rolling blackouts that crippled South Africa in 2008. South African labour laws make it hard to fire workers, which deters companies from hiring them in the first place. And a programme of “Black Economic Empowerment”, which pressures firms to transfer shares to blacks, has made a few well-connected people rich while discouraging investment. Ms Bernstein ducks this last topic, which is highly sensitive in her home country.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the pressure on business to solve social problems comes, not from governments, but from non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Ms Bernstein cites the example of a pipeline that Exxon built in Chad. The giant oil firm spent six years trying to figure out the best way to comply with the “Equator principles”, an ambitious set of goals for avoiding harm to nature and indigenous people. Exxon strained every sinew to preserve gorillas’ habitat and compensate displaced villagers. Yet NGOs still mounted a furious campaign condemning it. “Many reasonable companies must surely have concluded…that investment in poor countries is not worth the effort,” sighs Ms Bernstein. </p>\n<p>Anti-corporate activists sometimes claim that big companies are mightier than governments. This is absurd. Governments can pass laws, raise taxes and declare war. Companies have virtually no powers of coercion. If people do not voluntarily buy their products, they go bankrupt. Business is thus extremely sensitive to public opinion. This is often a good thing. Ms Bernstein cites the example of white-owned shops in South Africa under apartheid. When black shoppers started boycotting them, “it was remarkable how rapidly most white shop owners were prepared to ditch racist practices.” Yet companies can also be bullied into doing the wrong thing. When multinationals bow to pressure from campaigners against “sweatshops” and sever links with suppliers in poor countries, the workers who previously stitched shoes for export may end up scavenging from rubbish heaps. </p>\n<p><a name=\"accountable_to_all_means_accountable_to_none\"></a><br><strong>Accountable to all means accountable to none</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Advocates of CSR argue that firms should pursue the “triple bottom line”: not only profits, but also environmental protection and social justice. This notion, if taken seriously, is “incomprehensible”, says Ms Bernstein. Profits are easy to measure. The many and often conflicting demands of a local community are not. A business that is accountable to all is in effect accountable to no one, says Ms Bernstein. </p>\n<p>She does not take the absolutist view that companies should strive only to maximise profits while obeying the rules. In poor countries, the rules are often unclear. Multinationals will face choices where what is locally acceptable would be criminal back home. Obviously, they should err on the side of rectitude, but it is far from obvious where to draw the line. In the most benighted areas they will sometimes build roads and schools to keep the locals friendly. They will brag about such acts, but they are simply a cost of doing business, not an instance of corporate altruism.</p>\n<p>Ms Bernstein glosses over the innovative work a few companies have done in integrating CSR into their strategy, and she is better at identifying problems than offering solutions. She urges businesses to defend capitalism as energetically as they promote their own products. She thinks companies should provide incentives for market-oriented journalism, films and even novels. Good luck with that. Businesses strenuously lobby for particular favours from government, and chambers of commerce campaign for lighter regulation. But the companies that are so brilliant at selling the fruits of capitalism—from iPads to medicine—are seldom much good at popularising the system that yields them. </p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"In poor countries the problem is not that businesses are unethical but that there are too few of them","id":"17305554"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Briefings2","headline":"Stars of the junkyard","title":"Drexel Burnham Lambert's legacy","content":"<p>IN JANUARY 2007 Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which manages George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and other film-industry luminaries, opened its new offices on Avenue of the Stars in Century City, Los Angeles. As famous actors and directors file into the marble-lined entrance to strike lucrative film contracts, even more serious money is being made upstairs. </p>\n<p>The 12th floor is occupied by Ares, which has $37 billion of funds invested in private equity, high-yield bonds and other corporate debt. One floor down is Canyon Partners, an alternative-investment firm that manages $18 billion. The CAA building is also home to Imperial Capital, a boutique investment bank. All three firms can trace their origins to Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that collapsed into bankruptcy in 1990, fatally wounded by an insider-trading scandal. </p>\n<p>Twenty years ago next month Michael Milken, Drexel’s most talented and best-paid financier, who was based in Los Angeles, was sentenced to ten years in prison after pleading guilty to six counts of securities fraud. His sentence was later commuted and he was released in 1992 after serving 22 months. He was also forced to pay much of the huge bonuses he earned at Drexel in fines and settlements. </p>\n  <p>It is rare even in Hollywood to find a star that rose and fell so quickly. For much of the 1980s Drexel was the hottest firm in investment banking, thanks to its dominance of the market for high-yield corporate bonds, of which Mr Milken was king. These bonds were known as “junk” because they were ranked below investment grade by ratings agencies. Drexel used its muscle in high-yield bond trading, which Mr Milken had built up in the 1970s, to push into other areas of investment banking such as mergers and acquisitions and underwriting. By 1986 Drexel, which in its long history had not previously threatened to join the financial elite, was Wall Street’s most profitable firm. </p>\n<p>But Drexel slumped under the weight of legal battles and the $650m fine it agreed on with the American government to settle an investigation of alleged securities fraud. When Mr Milken was forced out at the end of 1988, the firm lost its biggest source of revenue. His acumen was missed all the more as the junk-bond market started to implode at the end of that decade. Rising interest rates, defaults on bonds that had been issued too readily in the go-go years and new regulations that forced troubled savings-and-loans to unload their high-yield holdings all conspired to drive junk-bond prices down. This seemed only to validate claims that the junk-bond market was a Ponzi scheme perpetuated by Mr Milken’s tight control of it. </p>\n<p>Those claims turned out to be false. Drexel has left three enduring legacies: a junk-bond market that has grown at least sevenfold since the firm’s demise; the firms and industries, from gambling to cable television, that owed their rapid expansion to the investment bank’s junk bonds; and the influence of the “Drexel diaspora”, the young MBA graduates who worked in the 1980s under Mr Milken, on the finance industry in Los Angeles and elsewhere.</p>\n<p><a name=\"bust_to_boom\"></a><br><strong>Bust to boom</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In 1990 the outstanding stock of junk bonds (estimated by subtracting redemptions from new registered issues since 1970) was about $150 billion. Now the total is over $1 trillion. Around two-fifths of all outstanding corporate bonds in America are rated as “speculative”, or below investment grade (BB+ or lower), according to Dealogic, a financial-data firm. Even better-class bonds are not as pukka as they once were: much of the non-junk issued since 1992 has been rated BBB-, the lowest investment grade.</p>\n<p>Like all other credit, the junk-bond market was badly damaged during the recession. But it has bounced back, just as it did in the early 1990s and early 2000s. This year new issuance has surged: with around $200 billion raised in America already, the total for 2010 is sure to be a record (see chart 1). The revival is in part driven by a renewed search for yield by investors disappointed with the poor returns on cash or Treasuries: the interest premium they demand for holding junk has tumbled (see chart 2). </p>\n\n<p>The reopening of the junk-bond market has also afforded medium-sized firms access to credit again. The businesses that have tapped the market are a cross-section of corporate America: airlines, clothing manufacturers and retailers, health-care providers, drug firms, restaurant chains, oil-exploration firms and semiconductor manufacturers. Some of the new issuance is by firms looking to lock in long-term financing on good terms. </p>\n<p>The market’s revival has been helped by fewer defaults on high-yield bonds. The default rate on junk bonds stayed above 8% for 14 months in 2009-10, according to CreditSights, a research firm. That compares with 20 months in the previous two recessions.</p>\n<p>Junk bonds, once despised, are now mainstream. “Milken and Drexel took high-yield bonds from a cottage industry to one of the cornerstones of the financial industry,” says Howard Marks, one of Mr Milken’s early customers and now chairman of Oaktree, a Los Angeles firm that manages around $75 billion in funds, much of it in high-yield bonds and related investments.</p>\n<p><a name=\"catch_a_falling_star\"></a><br><strong>Catch a falling star</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the 1970s the market for such bonds was tiny. It comprised “fallen angels”, the securities of former investment-grade companies that had fallen on hard times, which changed hands infrequently and at big discounts to face value. While a student at Berkeley in the late 1960s, Mr Milken came across empirical support for his hunch that a portfolio of these high-yield bonds would outperform an investment-grade portfolio, even taking into account the higher likelihood of default. He found it in a study by Braddock Hickman, a central banker and student of corporate finance, which showed that even during the Depression there was a high rate of return on non-investment-grade bonds. The interest-rate spread over supposedly safer bonds was more than enough compensation for the higher expected losses. </p>\n<p>When Mr Milken began to trade junk bonds at Drexel from the early 1970s, his pitch to his growing band of clients and followers was always the same: junk was a better bet than investment-grade bonds, which had only one way to go: down. High-yield bonds proved to be resilient in the mid-1970s recession. Such was the meltdown in financial markets that in 1974, when the value of equities fell by half, some bonds could be purchased for the price of their coupon. Yet remarkably few junk bonds went bad and investors achieved high rates of return.</p>\n<p>This set the stage for the opening of a sizeable market for new junk issues in 1977. From then on fallen angels would be traded alongside “ascending angels”: the bonds of firms whose prospects were better than their lowly status suggested. Interest rates were volatile and firms wanted to fix their cost of capital. They were wary of relying on banks, which had cut lines of credit to firms at the nadir of the recession to preserve their capital. </p>\n\n<p>In April that year Drexel underwrote its first junk-bond issue when it raised $30m for Texas International, a small oil-exploration company. Other issues followed that year but other investment banks initially took a larger share of this new market. That lead did not last (see chart 3). Mr Milken’s preaching of the high-yield gospel secured him a loyal and growing customer base, mostly among insurers and thrifts, with an insatiable demand for low-grade securities. He helped his customers make money. If they did well, they came back for more and in time they built their businesses on the supply of securities from Drexel. </p>\n<p>The key to their loyalty was Mr Milken’s commitment to buy or sell on demand the bonds that Drexel had underwritten: he thus offered them a liquid market and a way out of investments they no longer wanted. That liquidity attracted mutual funds into the junk arena. Mr Milken’s skill as a marketmaker was rooted in his knowledge of the bonds issued (which allowed him to price them accurately) and his extraordinary recollection of his clients’ holdings (which helped him find new buyers for junk that others wanted to unload). And he stuck around when other banks retreated from the junk market during the early 1980s recession. </p>\n<p>This fresh junk became an important weapon for the corporate raiders and leveraged-buy-out (LBO) firms that came to prominence in the 1980s. Drexel’s ability quickly to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in “mezzanine” debt (so called because it ranks between secure bank loans and at-risk equity in the capital structure) made the threat of buy-outs credible and forced many big companies to slim costs and increase returns to shareholders to stave off the threat of takeover. </p>\n<p>Drexel found much of the mezzanine financing in 1989 for the $25 billion purchase by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, a buy-out firm, of RJR Nabisco, a cigarette-and-biscuit conglomerate. It was an example of both Drexel’s daring and the muscle the firm had at its peak. “We sat around and said if every one of our existing customers buys the maximum amount they have ever bought of one issue, we could get $3 billion,” says Dana Messina, once a high-yield salesman at Drexel, now the chief executive of Steinway Musical Instruments. Drexel comfortably raised $6 billion to finance the deal.</p>\n<p><a name=\"fertilised_by_junk\"></a><br><strong>Fertilised by junk</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Junk-bond issues also offered a new way for many small but growing firms, which had been starved of capital by stodgy commercial banks and sniffy investment banks, to finance themselves. “The bread-and-butter business was catering to guys like Craig McCaw or Steve Wynn or John Malone or Ted Turner,” says Mr Messina.</p>\n<p>These entrepreneurs saw the growth potential in their respective industries. Mr McCaw was head of McCaw Cellular Communications, an early entrant to the mobile-phone business, which had 2m subscribers by the time AT&amp;T bought it in 1994 for $11.5 billion. Drexel also funded Bill McGowan’s MCI, the firm which successfully challenged AT&amp;T’s fixed-line telephone monopoly. Drexel financed Mr Wynn’s Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City and the Mirage in Las Vegas, replete with a fake volcano. His firm now owns several luxury hotels in Las Vegas, a city whose rapid growth owed much to high-yield finance. Mr Malone’s Tele-Communications Inc became the biggest cable-TV firm in the world. Its growth was financed by Drexel-issued junk. Mr Turner pioneered 24-hour news television at CNN, a channel powered by junk. Rupert Murdoch was another media client.</p>\n<p>“None of the firms we financed were pure start-ups,” says Ken Moelis, who worked in Drexel’s corporate-finance team in Los Angeles and who started Moelis &amp; Co, an investment bank, in 2007. Rather Drexel found money for small firms which had enough cashflow to meet interest payments to grow bigger. Some industries were not well-suited for debt finance: the mobile-phone business did not generate much upfront cash and cable-TV firms had big start-up costs before subscription revenue flowed. One solution was to “over-fund” firms, to raise more capital than they needed so that they could make their initial interest payments. Another trick was to use zero-coupon bonds, on which interest payments are deferred until the principal comes due. </p>\n<p>Not all Drexel’s corporate customers were thrilled with the price extracted for this service. Some felt that Drexel cut too good a deal for itself and for Mr Milken’s loyal junk-bond investors. Drexel’s fees on junk issues were 3-4%; less than 1% was typical for investment-grade bonds. Drexel’s bankers often demanded equity warrants for themselves and their buyers to sweeten the deal.</p>\n<p>Yet lopsided pricing is a feature of “two-sided markets”, in which one side benefits if there are lots of customers on the other side. For instance, clubs that act as matchmakers for lonely hearts often levy higher charges on men than on women, judging that single men will be keener to join clubs with lots of female members. In a similar way, Drexel was able to charge an enviable fee for access to a scarce investor base. Most firms were willing to pay. “For a lot of issuers, it wasn’t the cost of money. It was the cost of not having it,” says Kyle Kirkland, who was one of the last MBA graduates hired by Drexel’s Beverly Hills office in the 1980s. </p>\n<p>The desire to maintain Mr Milken’s hold on high-yield marketmaking may explain why Drexel’s bankers were loth to share deals with other investment banks. If competitors issued lots of junk bonds, that would undermine Mr Milken’s sense of who held what bonds and make control of the market harder. The firm gloried in thwarting rivals and in stealing business from under the noses of a Wall Street “elite” it viewed as snooty and indolent. </p>\n\n<p>The firm had plenty of enemies who welcomed its downfall. The firm’s ability swiftly to raise vast sums for LBOs struck fear into the heart of corporate America. The job losses that often followed a junk-financed buy-out, as hitherto inefficient firms were sweated for cash, created a lot of political fury. (That far more jobs were created by the small firms that Drexel financed than were lost in LBOs is often overlooked.) “Junk bonds, junk people” was the sneer from Wall Streeters who loathed the upstart bank. Drexel’s retort, that its rivals would prefer to sell investment-grade bonds on their ratings, rather than put in the hours of analysis needed to hawk junk, was hardly endearing. Drexel also provided a useful scapegoat for the savings-and-loan crisis, because some thrifts were keen buyers of junk bonds. </p>\n<p>Yet unloved as it was, Drexel changed the face of corporate finance and of Wall Street. “These days with firms, such as Google and Apple, everyone takes dynamism for granted,” says Mr Moelis. “But Mike Milken started out in the 1970s when capitalism was struggling. In those days, there was very little innovation. Along comes Drexel, a firm with a visionary purpose, and suddenly you could get capital.” Before 1977, when new junk-bond issues took off, says Mr Marks, non-investment-grade bonds were thought of as “bad” investments, at any price. Nowadays a bad credit can be considered a prudent investment if it is available at the right price. </p>\n<p>Drexel’s third legacy is in the mark it left on the finance industry, particularly in Los Angeles. That Drexel’s most profitable division was based so far from its headquarters in New York is largely down to the accident of Mr Milken’s birth. Born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, Mr Milken returned to Los Angeles in 1978 (taking 20 or so traders with him) to be closer to his family. Since he was the main source of the firm’s profits at the time, his masters could scarcely refuse him. </p>\n<p><a name=\"descendants_of_drexel\"></a><br><strong>Descendants of Drexel</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With Mr Milken at its centre, Drexel’s Beverly Hills operation became a magnet for the best business-school graduates in the late 1980s. That cohort of financiers is still active. Many of them stayed in Los Angeles after Drexel folded. Almost all have now moved to the asset-management side of the business, although the sell-side skills they developed at Drexel are useful in bringing in money to manage or in arranging outside co-financing for private-equity deals. Los Angeles no longer has a big “money centre” bank or a big broker. What stayed was an innovative strain of Drexel-style “next-stage” finance. Local financiers say they are free of the herd mentality that can take hold in New York. The weather and the quality of life help too: firms say they find it harder to recruit, but easier to retain, good staff. </p>\n<p>Some Drexel alumni are found today in New York. Rich Handler, a junk-bond trader in Drexel’s Los Angeles office, moved with 35 or so colleagues to Jefferies, a local investment bank; they took their knowledge of high-yield bonds and investors with them. Mr Handler is now Jefferies’s chief executive but the bank has long outgrown its Los Angeles and high-yield roots. In 1990 it had 400 employees. It now has around 3,000, of whom 200 are based in Los Angeles: the headquarters these days are in New York. Another alumnus is Leon Black, founder of Apollo, a corporate-credit firm with $55 billion under management. Apollo is based in New York, where Mr Black also spent his Drexel years.</p>\n<p>Drexel’s financiers were not altruists; they were dealmakers. But in their search for profit they also brought about a democratisation of credit. Firms that previously had to rely on conservative banks or expensive equity were given access to fixed-interest funds in capital markets by the investors that Mr Milken and his junk-bond traders had cultivated. This was a boon to the American economy: limiting capital to investment-grade firms limits economic progress. If a firm can pay the rate for its risk, it should get the money it needs.</p>\n<p>Los Angeles is perhaps a curious home for a group of financiers with such a focus on high-yield credit. The Hollywood business model is a search for a blockbuster that will pay for all the turkeys. High-yield bond investment is a different art: the trick is to avoid the losers; then the winners will take care of themselves. </p>","rubric":"Twenty years after Michael Milken’s junk-bond firm came crashing down, the financial revolution that it fostered lives on","id":"17306419"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Take that","title":"Terra Firma and Citigroup","content":"<p>WHEN Terra Firma, a European private-equity firm, was considering buying EMI Group, a big music company, it referred to the potential deal by the code name “Project Dice”.

Mr Hands alleges that David Wormsley, an investment banker at Citigroup, tricked him into paying more for EMI by saying that a rival private-equity firm was still planning to bid for it even though the other firm had dropped out. Citigroup denies the charge, saying that Mr Hands is a sophisticated investor who made a poor decision.</p>\n<p>So far during the trial, both sides have tried to portray their clients as sympathetic characters. When Mr Hands took the stand on October 19th he recounted that his mother had been a nursery-school teacher, and that as a child he had been diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disorder, and dyspraxia, a motor disorder. (He chose not to highlight the fact that he has taken up residence in Guernsey so he can avoid Britain’s high taxes.) It is unclear, however, whether the nine jurors will see much humanity on either side. The jury includes a doorman and a caseworker for a Catholic charity. They are far removed from the world of leveraged finance. </p>\n      \n  <p>The trial has laid bare the wounds that buy-out firms and banks still nurse after the financial crisis. Both Terra Firma and Citi have a lot at stake in the case. Terra Firma needs money to help prop up EMI and its own business. Although the buy-out firm has not specified how much it is seeking in damages, some estimate that it is hoping for as much as £5.3 billion. If Terra Firma loses it may have no other choice but to hand EMI over to Citi. A loss for Citi, meanwhile, would be a big blow to its reputation as an honest broker for its clients. It could also set an unhappy precedent for other lenders: how many buy-out firms that regret the high prices they paid during the boom might come forward to sue the banks that led them on?</p>\n<p>As Terra Firma and Citi spar over the details of the past, however, others in the industry prefer to talk about the future. “It’s incredible how far and how fast we’ve come back,” says Adam Sokoloff of the financial-sponsors group at Jefferies, an investment bank. Deal activity is on the rise. So far this year there have been nearly $147 billion-worth of deals, up by 118% from the same time last year though far below peak levels. The number of deals is up, too. </p>\n\n<p>Buy-out firms are also returning to some of their more controversial practices. Take dividend recapitalisations, in which private-equity firms put more debt into a company and take out equity to pay themselves and investors (see chart). Ratings agencies do not look favourably on dividend recapitalisations. They can endanger weak companies and firms in cyclical industries, which do not have stable cashflow to pay down the additional debt. But private-equity firms are anxious to return money to their profit-starved investors and take some cash for themselves too, after a barren few years. So far this year private-equity firms have paid themselves $9.1 billion in dividends, up from $700m in all of 2009. </p>\n<p>This revival is only possible because the credit markets have become more robust. A rapid recovery in the financing market has helped fuel private-equity transactions. The high-yield debt market, which helped finance a wave of leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s (see <a href=\"/node/17306419\">article</a>), is back, fuelled by investor appetite for yield. So far this year around $300 billion in such debt has been issued, a record, according to Dealogic, a research firm. </p>\n<p>That has enabled buy-out firms to start dialling back the amount of equity they put into portfolio companies. For large corporate buy-outs in the third quarter of this year, the equity contribution was around 38%, down from nearly 47% in 2009. “Between bank debt and high-yield debt, debt levels are back to the high end of normalised levels” for buy-out transactions, says Scott Sperling, co-president of THL, a private-equity firm. That has led some to predict that a $10 billion private-equity deal, which has not been seen in years, might soon be possible. The largest deal so far this year was Colony Capital’s $6.7 billion purchase of Inmobiliaria Colonial, a Spanish property firm.</p>\n<p>The private-equity industry may be regaining some of its bravado but it has not gone back to its glory days. Much of the revival in deal activity reflects a build-up in the capital that firms hold. Preqin, a research firm, estimates that buy-out firms have around $456 billion in unspent capital or “dry powder”. They need to put this money to work before the investment period for their funds is supposed to end. </p>\n<p>That has driven up prices. In the third quarter the average purchase-price multiple for a large buy-out was 9.1 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EDITDA), higher than in 2006. Usually during the early stage of a recovery private-equity firms are able to buy companies at cheaper prices, leading to greater profits on those investments later. That may not be true this time.</p>\n<p>A sustained rebound for private equity will depend on firms’ ability to raise new funds. Those that have had very public embarrassments may find it more difficult to attract fresh capital. Mr Hands knows this, which is why he is fighting to clear his firm’s reputation in court. But the past weighs on others in the industry, too. </p>","rubric":"Are private-equity firms able to escape their past?","id":"17314604"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Goalless draw","title":"Alternative investments in Europe","content":"<p>A PATIENT leaving the dentist will insist, through painfully gritted teeth, that they feel just fine, thanks, lest the drill comes out again. Hedge funds and private-equity firms are also mouthing a quiet “thanks, can we go now?” over rules to govern them agreed on by European finance ministers on October 19th. </p>\n<p>The rules, which still need to be approved by the European Parliament, come after 18 months of squabbling that pitted the industry against lawmakers, and Europe’s economic liberals against its anti-market wing. The result is a relatively bloodless compromise. Although hedge funds and private-equity firms played almost no part in causing the financial crisis, politicians in places like Berlin and Paris can claim to be reining in “speculators”. The industry can point to the fact that the new rules are not nearly as heavy-handed as those first proposed or under debate just six months ago. </p>\n<p>Subject to agreement by the European Parliament the rules will impose a number of constraints on the industry. Under the auspices of the European Securities and Markets Authority, a new Paris-based body, regulators will be able, for instance, to limit how much hedge funds and private-equity firms can borrow if it appears that risk is building up in the financial system. Hedge funds will also have to disclose more information about their holdings; private-equity firms will have to release information on the finances of the companies they own. </p>\n  <p>In return for greater scrutiny fund managers—including, after a longer transition period, those from outside the European Union—will be able to acquire a “passport” to operate more easily across all EU countries. Earlier drafts of the rules had suggested that non-EU funds would have to get permission from each of the countries they wanted to enter. This issue was pivotal, not just because the earlier versions risked alienating America by discriminating against its large hedge-fund industry, but also because it could have restricted the choices of European investors. </p>\n<p>There are still gaps in the rules to be fleshed out.

China surpassed all of these targets by 1957, the plan’s final year. Will China’s 12th plan, spanning 2011 to 2015, fare as well? The full blueprint will not be released until next spring. But a communiqué on October 18th offered a few early glimpses of its contents.</p>\n<p>The new plan looks set to pick up where the previous one left off. That is not as conservative as it sounds, because the 11th plan (2006-10) was daring in conception, if not always in implementation. By 2006, of course, the share of GDP governed by Soviet-style central planning had shrunk dramatically. The 11th plan even dropped the term, replacing the word <em>jihua</em>, used to describe previous plans, with the term <em>guihua</em>, suggesting a long-range programme or strategy.</p>\n<p>The 11th plan also introduced a distinction between hard targets (for energy efficiency, pollution and population) that officials were obliged to meet, and more indicative targets (for growth, employment and other things) that the economy was expected to meet of its own accord. And it replaced the single-minded pursuit of growth with “all-round” development, hoping to contain pollution and arrest widening economic inequalities.</p>\n\n  <p>China’s leaders still count on “relatively rapid” growth to keep the social peace. Their last plan envisaged annual growth of 7.5%. That proved hugely bearish. In fact, GDP has grown by over 10% a year on average since 2006 (see chart). It expanded by “only” 9.6% in the year to the third quarter, according to figures released this week. But it is already showing signs of quickening again, prompting the central bank on October 19th to lift interest rates, by 0.25 percentage points, for the first time since 2007.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its irrepressible growth, China’s national income is bigger than its planners expected. But it is not distributed as they would like. In their communiqué, party leaders promised to give more of the pie to wage-earners. That would help more “harmonious labour relations”, which were rattled by strikes and suicides over the summer, and also boost consumption, which accounted for 35.1% of GDP last year compared with about 50% in South Korea at a similar stage of development.</p>\n<p>Promoting consumption has been a goal of China’s leaders since 2004. In the years since, it has fallen as a share of GDP. It may be that China’s modern, strategic planning is falling foul of the remnants of old-fashioned, central planning. The kind of heavy industries promoted in China’s first five-year plan, for example, still enjoy tremendous privileges. They are dominated by state-owned enterprises, which can count on cheap loans and energy from China’s state-owned banks and utilities.</p>\n<p>According to the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, the weight of these industries in China’s economy almost tripled between 2003 and 2008. China’s leaders now worry about overcapacity in a number of sectors, from steel, cement and aluminium to crushed soyabeans. Because heavy industry is capital-intensive, it creates few jobs, which is one reason why wages have not kept pace with GDP. Heavy industry also tends to be dirty and thirsty, jeopardising China’s increasingly stringent environmental targets. In carrying out the last plan, the communiqué said, China’s leaders had “composed a new epic”. But in the rapid expansion of heavy industry, China’s 11th-plan period was alarmingly reminiscent of its first. </p>","rubric":"China’s new five-year plan is at odds with itself","id":"17314578"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Engine trouble","title":"Buttonwood","content":"<p>MANY factors were responsible for the industrial revolution. But the use of fossil fuels was clearly vital in driving a step change in rates of economic and population growth. So the current rise in the cost of extracting such fuels should be the subject of considerable concern.</p>\n<p>Until the 18th century mankind’s output had been restricted by the amount of physical force that humans (and domesticated animals) could exert and by the amount of wood that people could chop down. Fossil fuels delivered a massive productivity boost. </p>\n<p>In a recent article for the Cato Institute, Matt Ridley, a former journalist at <em>The Economist</em>, argues for the importance of coal in allowing the industrial revolution to be sustained. “Fossil fuels were the only power source that did not show diminishing returns,” he writes. “In sharp contrast to wood, water and wind, the more you mined them the cheaper they became.” A further advantage was that coal supplies were so large. By 1830, Mr Ridley estimates, Britain was consuming coal with an annual energy output equivalent to 15m acres of forest, about three times the size of Wales.</p>\n  <p>In the 20th century oil replaced coal as the cheap fuel of choice. It has had an enormous impact, most noticeably in transport. Think about how much of your daily activity depends on energy—the commute to work, the heating and lighting for home and office, the steel and bricks needed to construct both properties, the transport costs involved in delivering your food to supermarkets (and the energy used to cook it), and so on.</p>\n<p>It was only natural for mankind to exploit the cheapest energy sources first, such as easy-to-extract oil reserves under Saudi Arabia. The problem now is not that the world is running out of energy but that the new sources of energy are more expensive to exploit. </p>\n<p>The key ratio is “energy return on energy invested”. Analysis by Tim Morgan at Tullett Prebon, a broker, estimates that oil discovered in the 1970s delivered around 30 units of energy for every unit invested. By itself this was well down on the returns from oil discovered in the 1930s, which were nearer 100-to-1. Current oil and gas finds, such as undersea reserves, may offer a return between 16-to-1 and 20-to-1. The return on sources such as tar sands and biofuels like ethanol are in the single digits.</p>\n<p>Tar sands and biofuels represent only a small part of global energy use. Nevertheless, to the extent that conventional sources of energy production are declining, the high marginal cost of new sources of energy will slowly drive up the average cost. Andrew Lees of UBS, writing in “The Gathering Storm”, a new book, argues that the global ratio of energy return on energy invested is around 20, corresponding to energy’s 4-5% share of global GDP. Mr Lees thinks the ratio might fall to five over the next decade, implying that energy’s share of GDP could quadruple. That is probably too extreme a forecast. Nevertheless, the direction of change seems clear. If the world were a giant company, its return on capital would be falling.</p>\n<p>The first big oil crisis was in the 1970s when the OPEC export embargo was followed by stagflation. By the 1990s, with oil down at $10 a barrel, the economic impact of fuel costs tended to be downplayed. Developed economies had moved from being manufacturing-based to being service-based, it was argued: the volume of GDP produced for a given unit of energy had accordingly increased. Yet the surge in the crude price to $147 a barrel in July 2008 undoubtedly played its part in exacerbating the recent recession, acting as a tax on Western consumers at a time when confidence was already low. </p>\n<p>That rise in energy prices was driven by demand, however. A surge propelled by the costs of extraction would be a negative productivity shock for the global economy. That would be a particular problem for Europe, which is also facing significant demographic pressures. There will be a decline in the number of people of working age (15-64) in France, Italy and Germany over the next decade. If there are fewer workers, GDP growth will depend on productivity improvements.</p>\n<p>It is possible that some new source of cheap and abundant energy might be developed—the cost of solar panels could be reduced substantially, for instance. The same high energy prices that might crimp economic activity would have the effect of stimulating investment in alternative-energy sources. But there could still be an uncomfortably long period in which the world has to cope with higher energy costs. That is a headwind the global economy could do without.</p>\n<p><br clear=\"all\"><br></p>","rubric":"A rise in the cost of extracting energy will hit productivity","id":"17314626"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Floor to ceiling","title":"Global house prices","content":"<p>THIS time last year, <em>The Economist</em>’s survey of global house prices was a sea of negative numbers. That was then. Of the 20 markets tracked in our latest survey, only four still posted year-on-year declines and only Ireland’s property catastrophe has worsened. (America’s FHFA index, which excludes houses that are financed with large mortgages, was also down, but the country’s Case-Shiller national and ten-city indices rose modestly.) </p>\n<p>Asia’s price rises lead the way, as they did when the data were last published in July. Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia boast the gaudiest year-on-year price increases, even if the rate of appreciation is down a bit from the summer. House prices in China rose by 9.1% in the year to September, compared with a 12.4% rise in May. That is still too fast for the government, which unexpectedly raised interest rates on October 19th and has outlined more measures to cool the market in recent weeks, including higher down-payment requirements and the introduction of a property tax in some cities. </p>\n<p>Our analysis of “fair value” in housing, which is based on comparing the current ratio of house prices to rents with its long-run average, suggests that China has less to worry about than the likes of Australia, which is again the most overvalued of the markets we track. That makes it all the more surprising that Australia’s central bank opted not to increase its benchmark interest rate this month.</p>\n      \n  <p>Europe shows a familiar split between core countries and peripheral ones. Ireland, Spain and Italy continue to suffer year-on-year price declines; German and French homes have shown big gains in value over the past year, a particular turnaround for France since our previous round-up. The British housing sector’s talent for defying gravity may be on the wane. The pace of annual appreciation in the country’s property market has slowed over the summer. British housing is still overvalued—outright falls may loom.</p>\n\n<p>America’s housing market, almost alone among those which experienced a big bubble, is more or less fairly valued at this point, at least according to price-to-rent ratios. But price rises may not last for long. Earlier gains were driven by substantial reward programmes and government subsidies, many of which have now lapsed. America’s overhang of housing inventory may get worse if concerns over lenders’ foreclosure processes jam up sales. The temptation for the country’s 11m underwater borrowers to walk away is another threat (see <a href=\"/node/17305544\">Economics Focus</a>). And being at or below fair value is no guarantee of a bounce in prices: Japanese housing fell by 4% in the year to the end of the first quarter, despite being stuck far below its long-run price-to-rents ratio. </p>","rubric":"Our latest round-up shows that prices are on the rise in most markets","id":"17311841"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Finance and Economics","headline":"Bailing out","title":"The AIA offering","content":"<p>HAVING twice botched the sale of AIA, AIG’s valuable Asian life-insurance arm, America’s Treasury was not about to screw up a third time. It was intent on offloading AIA before the mid-term elections on November 2nd, and the company’s initial public offering (IPO) met with huge demand this week. The buyers have more to celebrate than the sellers.</p>\n<p>A prospectus for the deal was released in Hong Kong on October 18th with an unusually narrow price range of HK$18.38-19.68 ($2.40-2.50) per share. The top end of this range was agreed on with a small group of “cornerstone” investors who committed themselves to buying large numbers of shares. These investors, which include Kuwait’s sovereign-wealth fund and a couple of Hong Kong tycoons, had no illusions about the pressure the seller was under and were in no mood to be generous. The result was a tight cap on the price, regardless of demand.</p>\n<p>The appetite for AIA shares was indeed voracious. Buyers apparently included Chinese state-controlled entities which did not want the publicity of cornerstone status. The Asian order book was closed almost as soon as it opened. Faced with such high demand, the offering could have been pulled and resubmitted at a higher price, which would have raised billions of dollars more for the taxpayers who footed the bill for AIG’s bail-out. But delay would also have pushed the listing beyond the election date, depriving the American administration of useful evidence that it is cleaning up after the crisis. </p>\n  <p>Other things being equal, a post-offering leap in the share price would prove that AIA had been sold cheaply. To mute this embarrassing possibility a novel provision in the prospectus allows the amount of shares issued to be expanded not once, which is common, but twice. This could hike the size of the offering by 38%, dumping an extra HK$43.8 billion-worth of securities on the market. (AIG must retain a stake of just over 30% for at least a year.)</p>\n<p>New investors have more to cheer. The company’s valuation is likely to be well under 15 times earnings for a company with strong growth potential (China Life has a price-earnings ratio of 24). AIA has a uniquely broad exposure to Asia’s growing markets, much of which was acquired decades ago. The end of AIG’s control stops damaging uncertainty over AIA’s future, which has caused market share to fall in some places and opportunities to be passed over in others, notably Vietnam.

Equity will be spread among minority shareholders, a rarity in Asia. Big investments in the IPO by several Asian sovereign-wealth funds should give their governments an incentive to boost AIA’s market access in their countries. That is particularly relevant in China, where AIA has for years been bottled up in a small handful of cities.

Think. Act","title":"BNP Paribas","content":"<p>BAUDOUIN PROT has an unusual habit for a chief executive. A talkative man, the boss of BNP Paribas occasionally forces himself to pause before answering a question. The delay can be unnervingly long. He grimaces. He leans back. He scribbles notes to himself, as if wrestling with the finer points of semiotics. As you wait you wonder how many bad ideas have fizzled out in these self-enforced moments of reflection. Perhaps Mr Prot’s pauses are one of the secrets of BNP Paribas’s success.</p>\n<p>In 1999, when BNP bought Paribas after an epic takeover battle, it crowned itself a European champion even though about 60% of its activity was in France. Today the title is deserved. The bank is Europe’s third-largest by market value and, measured by its borrowing costs, one of the very safest. Less than 40% of its business is now in France. Like Spain’s Santander and Italy’s UniCredit it runs retail operations across the continent (a position boosted by the purchase of bits of Fortis, a failed Belgian bank, in 2009). Unlike them it is also big in asset management, private banking and investment banking.</p>\n<p>Success partly reflects what the bank didn’t do. Although acquisitive, it avoided big deals before the crash. It owns a subscale retail operation in America but did not go on a subprime bender. It specialises in derivatives yet avoided losing billions on credit-default swaps. Mr Prot’s explanation for these dodged bullets is not his habit of reflection, or luck, but “professional management”. He keeps a reassuringly tatty list of the telephone numbers of the top 100 managers in his wallet. The bank is mainly run by a tight-knit group of veterans from the original takeover. The executive suite looks like the set of a costume drama but the top brass still gather there and banter—the nearest you can get to a water-cooler moment in a building in which Napoleon Bonaparte got married.</p>\n  <p>The most important thing these managers did not do was allow the firm to be dominated by its investment bank. Commercial and investment banking contributed almost half of the combined firm’s gross profits in 1999. Today its contribution is about a third. Like Santander, HSBC and JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas has a cadre of executives under instructions not to go native when they are posted to its divisions. “I don’t believe in an autonomous commercial and investment bank separate from the firm,” says Alain Papiasse, who runs the unit and until 2009 led the bank’s asset-management and insurance arm. </p>\n<p>That may help explain why the investment bank was restrained. Although it flirted with danger (a 2007 presentation boasts of its expertise in exotic credit derivatives), it took little “market risk”—by, for example, holding securities. That also means it will be hit relatively lightly by the new Basel 3 capital rules.</p>\n<p>BNP Paribas has bought quite a few retail banks since 1999. Mr Prot says that keeping the firm evenly balanced was not an explicit strategy but was in the back of managers’ minds. When the investment bank grew really fast, between 2003 and 2007, BNP Paribas bought BNL in Italy for €9 billion ($10.8 billion). It overpaid but the integration of BNL is regarded internally as a success. That confidence helped BNP Paribas to pick up bits of Fortis in 2009 at an attractive price, bringing a big retail presence in Belgium and Luxembourg. It also bulked up its asset-management and private-banking arms, run by Jacques d’Estais (who used to head the investment bank).</p>\n<p>How BNP grows now is a bit of a concern. Three-quarters of revenue come from rich economies in continental Europe (although Mr Prot reckons these banking markets may grow faster than over-indebted America, Britain or Spain). The bank has a decent presence in Turkey and north Africa but now that lending without raising deposits is frowned upon, the expansion there will be more branch-based than before—which takes time. Derivatives, the investment bank’s old rocket-fuel, which supplied 70% of its revenue growth between 2003 and 2006, are maturing, partly because of more regulation.</p>\n<p>One priority is to squeeze more from the enlarged group. Mr d’Estais says he can cross-sell more savings products in the bank’s newer branches. In Italy there has been a “huge difference made, like night and day,” since the acquisition in 2006. At the corporate and investment bank Mr Papiasse jokes that he could “have 200 mathematicians calculate a precise answer”, but reckons 5-10% of client revenues are from cross-selling with the rest of the group and that this could double. Having jumped up the European league tables in fixed income, the investment bank is now expanding in equities and in Asia. The firm overall is keen to sell more services to its big base of corporate customers, for example in cash management and trade finance.</p>\n<p>All this might seem a little pedestrian for one of the winners of the crisis. Mr Prot, chief executive since 2003, will probably become chairman in a couple of years, replacing Michel Pébereau. These two veterans could yet unbottle the animal spirits that won Paribas a decade ago. There is the odd hint of hubris—the bank suffers from an inflated view of its capital and funding position, which is reasonable rather than outstanding. </p>\n<p>Yet the overall impression is of discipline. BNP Paribas was recently outbid by Santander for a Polish bank. When Mr Prot warns of the dangers of a “market psychology of complete risk aversion,” he sounds concerned, not gung-ho. BNP Paribas’s recent history is not about being brilliantly contrarian—expanding in downturns and retrenching in booms. Instead it is a story of consistent, tightly managed expansion and risk-taking.

In cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas prices have fallen by up to 50% from their peak; more than half the mortgages in Arizona and Nevada are in negative equity (see map). Yet the problem is national. One in four American borrowers are under water. Over 4m households owe at least twice as much as their home is worth.</p>\n<p>Such inundations have nasty effects. Homeowners that are reluctant to default but unable to sell at a loss are left stuck where they are. This throws sand in the gears of America’s famously fluid labour market. A recent IMF paper attributes 0.5 to 1.25 percentage points of America’s unemployment rate to this factor. Defaults may be an even bigger problem. Job losses will often push underwater borrowers into default since a sale isn’t a realistic option. And as the crisis has dragged on, more Americans have defaulted voluntarily. Estimates from 2009 suggest that 26% of defaults were “strategic” in nature; where equity has fallen below 50% of the loan’s value, around half of defaults are strategic.</p>\n<p>The resulting foreclosures cause lots of damage. Underwater borrowers who sell their home typically get a price 13% below the mortgage value. When homes are foreclosed upon and sold by lenders, the discount rises to 35%, largely because the property is not being maintained. This steep drop in price harms other homeowners. The values of neighbouring houses are pushed down, forcing other borrowers deeper under water. </p>\n  <p>Since lenders bear the brunt of the higher losses that foreclosure entails, their general reluctance to modify the balance of mortgage loans is puzzling. If mortgages could be written down to a value above the likely foreclosure sale price, that would generate benefits for both creditor and borrower. Yet a report earlier this year into the government’s foreclosure-prevention programme showed that principal was forgiven in only 2% of cases. So what is preventing a better outcome? </p>\n<p>Loan servicers, which manage loans on behalf of investors in mortgage-backed securities, may fear lawsuits alleging that borrowers have been treated too generously. Writing down loan values often affects more than one lender—second, third and even fourth mortgages were common during the housing boom. Banks are wary of moral hazard: if word spreads, borrowers with the ability to pay their mortgage may deliberately miss payments in order to get their loans adjusted. </p>\n<p>This last problem can be addressed by changing borrowers’ incentives to default. Contingent write-downs are one example: loans would be written down in increments over three years, but only if the borrower stayed current on payments. Another is a “shared appreciation” scheme in which principal reductions are combined with an equity stake for lenders. Equity gains from subsequent price increases would be split between homeowners and lenders upon sale of the home. </p>\n<p>Whether such ideas would prompt many more write-downs is unclear. They do not address the problem of multiple claims on the same underlying assets, for instance: that would probably require banks holding junior liens to take a more realistic view of their value and write them down. They also bump up against the complexities of modifying securitised loans. John Geanakoplos, an economist at Yale, proposes that this problem be addressed by adopting legislation that strips the responsibility for modifications from servicers and hands it to “blind” government-appointed trustees who would make decisions without knowledge of the loans’ status. Mr Geanakoplos reckons this would address the incentive problems and legal issues faced by servicers, which often have fiduciary duties to holders of mortgage securities. </p>\n<p>A measure called lien-stripping, or, more commonly, “cramdown”, offers another way around the securitisation bottleneck. This would tweak the existing bankruptcy provision known as Chapter 13 to allow judges to write down the value of a primary mortgage. Cramdown is already allowed for other forms of consumer debt, such as mortgages on holiday homes. Research examining the impact of cramdown on agricultural loans found that banks usually got more than foreclosure value on reorganised loans, and that interest rates scarcely rose. At the same time the possibility of a principal write-down in bankruptcy made banks more willing to negotiate reductions pre-emptively.</p>\n<p><a name=\"submerged_acquisitions\"></a><br><strong>Submerged acquisitions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Eric Posner and Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago have proposed a plan whereby an underwater homeowner living in a postcode area which has suffered a certain level of price decline gets the right to approach a judge and begin negotiating a write-down. The pain of bankruptcy should deter opportunists; judges would foreclose on those who cannot afford even a smaller mortgage. The big drawback is that this would damage creditors’ rights. To make the outcome fairer for lenders Messrs Posner and Zingales propose a shared-appreciation scheme. </p>\n<p>More ambitious still is the “right to rent” programme advocated by, among others, Dean Baker of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research. Mr Baker would give defaulting borrowers the option to rent their homes at market rates. The bank would obtain the whole of the equity stake in the house; with rental income still flowing in, sale of the property could be delayed until markets were healthier. Critics point out that property management is not a core skill of banks, but the job could be outsourced.</p>\n<p>There is another way. In the 1990s Mexico cleaned up its debt crisis by offering large government subsidies, of up to 60% of a loan’s book value, to help pay down borrowers’ debts. Such a programme would not come cheap—America has some $766 billion in negative-equity debt—but it would have the distinct advantage of simplicity. The unfortunate truth is that there are no nice options left. Large-scale voluntary write-downs look unlikely—they surely would have happened by now. That leaves a choice between twisting lenders’ arms, throwing public money at the issue, or letting the waters close over people’s heads. </p>","rubric":"The policy options for alleviating America’s huge negative-equity problem","id":"17305544"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Science and Technology","headline":"Eye robot","title":"Computer vision","content":"<p>ROBOTS are getting smarter and more agile all the time. They disarm bombs, fly combat missions, put together complicated machines, even play football. Why, then, one might ask, are they nowhere to be seen, beyond war zones, factories and technology fairs? One reason is that they themselves cannot see very well. And people are understandably wary of purblind contraptions bumping into them willy-nilly in the street or at home.</p>\n<p>All that a camera-equipped computer “sees” is lots of picture elements, or pixels. A pixel is merely a number reflecting how much light has hit a particular part of a sensor. The challenge has been to devise algorithms that can interpret such numbers as scenes composed of different objects in space. This comes naturally to people and, barring certain optical illusions, takes no time at all as well as precious little conscious effort. Yet emulating this feat in computers has proved tough.</p>\n<p>In natural vision, after an image is formed in the retina it is sent to an area at the back of the brain, called the visual cortex, for processing. The first nerve cells it passes through react only to simple stimuli, such as edges slanting at particular angles. They fire up other cells, further into the visual cortex, which react to simple combinations of edges, such as corners. Cells in each subsequent area discern ever more complex features, with those at the top of the hierarchy responding to general categories like animals and faces, and to entire scenes comprising assorted objects. All this takes less than a tenth of a second.</p>\n  <p>The outline of this process has been known for years and in the late 1980s Yann LeCun, now at New York University, pioneered an approach to computer vision that tries to mimic the hierarchical way the visual cortex is wired. He has been tweaking his “convolutional neural networks” (ConvNets) ever since.</p>\n<p><a name=\"seeing_is_believing\"></a><br><strong>Seeing is believing</strong>\n</p>\n<p> A ConvNet begins by swiping a number of software filters, each several pixels across, over the image, pixel by pixel. Like the brain’s primary visual cortex, these filters look for simple features such as edges. The upshot is a set of feature maps, one for each filter, showing which patches of the original image contain the sought-after element. A series of transformations is then performed on each map in order to enhance it and improve the contrast. Next, the maps are swiped again, but this time rather than stopping at each pixel, the filter takes a snapshot every few pixels. That produces a new set of maps of lower resolution. These highlight the salient features while reining in computing power. The whole process is then repeated, with several hundred filters probing for more elaborate shapes rather than just a few scouring for simple ones. The resulting array of feature maps is run through one final set of filters. These classify objects into general categories, such as pedestrians or cars.</p>\n<p>Many state-of-the-art computer-vision systems work along similar lines. The uniqueness of ConvNets lies in where they get their filters. Traditionally, these were simply plugged in one by one, in a laborious manual process that required an expert human eye to tell the machine what features to look for, in future, at each level. That made systems which relied on them good at spotting narrow classes of objects but inept at discerning anything else.</p>\n<p>Dr LeCun’s artificial visual cortex, by contrast, lights on the appropriate filters automatically as it is taught to distinguish the different types of object. When an image is fed into the unprimed system and processed, the chances are it will not, at first, be assigned to the right category. But, shown the correct answer, the system can work its way back, modifying its own parameters so that the next time it sees a similar image it will respond appropriately. After enough trial runs, typically 10,000 or more, it makes a decent fist of recognising that class of objects in unlabelled images.</p>\n<p>This still requires human input, though. The next stage is “unsupervised” learning, in which instruction is entirely absent. Instead, the system is shown lots of pictures without being told what they depict. It knows it is on to a promising filter when the output image resembles the input. In a computing sense, resemblance is gauged by the extent to which the input image can be recreated from the lower-resolution output. When it can, the filters the system had used to get there are retained.</p>\n<p>In a tribute to nature’s nous, the lowest-level filters arrived at in this unaided process are edge-seeking ones, just as in the brain. The top-level filters are sensitive to all manner of complex shapes. Caltech-101, a database routinely used for vision research, consists of some 10,000 standardised images of 101 types of just such complex shapes, including faces, cars and watches. When a ConvNet with unsupervised pre-training is shown the images from this database it can learn to recognise the categories more than 70% of the time. This is just below what top-scoring hand-engineered systems are capable of—and those tend to be much slower.</p>\n<p>This approach (which Geoffrey Hinton of the University of Toronto, a doyen of the field, has dubbed “deep learning”) need not be confined to computer-vision. In theory, it ought to work for any hierarchical system: language processing, for example. In that case individual sounds would be low-level features akin to edges, whereas the meanings of conversations would correspond to elaborate scenes.</p>\n<p>For now, though, ConvNet has proved its mettle in the visual domain. Google has been using it to blot out faces and licence plates in its Streetview application. It has also come to the attention of DARPA, the research arm of America’s Defence Department. This agency provided Dr LeCun and his team with a small roving robot which, equipped with their system, learned to detect large obstacles from afar and correct its path accordingly—a problem that lesser machines often, as it were, trip over. The scooter-sized robot was also rather good at not running into the researchers. In a selfless act of scientific bravery, they strode confidently in front of it as it rode towards them at a brisk walking pace, only to see it stop in its tracks and reverse. Such machines may not quite yet be ready to walk the streets alongside people, but the day they can is surely not far off.</p>","rubric":"Poor eyesight remains one of the main obstacles to letting robots loose among humans.

With a mere 26 officers for every 10,000 residents (Chicago, by comparison, has 46), the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) needs all the help it can get.</p>\n<p>That help may be at hand, with a modification of technology used to predict another type of threat that the city is prone to: the aftershocks from earthquakes. Big earthquakes are unpredictable. Once they have happened, however, they are usually followed by further tremors, and the pattern of these is tractable.</p>\n<p>George Mohler, a mathematician at Santa Clara University, in California, thinks something similar is true of crimes. There is often a pattern of “aftercrimes” in the wake of an initial one. The similarity with earthquakes intrigued him and he wondered if the mathematical formulas that seismologists employ to predict aftershocks were applicable to aftercrimes, too. </p>\n  <p>To test this idea, he and a team of researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, adapted a computer program used by seismologists to calculate the likelihood of aftershocks. They then seeded it with actual LAPD data on 2,803 residential burglaries that occurred in an 18km-by-18km region of the San Fernando valley, one of the city’s largest districts, during 2004. Using the seismological algorithms, the computer calculated which city blocks were likely to experience the highest number of burglaries the next day, and thus which 5% of homes within the area were at particular risk of being broken into. In one test the program accurately identified a high-risk portion of the city in which, had it been adequately patrolled, police could have prevented a quarter of the burglaries that took place in the whole area that day.</p>\n<p>In addition to modelling burglary, Dr Mohler examined three gang rivalries in Los Angeles, using data from 1999 to 2002, and discovered that similar patterns emerge from gang violence as retaliations typically occur within days—and metres—of an initial attack.

The result is disease, particularly diarrhoea. This kills millions of children a year and stunts the growth of millions more. Better water filters, then, could save many lives and improve many others, and Yi Cui of Stanford University thinks he has come up with one.</p>\n<p>Traditional filters work by forcing water through pores to weed out bacteria. That needs power, as well as frequent changes of the filter element as the pores fill up with bugs. Dr Cui’s filter, though, does not screen the bacteria out. It kills them.</p>\n<p>The filter element he and his team have designed is a mesh of tiny carbon cylinders, known as nanotubes, and silver wires laid on top of a thin strip of cotton cloth. Silver is well known to kill bacteria, so Dr Cui conjectured that forcing bugs to pass close to the metal without actually trapping them might lead to their destruction. He also suspected that running an electric current through the silver might help the process, because electrical fields have the ability to break down the membranes that surround bacterial cells. Though silver is a good conductor, carbon is cheaper, and the nanotubes provide the extra electrical conductivity needed.</p>\n  <p>To make their new filter, the team first dipped strips of woven cotton into “ink” containing nanotubes. They then used pipettes to drop the silver wires, which were suspended in methanol, on to the surface of the strips. </p>\n<p>Once dried, the new filters were ready to try. To do that Dr Cui connected them to a battery and ran water containing <em>E. coli</em>, a common bacterial contaminant of water, through them. A few drops of the filtered water from each experimental run were then scattered on an incubation plate to see what was left to grow.</p>\n<p>As they report in the latest edition of <em>Nano Letters</em>, Dr Cui and his team found that when the filter was operated at -20 volts it killed 89% of the bacteria and that at +20 volts it killed 77%. At zero volts, most of the bacteria survived. In a follow-up experiment, in which contaminated water was run through three of the new filters in sequence, 98% of the bacteria were killed.</p>\n<p>Using silver this way might sound expensive, but it is not. The amount involved is minuscule, as is the quantity of electricity needed to keep the filter charged (a small solar panel would be sufficient to supply it).

Kipling suggested they were handprints made by the leopard’s human friend. More plausibly, he had an explanation for what the spots are for: to break up the animal’s shape when it is hiding in the dappled light of the forest.</p>\n<p>These days, the human-handprint theory of the leopard’s spots has fallen out of favour. Instead, a more prosaic idea has gained ground, based on what is known as reaction-diffusion pattern formation, in which chemicals that trigger the differentiation of cells in an embryo interact with one another to produce patterns that are then reflected in the fates of nearby cells. But that, too, has its difficulties. Just how much a process like this can be shaped by natural selection is unclear. </p>\n<p>Reaction-diffusion patterns (which can be created in a laboratory using standard reagents) are simple and deterministic. That simple reactions of this sort sometimes result in cryptic patterns could be a coincidence. Nevertheless, the details of the patterns produced vary, according to things like how rapidly the chemicals diffuse. That could be selected. Different cats do, indeed, have different patterns. So researchers at the University of Bristol, led by William Allen, have been deconstructing these patterns, trying to match the elements to cats’ habits and habitats, and thus show whether the patterns are evolving. They published their results this week in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>.</p>\n  <p>The reaction-diffusion process can be mimicked by a computer, and the program’s parameters manipulated to produce patterns matching those of cat coats. That, the researchers hoped, might help illuminate what is going on. They trawled the world wide web for pictures of wild cats, found the best six for each of 37 species, and roped in a group of human volunteers to choose which of the program’s outputs were most similar to real coats.</p>\n<p>The patterns produced had five parameters: how plain they were, how irregular, how complex, how big the spots were and whether the pattern had a perceptible direction to it. The volunteers’ judgments about which artificial patterns best matched which natural ones were almost perfectly consistent. That allowed Mr Allen to assess which parameters contribute to each species’s pattern, and thus which are correlated with behaviour.</p>\n<p>The biggest distinction—no surprise, but nice to confirm—is that spotted cats are forest cats and plain ones prefer open countryside. In that, Kipling was right. An analysis based on the relationship between the species, though, shows that evolutionary lines can swap from spots to no spots, and vice versa, as the habitat dictates. Moreover, the more a species prefers the forest, the more irregular the pattern it sports, and the more complex. (Size and direction have no effect.) Even among forest-dwellers there are differences. Those that tend to spend their time actually in trees, as opposed to wandering around on the ground between them, have more irregular and complex patterns. And, crucially, there is no relationship between a cat’s pattern and how sociable it is. That knocks on the head an alternative explanation for coat patterns, namely that spots are some form of signal between animals of the same species.</p>\n<p>Mr Allen and his colleagues made one other observation. Some species of cat regularly produce melanic forms—the so-called black panther (actually a melanic jaguar) being the most familiar. </p>\n<p>The data seem to rule out one obvious explanation for melanism: the idea that black cats, with their unusual appearance, have more success hunting because their prey are not keeping an eye out for predators that look like them. Melanic forms, though, are particularly prevalent in species with complicated lives—those that inhabit a range of habitats, are active both day and night, and move between the ground and the trees. What advantage melanism brings in these circumstances is obscure.

He is tough but sympathetic, aghast at the horror yet still hopeful that Africa’s resilient, long-suffering people will somehow win through against the gangsters led by Mr Mugabe who refuse to give up power.</p>\n  <p>“The Fear” is the last in a trilogy that began with “Mukiwa: A White Boy in Africa”, a touching tale of Mr Godwin’s rural upbringing as a doctor’s son whose attitudes are transformed by the guerrilla war, in which he serves as a policeman compelled to fight against his will in Ian Smith’s white-supremacist war against Mr Mugabe. His next book, “When a Crocodile Eats the Sun”, described the economic collapse of Zimbabwe after 2000 (when the campaign to dispossess white-owned farms began in earnest) through the prism of his father’s impoverishment, turmoil, decline and death.</p>\n<p>Mr Godwin’s new book covers the election period in 2008. It shows what happened in the months following the first round of the presidential election when Mr Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party thugs, aided by the army and police, unleashed a campaign of terror against those suspected of backing the victorious opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), forcing its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, to withdraw from the presidential run-off.</p>\n<p>Mr Godwin demolishes any idea that Mr Mugabe’s campaign was just a bit of electoral hanky-panky assisted by some local Zanu-PF enthusiasts going over the top. In relentless, shocking detail, he chronicles the wide scale and systematic nature of the barbarity inflicted on the MDC and the national trauma that resulted. The book is also a devastating indictment of the 15-country Southern African Development Community and especially of South Africa, its leading member, for failing to admit what happened in its bizarre determination to keep Mr Mugabe on his throne.</p>\n<p>The most telling aspect of “The Fear” is Mr Godwin’s description of how blacks and a clutch of whites came together to oppose the tyranny. Roy Bennett, the deputy agriculture minister-designate in the unhappy government of national unity that was eventually formed, emerges as a true hero. A white Zimbabwean in a black constituency, Mr Bennett was elected by a landslide. But for that very reason he is still prevented by Mr Mugabe from taking up his appointment. Instead he was beaten up and imprisoned on spurious charges and is now in hiding in fear for his life. In a string of fine cameos, Mr Godwin movingly portrays Mr Bennett, Mr Tsvangirai and a host of other brave Zimbabweans. </p>\n<p>Zimbabwe and its predecessor, Rhodesia (correctly Southern Rhodesia until Mr Smith compressed the name), have produced a crop of fine writing. As a novel of race and the effect that the harsh colonial experience had on both oppressor and oppressed, Doris Lessing’s “The Grass is Singing”, published in 1950, is still unlikely to be bettered. But more recent offerings, most of them memoirs rather than fiction, have drawn from a deep well of the no-less-tormenting post-colonial experience. For instance, Alexandra Fuller’s “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight”, published in 2002, was rightly hailed as a masterpiece of nostalgic yet subtle reminiscence.</p>\n<p>More recently still, Douglas Rogers’s “The Last Resort” is a delightful tale of his ageing parents’ valiant efforts to keep their hotel going in Zimbabwe’s eastern highlands, at one point turning a blind eye as it became a brothel, amid every kind of Zanu-PF chicanery to confiscate it. Like Mr Godwin, Mr Rogers shows how, in many instances, whites and blacks, with remarkable humour and compassion for each other, have buried their old racial animosities in a common struggle for survival. </p>\n<p> Mr Rogers’s tale is less angry and less polemical than Mr Godwin’s but in its gentle way it is just as revealing. If only—they both seem to say—Mr Mugabe and his vile acolytes could be removed, a core of courageous and decent Zimbabweans is still ready to rescue the country. </p>","rubric":"Robert Mugabe’s gangsters have ransacked a country; they have also prompted some wonderful books","id":"17305434"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Books and Arts","headline":"First among equals","title":"George Washington","content":"<p>\n<a name=\"a_great_man_but_not_a_god\"></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>A great man but not a god</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Washington: A Life.</strong> By Ron Chernow. <em>Penguin Press; 904 pages; $40.

Born on the fringe of the Virginian planter aristocracy, George Washington became a grandee by marriage, proprietor of thousands of acres and master of hundreds of slaves. He shared the tastes of his English contemporaries: Madeira, his coat of arms and fox-hunting. He was as punctilious about his honour, as fine a horseman and as deep in debt as any of them. </p>\n<p>He was also the father of his country and the chief artificer of its independence. The Founding Fathers—Jefferson, Adams, Madison, Hamilton, Franklin—have enjoyed a quasi-religious reverence in the United States to which there are few parallels in any other society. Floating above that circle of demigods is Washington, his name revered in a manner that almost transcends the limitations of a properly republican apotheosis.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Founding Fathers have been protected until recently by a school of biography that barely escaped from hagiography. It was perhaps the revelation (or confirmation) of Jefferson’s amours with his slave Sally Hemings, and more broadly the changed attitude of Americans to race, that freed them from the waxworks in which they had been imprisoned. A new generation of biographers can present them with understanding as well as reverence, as great men rather than marble statuary. Ron Chernow’s “Washington” joins this school. He has done justice to the solid flesh, the human frailty and the dental miseries of his subject—and also to his immense historical importance. </p>\n<p>Mr Chernow examines with an understanding but unblinking eye Washington’s confused attitude to slaves and slavery. He always intended to manumit those of his slaves who were his own to free (as opposed to the “dower slaves” from his wife’s estate) and he did free them in his will. Yet so long as he had them, he was a stern though fair owner. To the modern mind, it is inconceivable that the master of 317 human beings could proclaim, as he did to a white employee, “I never did, nor ever shall, wish to retain any person in my employ contrary to their inclinations.” It is a reminder that in certain ways the Fathers’ minds were different.</p>\n<p>This is a magnificently fair, full-scale biography. Its judgments are lapidary. Mr Chernow concedes that Washington’s “military triumphs had been neither frequent nor epic in scale. He had lost more battles than he had won.” His achievement was to keep the Continental army in being, and so make victory possible. </p>\n<p>If he was first in war, as was said in his funeral oration, he was also first in peace. Washington’s catalogue of accomplishments as president was breathtaking. He virtually invented the executive branch of the new government, its institutions, its mechanisms and above all its spirit. He showed “a disbelieving world that republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule”. </p>\n<p>His last years in office were tainted by the vicious quarrelling between Jefferson’s Republicans, friends of revolutionary France, and Hamilton’s allegedly quasi-monarchist and pro-British Federalists. But Washington was in his lifetime, as he has remained, “first in the hearts of his countrymen”. He gained and kept that place because for all his moral grandeur, he never forgot that he was “merely the servant of the people”. </p>","rubric":"","id":"17305470"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Playground for war","title":"The Caucasus","content":"<p>\n<a name=\"a_beautiful_fought-over_region\"></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>A beautiful fought-over region</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>The Caucasus: An Introduction.</strong> By Thomas de Waal. <em>Oxford University Press; 259 pages; $18.95 and £12.99.

This was no surprise: tension over the Russian-backed enclaves of Abkhazia and South Ossetia had been high for months. Yet, as Thomas de Waal notes, all wars in the Caucasus are about the past as well as the present. To understand the region, one must know its history.</p>\n<p> Mr de Waal, a former journalist (and one-time contributor to <em>The Economist</em>) now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, DC, is an expert on the region, especially on Azerbaijan and Armenia, and on Chechnya, the subjects of two previous books. It is a pity that he has not found space in his latest book to include Chechnya and the north Caucasus which remain Russia’s most dangerous and unstable regions. But as a clear, brief guide to the countries of the south Caucasus, it would be hard to do better than this book.</p>\n<p> The author covers the general history of the area only briefly, yet even here he finds some nuggets (the Caucasus boasts the world’s highest density of languages; Azerbaijan was in 1900 the world’s biggest oil producer). But the story really takes off after the Russian revolution in 1917, when the three trans-Caucasian republics enjoyed a brief independence. With recent events in mind, it is fascinating to learn that Menshevik Georgia waged a brutal war to absorb Abkhazia and South Ossetia in 1918. In the end, though, the Red Army regained control and the three republics became part of the Soviet Union.</p>\n<p> That Stalin was a Georgian did not save the region from his brutality. Yet the experience of the Caucasus under the Soviet Union was not as bad as most, as they largely skipped the second world war and later became a favourite playground of the elite. Oddly, all three of the most recent Russian foreign ministers have connections with the Georgian capital, Tbilisi (the mother of the incumbent, Sergei Lavrov, was an Armenian from there). Sadly, that has not made Russia any friendlier to Georgia.</p>\n<p> It was the break-up of the Soviet Union in the 1990s that produced many of today’s problems. An outbreak of nationalism, fomented by some of the intelligentsia, led to war both inside Georgia and between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The upshot was today’s so-called “frozen conflicts” in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh. It is a term Mr de Waal rightly deprecates: soldiers are often killed on the front-line in Karabakh, and the 2008 war showed how fast a frozen conflict can come to the boil.</p>\n<p>What stands out from Mr de Waal’s account is the negligence of the West. In the 1990s Russia was given a free hand in overseeing ceasefires and providing peacekeepers, despite being an interested party. Ten years later the West went nuts over Mikheil Saakashvili’s “rose revolution” in Georgia and talked of admitting his country into NATO, only to fail to come to Mr Saakashvili’s aid when he overreached, triggering the disastrous 2008 war. The West remains uncertain what to do. Talk of NATO expansion has stopped; nobody in Brussels holds out even a prospect of EU membership to these struggling republics.</p>\n<p> Perhaps their best bet is to learn from a long history of outside interference and look after themselves. Here Mr de Waal is slightly unfair on Mr Saakashvili, in particular. As the war showed, he is headstrong and autocratic. But he has modernised and reformed Georgia, shaking off the remnants of the Soviet legacy. If Armenia and Azerbaijan could follow suit, the Caucasus could yet prosper—surely the best hope for resolving its entrenched conflicts. </p>","rubric":"","id":"17305480"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Sad prophet","title":"Mahmoud Darwish's journal","content":"<p><strong>Journal of an Ordinary Grief.</strong> By Mahmoud Darwish.

The first of three semi-autobiographical prose works (the second, “Memory for Forgetfulness”, was published in English in 1995; the third, “In the Presence of Absence”, will come out next year), it recounts the poet’s house arrest, his run-ins with Israeli interrogators and various spells in jail.

When Darwish and his family left their village in 1948, they expected to return soon. The painful realisation of their loss comes gradually. The trees that are the “ribs of childhood” have been left behind. Palestine has become a homeland defined by those who occupy it, a place that is “a dream in its actuality, and an actuality in its dream”. Occupied though it may be, it is a paradise that is “subject to being regained”. Despite everything, it is attainable.</p>\n<p> Some question the Palestinians’ all-consuming attachment to their land. Darwish answers them simply: “‘Can the land be so holy?’ For the Palestinians, the answer is yes.” He regrets that they have produced no Jeremiah, no one who can “walk around in our streets and in our failings, one who can scourge us and lament us”. Perhaps it was hard for him to see how well he did that himself. </p>","rubric":"A new translation that captures the ache of exile","id":"17305444"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Shards of green","title":"Weeds","content":"<p><a name=\"in_defence_of_nature's_spivs\"></a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>In defence of nature's spivs</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Weeds: How Vagabond Plants Gatecrashed Civilisation and Changed the Way We Think About Nature.</strong> By Richard Mabey. <em>Profile; 324 pages; £15.99.

Harsh stuff—yet it could have been worse. Adam and Eve might have been cursed with ground elder.</p>\n<p>Weeds are often described as plants in the wrong place. In fact, explains Richard Mabey in this delightful and casually learned book, they are in precisely the right place for themselves: next to us. Weeds love cultivated gardens, tilled fields and other unnatural landscapes. Bindweed is more commonly found in railway sidings than in woods or nature reserves. Japanese knotgrass has taken over England’s suburbs but seems unable to penetrate its pristine natural parts.</p>\n<p>Indeed, “nature’s spivs” depend on us. In the early 19th century Oxford ragwort escaped from the botanical garden where it had been interned. It spread slowly from college to college before arriving at the railway station, whence it zoomed up and down the land in the trains’ slipstreams. Danish scurvy-grass has discovered a taste for motorway verges; the spectacular giant hogweed spreads outward from formal gardens along rivers.</p>\n<p>One of the book’s incidental pleasures is to remind the reader that there are worse weeds than those found in the garden. Tumbleweed seeds, for example, can germinate in 36 minutes. Kudzu, a vine that has rampaged across the American south, can grow one inch per hour. The roots of ground elder have been discovered 30 feet underground. Quack grass poisons the maize amid which it often grows, in order to inhibit its growth.</p>\n<p>Other weeds come in and out of fashion: consistency is not a strong point in people’s attitudes to plants. Hellebore, a currently modish flowering plant, was regarded as a weed as late as the 1970s. Your correspondent once lived next door to a couple who had trailed bindweed up a trellis, believing it to be a delightfully vigorous kind of morning glory.</p>\n<p>Which, of course, it is. Mr Mabey would like us to view weeds more benignly, or at least with greater curiosity. He claims to do so himself. Unable to identify one plant growing on his doorstep, he leaves it alone and lets it grow: it turns out to be a giant hogweed. For a while he was a member of a kind of weed fringe group whose members sought out exotic specimens on rubbish tips, then took them home and lovingly nurtured them to see what they turned into.

A physically imposing 79-year-old, he seemed slightly uncomfortable at a press conference at the Metropolitan Museum, where a travelling retrospective of his work has just opened for its final stop. Asked to distil his art for the many who have not heard of him, he responded cheerfully that it was not the job of an artist to “spoon-feed” viewers but to make them feel intelligent. </p>\n<p>For decades Mr Baldessari has made art that challenges convention. Though his work is heavily conceptual, it is not designed to alienate—and is often very funny. In the wake of abstract expressionism, when painting was all, Mr Baldessari was investigating what it meant to make a painting, what the rules were, and how far he could stretch them. In the 1960s he created a series of works that featured mostly text on canvas, painted by sign professionals. One, in black letters on canvas, reads “PURE BEAUTY” (also the name of this retrospective). The words sit there like a taunt, a question, a declaration. </p>\n<p>“I do not believe in screwing the bourgeoisie,” Mr Baldessari explained in an interview. The irony in his work is not designed to reveal what is vacant in art, or what is silly about those who buy it. He just wants people to question what they are looking at. He pokes fun at the art establishment, but he lets viewers in on the joke. Art, he says, supplies “spiritual nourishment”. Asked if a show at the Met sat uncomfortably with his subversive streak, Mr Baldessari did not miss a beat: “I would be happy to hang in a broom closet at the Met. It’s a huge honour.”</p>\n  <p>The exhibition spans nearly half a century and ranges widely. Fewer works are being shown at the Met than in its earlier stops in London, Barcelona and Los Angeles. But the nearly 120 pieces include early paintings, video self-portraits, photo-text pieces and grand-scale collages of found images. One room features a series of paintings that Mr Baldessari commissioned from amateur artists, each with a hand pointing at something (a reference to criticism of conceptual art as “just pointing at things”). Later rooms display his wall-sized arrangements of film stills from the late 1980s, full of dreamlike juxtapositions and faces blotted out by his distinctive circle marks.</p>\n<p>Mr Baldessari attributes some of his experimentation to having grown up in National City, California, a suburb just north of the Mexican border and well beyond the reach of any art scene. He was culturally isolated, but also free from the pressures of rejection. “I was trying to find out what was irreducibly art.” His boldest early work was his “Cremation Project” in 1970, when he ceremonially burned nearly all the paintings he had made between 1953 and 1966. “I really think it’s my best piece to date,” he wrote of it at the time. </p>\n<p>He supported himself by teaching, mainly at the progressive California Institute of the Arts in Valencia. He earned a reputation for being a revolutionary and generous teacher who inspired students to renounce painting and view art as something that happens in the brain. “Artists are indebted to him,” said Marla Prather, who organised the show at the Met. He taught countless people how to make art from the ordinary stuff of life. Now the man himself is finally getting his due. </p>","rubric":"A pioneering conceptual artist is on show at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art until January 9th","id":"17305460"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Books and Arts","headline":"Dancing with death","title":"New film","content":"<p>GOING strong at 80, Clint Eastwood ventures into supernatural territory with his direction of “Hereafter”, a gripping rendering of Peter Morgan’s screenplay about three disparate people who all live in the shadow of death. The three are George Lonegan (Matt Damon), a famous San Francisco psychic who has taken a job in a factory to escape his gift of communing with the dead; Marie LeLay (Cécile de France), a popular French television journalist; and Marcus and Jason (played by Frankie and George McClaren), identical twins who live in a poor London district where they struggle to conceal their mother’s heroin addiction from child-welfare workers.</p>\n<p> At the beginning of the film Marie, on holiday in South-East Asia, has a near-death experience during the 2004 Asian tsunami. Unable to return to her former life, she takes a leave of absence and ends up writing about the scientific evidence for an afterlife (“You’d better publish it in England or America,” counsels her sceptical French boss). Marcus’s brother dies in a car accident and he goes looking for a psychic who can communicate with the dead, encountering a series of dotty frauds until he happens on George’s old website and realises that this guy could be the real thing.</p>\n<p>The characters are obsessed with death but “Hereafter” sets out to be popular entertainment on a big canvas, examining the workings of destiny in the lives of its people. Lonely George, whose supernatural gift has wrecked his chances with a giggly beauty he meets at an Italian cookery class, goes to sleep listening to Charles Dickens’s audio books. Indeed, Dickens turns out to be the improbable thread that will bring all three characters to the London Book Fair, where Sir Derek Jacobi is reading from “Little Dorrit”—and the film evokes Dickens’s universe: ghosts, orphans and all.</p>\n  <p> Although the film pays brief visits to the Great Beyond, Mr Eastwood’s eye for detail (like a Che Guevara sticker on a locker in George’s factory which is preparing to lay off 30% of its workers) is comfortingly everyday. Moreover, Mr Morgan’s melodramatic web catches more bits of contemporary reality than do most docudramas. For those who don’t mind two-hanky finales it is a grand evening out. </p>","rubric":"Clint Eastwood’s latest film “Hereafter” is released this week in America and comes to Europe in January.

Though often classed as one, it is not really a science. That scientists use it to describe their interpretation of reality is not quite the same thing. Nor, though, is it an art—not, at any rate, in the modern meaning of that word. The aesthetics of the subject, which any mathematician will tell you are the driving force behind his passion, are not obvious to the senses in the way that those of a painting, a symphony or a play are. Yet Benoît Mandelbrot’s celebrity beyond the academy is largely due to art in its modern, sensuous, sense. For the “set” to which he gave his name, when computed, drawn on a complex plane and suitably tinted, appealed greatly to the senses—as a million posters, greetings cards and T-shirts, bought by people who had not the faintest idea what it was, attest. </p>\n<p>The Mandelbrot set is a collection of points in the complex-number plane. The formula for calculating these numbers is <em>z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c</em>, where <em>c</em> is a complex number and <em>n</em> (representing the digits 1 to infinity) counts the number of times the calculation has been performed. <em>Z</em> starts as any number you like, and changes with each calculation, the value of <em>z<sub>n+1</sub></em> being used as <em>z<sub>n</sub></em> the next time round. Sometimes the value of <em>z</em> remains finite, no matter how large <em>n</em> gets. In that case, <em>c</em> is part of the Mandelbrot set. Sometimes <em>z</em> shoots off to infinity. In that case, <em>c</em> is not part of the set. The boundary between the two is the swirling fractal line that so appeals to the eye, and the colours of the points outside the set indicate how long the calculation takes to start shooting off to infinity.</p>\n<p>Fractal. Complex-number plane. Lewis Carroll, no mean mathematician himself, asked Alice to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast. These could easily have been two of them. </p>\n  <p>First, then, the complex plane. This is the space on which all numbers, real, imaginary and combinations of the two, can be plotted. A real number is the familiar sort from normal arithmetic. An imaginary one is a multiple of the square root of -1. </p>\n<p>Mathematicians struggled for centuries with the question of what, multiplied by itself, gives the answer -1 before one of them, Leonhard Euler, suggested that the best way to deal with the problem was to invent a new symbol (he chose <em>i</em>) and live with the consequences. It works. And, as Euler’s successor, Carl Friedrich Gauss, was to discover, if you plot real numbers on one axis of a graph and imaginary ones on the other, you create a plane that represents both sorts of numbers. Complex numbers, which have a real and an imaginary part added together, are the points on this plane that do not lie on either axis.</p>\n<p>The invention of complex numbers was a watershed in mathematics. It also marked the moment when maths began to slip away from being part of the armamentarium of any educated person and towards the dizzyingly abstruse field it has become today. But a fractal is something a ten-year-old child might hit on. </p>\n<p>What is the length of a country’s coastline? Any encyclopedia will give you a figure. Yet stand by the sea and watch the irregularity of its edge, and you begin to doubt. It is not just a matter of tide and waves. Even measuring the boundary of a static body of water is no mean feat. The closer you look, the more irregular the line. That, at bottom, is what describes a fractal. When you magnify it, it rushes away from you and becomes a simulacrum of its larger self, eventually infinitely long. </p>\n<p>Dr Mandelbrot asked himself the coastline question, and answered it in 1967, in an essay called “How long is the coast of Britain?”. In 1975 he invented the word fractal to describe his discoveries. Extending fractals into the plane of complex numbers followed in 1979. But the breakthrough that made them famous was the ability of computers to plot them in a way that is easy on the eye. Thus were launched the posters, the cards and the T-shirts.</p>\n<p>Before all this Dr Mandelbrot worked in the obscurity that modern mathematicians have resigned themselves to. He had followed, albeit belatedly, a path familiar to Jewish intellectuals driven from eastern Europe by the rise of the Nazis. His family fled Poland for France before the second world war and, though they stayed there for the duration, the young Benoît afterwards oscillated between France and the United States before settling for America in 1958. Once there, he worked for IBM. Among other things, he modelled electrical noise. Which, it turns out, is fractal. That it was the transmogrification of his formula by computers which brought him fame is thus appropriate. </p>\n<p><a name=\"game,_set_and_match\"></a><br><strong>Game, set and match?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For a time, fractals seemed the answer to everything: the shape of clouds, the growth of organisms, even why the night sky is dark. Then the world lost interest. </p>\n<p>Perhaps it should not have. For among Dr Mandelbrot’s beliefs was a conviction that financial-market movements, too, have fractal forms, rather than the familiar bell shapes of “normal” distribution that Gauss also described. If Dr Mandelbrot’s belief was correct, trading models based on Gauss’s distribution are wrong.</p>\n<p>That markets are not Gaussian has now been accepted. Dr Mandelbrot’s interpretation, however, has not. Even if it had been, the bankers might not have noticed. They preferred algorithms to geometry. </p>","rubric":"Benoît Mandelbrot, father of fractal geometry, died on October 14th, aged 85","id":"17305197"},{"edition_date":"2010-10-23","section":"Economic and Financial Indicators","headline":"Overview","title":"","content":"<p>Industrial production in <strong>America</strong> fell by 0.2% in September, the first decline in more than a year.
